ALL OVER ARIZONA.

News Culled From Vari
ous Sources.

What the Prominent People
Are Doing.

Their Movements and Investments
Personal and General
Territorial News.

Mesa Free Press: The people of
Mesa and vicinity appreciate with
gratitude the fact that their supply of
water for irrigation is no longer inter
fered with by washouts. The canal
heading stands as solid as the rock of
Gibraltar, and no matter how high the
river may become, not a dollar's dam
age is done and the canals are kept
running full of water. The work done
by the Consolidated Canal company is
worth thousands of dollars to this val
ley for this reason alone.

N. Spring Street, Near Temple
Los Angeles
And
San Francisco.

Tucson Citizen: The law library of
ex-Attorney General Heney was ship
ped to Aransas a few days ago. It con
sisted of nearly 5,000 pounds of books.
He has concluded to locate in Aransas
which bids fair to spring with a sin
gle bound into a big seaport city.

Prescott Courier: Rev. Chase
preached his farewell sermon at the
Marina street M. E. church last even
ing. Accompanied by Mrs. Chase he
will leave for Phoenix this week to
take charge of the church at that
point. He has been in charge of the
Prescott church for three years, during
which time the church has largely in
creased both as to devotees and dol
lars. Hence, Mr. Chase has been a
two-edged success, cutting both ways.

Williams News: Williams is improv
ing right along, despite no incorpora
tion and all venomous words by jeal
ous friends on the outside and barna
cles within. Many residence buildings
of a neat, substantial and costly kind
are now under way while several large
mercantile buildings are started and
others talked of to a reasonable cer
tainty. The railroad company is com
ing forward with the right spirit to
aid in the general improvement. A
new depot is one of the assured cer
tainties of the near future, while a
large, handsome and commodious read
ing room will be erected by the com
pany for the use of its employees,
which will be a boon to this class of
men, who represent such a large and
intelligent per cent of our population.
Let the good work proceed and every
loyal citizen put his shoulder to the
wheel.

Winslow Mail: Winslow is not on
a "boom," but if almost any other place
along the line of the Atlantic & Paci
fic had as many improvements in
course of construction, it would be
called a "boom." Next spring, unless
some unforeseen accident occurs, the
"boom" may commence. By that time,
work on the reservoir sites and feed
ing ditches running into them will, in
all probability, be under way. Then
Winslow will take such a jump that it
can justly be called a boom. This is
no idle talk. Wait and see.

Winslow Mail: Winslow can boast
of at least one good sportsman. Mr.
Benton was out hunting for a few days
the past week and brought the carcas
ses of eight deer, besides leaving two at
home as he came in. Mr. Benton is
one the writer would like to have in
the party if he were going out. There
would be very little likelihood of going
to bed hungry, if he were one of the
party.

Globe Silver Belt: S. A. Parnall,
manager of the Old Dominion Copper
Mining & Smelting company, and A.
G. Pendleton made the trip to San
Carlos and return this week, over the
freighting road, to ascertain how much
damage was done by the late flood.
The road is washed out considerably,
but it is in better condition than they
expected to find it, and teams will be
able to come over it without much
trouble. The scarcity of teams at Ft.
Thomas is the greatest difficulty to
contend with.

Nogales Vidette: Hon. M. J. Nugent,
having completed his term of office as
immigrant inspector, at this port, left
Saturday for his home at Yuma. Mr.
Nugent made many friends in the line
city who would be glad to see him
back again soon.

Flagstaff Sun: Navajo county pays
its recorder $1,000 per annum. Last
month the receipts of that office were
$30. The recorder thanks his stars
that the office is a salaried one, as the
fees would only pay his board.

Tucson Citizen: The young daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Bagg, former
ly of Tombstone but now of Los An
geles, will shortly leave on a trip to
Europe and will it is expected be gone
from four to six months.

Tucson Citizen: In response to a
telegram offering him an important
case, ex-Attorney General Heney wir
ed from Aransas Pass that he could
not accept any more Arizona business.

Florence Tribune: Mr. Will F.
Cooper has accepted the position of
fireman on a Southern Pacific engine
and left for the scene of his new duties
Tuesday.
