THE PRACTICAL FEED.
The farmers of this and other sections are coming to realize more
and more the value of ground feed and the profitable results obtained
using it. Not only can the feed be bought and stored when the
price is lowest but it is a proven fact that ensilage and ground feed
is more easily and thoroughly digested thereby obtaining better re
sults from less feed.

In order to obtain the best results the Ensilage Cutter and the Feed
Grinder must be dependable and efficient. We can warrant the
STOVER ENSILAGE CUTTERS and STOVER GRINDERS.
Come in allow us to explain them in particular or mail to you a
descriptive booklet.
