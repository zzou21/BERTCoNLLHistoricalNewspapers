the greatest medicine of the present age." Walter Clark, Bluefield,
W. Va. Mr. Clark is a member of the firm of Clark & Co., prom

Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey
is a wonderful remedy in the treatment and cure of all diseases of
the lungs, throat and stomach and for all weakening and wasting
conditions. It is an absolutely pure, gentle and invigorating stimu
lant and tonic. When taken at mealtime it stimulates the mucous
surfaces and little glands of the stomach to a healthy action, thereby
improving the digestion and assimilation of the food and giving to
the system its full proportion of nourishment. This action upon
the digestive process is of great importance, as it brings to all the
tissues and organs of the body the nutriment necessary to their
sustenance and indirectly to the whole system strength and vigor.
It is prescribed by doctors and is recognized as a family medicine
everywhere.
If in need of advice write Medical Department, The Duffy Malt
Whiskey Company, Rochester, New York, stating your case fully.
Our doctors will send you advice free, together with a valuable il
lustrated medical booklet, containing rare common sense rules for
health, which you cannot afford to be without, and some of the many
thousands of gratifying letters received from men and women in all
walks of life, both old and young, who have been cured and benefited
by the use of this great medicine and who continue to enjoy good health.
Sold by druggists, grocers and dealers or direct $1.00 a large bottle.

RECORD
MADE
IS
When Airship Crosses English
Channel Twice Without
a Stop in 90 Minutes
DOVER
Hon. Cha
(England), June 3. The
Stewart Rolls, captain in
the London section of the
air service, vindicated the
army Anglo-Saxon
in aeronautics by crossing the Eng
lish Channel twice this evening with
out alighting.
He made the round trip between
Dover and Calais in ninety minutes.
While two Frenchmen, Louis Bleri
ot and Count De Lesseps have cross
ed the channel in an aeroplane it re
mained for an Englishman in an Am
erican machine to perform the double
feat.
The distance across between the
two points is twenty-one miles, so
that his over-water flight of forty-two
miles without a stop, establishes a
new record.
Captain Rolls left Dover at 6:30
o'clock. Almost perfect conditions
prevailed. He lost no time in maneu
ver, but after describing a circle head
ed for the coast of France. In antic
ipation of the flight torpedo boats
steamed at full speed across the
straits but the pace of the aeroplane
was swifter.
Captain Rolls sent his machine to
a height of 600 feet, and at that al
titude he skimmed through the air
like a great bird. The motor worked
perfectly.
The crowd that watched the start
confidently awaited the return and it
was not long before the speck which
those who had telescopes saw dis
appear on the French coast reappear
ed, growing larger with every minute.
When finally the aviator became vis
ible to the naked eye cheers arose
from the spectators and as he soared
toward the landing place made fa
mous by Bleriot he received a tre
mendous demonstration. He alighted
at 8 o'clock
at almost the same spot as Bleriot,
showing little signs of the strain of
his magnificent flight.
KING'S DAUGHTERS
A meeting of the King's Daughters
will be held at the rooms of Mrs.
Farrington at the H. Smith residence
in this city on Saturday evening at
8 o'clock. A full attendance of the
members is desired as business of
importance will come before the meet
ing.
If you want something that's good,

iciftednhQA

Walter Clark of Bluefield,
W. Va., was laid up with lung
trouble, unable to work for
two months. He tried nu
merous medicines without
result until he took Duffy's
Pure Malt Whiskey. It com
pletely cured him and now
he is in perfect health.
"Having been afflicted with a seri
ous lung trouble and used
many medicines without result, in
fact, I was unable to do any work
whatever for two months. Duffy's
Pure Malt Whiskey was recom
mended, and I commenced taking
the same. I desire to state that I am
entirely cured, having been pro
nounced so by my physician.

Railroads
Raise Rates
WASHINGTON, June 3. Undaunt
ed by the governor's procedure un
der the Sherman anti-trust act, by
which a part of the proposed in
crease of freight rates in the terri
tory west of the Mississippi river was
suspended by injunction, railroads in
the east and middle west yesterday
filed with the interstate commerce
commission tariffs of increased rates.
Attorney General Wickersham de
clines to indicate what course he will
pursue in behalf of the government
and the senate, just on the verge
today of passing the administration
rate bill, hesitated and finally post
poned action until tomorrow.
By last night practically every rail
road system in the north from the
Atlantic to the Pacific had filed with
the interstate commerce commission
legal notification of proposed increase
in commodity rates. The increases
range from 3 to 31 per cent.

LIFE TO
Lydia E. Pinkham’s
Vegetable Compound
Chicago, Ill. I was troubled with
falling and inflammation, and the doc
tors said I could not
get well unless I
had an operation.
I knew I could not
stand the strain of
one, so I wrote to
you sometime ago
about my health,
and you told me
what to do. After
taking Lydia E.
Pinkham’s Vegeta
ble Compound and
Blood Purifier I am
to-day a well woman.” Mrs. William
Ahrens, 688 W. 63d St., Chicago, Ill.
Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable Com
pound, made from roots and
herbs, contains no narcotics or harm
ful drugs, and to-day holds the record
for the largest number of actual cures
of female diseases of any similar medi
cine in the country, and thousands of
voluntary testimonials are on file in
the Pinkham laboratory at Lynn,
Mass., from women who have been
cured from almost every form of
female complaints, inflammation, ul
ceration, displacements, fibroid tumors,
irregularities, periodic pains, backache,
indigestion and nervous prostration.
Every such suffering woman owes it to
herself to give Lydia E. Pinkham’s
Vegetable Compound a trial.
If you would like special advice
about your case write a confiden
tial letter to Mrs. Pinkham, at
Lynn, Mass. Her advice is free,
and always helpful.

TRUTH

No.

Two things only are needed:
a little capital.

Confidence counts for as much as cash. A co-operative company enlisting the capital of a number of
small investors may effect as much as any millionaire. Good ground is an essential. Intelligent selec
tion of a site for drilling, and honest management of the company's affairs will give a fair chance for
success. It doesn’t take but a few thousand dollars to put down a well, and a few hundred dollars sub
scribed by each of ten men is adequate capital, although not one out of the ten perhaps could afford to
spare enough singly to buy the rig and bore the hole.

Once a well is struck, you have an income producer.
BARRELS A DAY IS WORTH $100,000.

You can figure that out for yourself. With oil at a dollar a barrel, a hundred-barrel well earns $100 a day,
or $36,500 a year. Allowing for the payment in royalty of one-eighth of the product, there remains over
$30,000. That will pay for all operating and office expenses, labor, cartage, tankage, and transportation,
and still leave a net income of more than 10 per cent (more likely 15 per cent) on the valuation of $100,
000. You want to be one of those who are going to sink these oil wells. All right, send in your subscription.
