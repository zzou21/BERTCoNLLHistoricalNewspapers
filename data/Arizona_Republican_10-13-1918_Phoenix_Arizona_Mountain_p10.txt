Lubricant carbon remover solves the
carbon problem. When your motor
loses power, when it knocks, bucks and
overheats, don't monkey with the car
buretor. Send for a can of Lubricant
Carbon Remover and pour two to four
tablespoonfuls into each spark plug
hole. Follow directions and the motor
will do the rest. It works, like a ca
thartic. You will see the proof in the
cleaned spark plugs, and you will get
more power and more miles out of
every gallon of gasoline. Every can
guaranteed. Price $1.25 prepaid.
Prompt attention paid to mail orders.
