RAILWAY TO

Construction of Lincoln Extension
Began Yesterday
The construction of the extension
of the Phoenix city railway's suburban
line from Lincoln Place to
Orangewood, began yesterday when
Manager Mitchell started the stringing
of ties. This morning F. G.
Twitchell of Los Angeles, a member
of the engineering force of the Los
Angeles Pacific railway, who has been
engaged in running the lines for the
First avenue line, accompanied by a
transit man and a local crew, will
begin the final survey for the road.
Just as soon as the rails arrive
the construction of the track will
be started, and this it is thought will
be sometime during the present week.
There is therefore no doubt of the
building of the road just as soon as
the men can throw the material together,
as far as Orangewood.
Orangewood, however, is not the
proposed terminus, for the plan is to
extend the line on to Glendale, but
to date it is only assured as far as
Orangewood. R. P. Davie, general
manager of the Southwestern Sugar
and Land company is very much interested
in getting the line clear
through to the sugar town, and has
been working hard to that end for
the last six months. He was here
yesterday for the purpose of straightening
out the difficulties that have
been encountered between Orangewood
and Glendale and was quite successful
in respect of two perplexing
matters, the nature of which was not
disclosed. There are others, however,
that have not been settled and Mr.
Davie is devoting himself energetically
to overcoming them. If he does not
succeed it will be his first failure in
these parts, but the greater the cooperation
given him, the sooner will
this great utility be assured.
ADVICE TO MOTHERS Mrs.
Winslow's Soothing Syrup should always
be used for Children's Teething.
It soothes the child, softens the gums,
allays all pain, cures wind colic and
is the best remedy for Diarrhoea.
