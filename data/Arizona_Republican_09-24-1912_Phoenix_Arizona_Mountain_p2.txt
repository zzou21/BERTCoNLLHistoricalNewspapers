CIRCUS HIGH RECORD IS
CONDITION MAINTAINED

Thousands of People from
All Parts of Valley Crowd
to Town to See Big Show.
An Old-Fashioned Cir-
cus. “We went to the animal fair
The birds and beasts were there,
The big baboon
By the light of the moon
Was combing his auburn hair.
The monkey, he got drunk,
And climbed up the elephant’s trunk,
The elephant sneezed,
And fell on his knees,

But what became of the monk, the
monk, the monk...?” The usual parade around the ring, and then
the vision of some person acting
something upon a big stage, making
motions with their hands, and shout-
ing occasionally to mail-clad denizens
of the Roman and Egyptian world
that flocked the foreground. Without
the ballet the spectacle would have
been so much time wasted. Whoever
constructed the terpsichorean mazes
of the ballet as presented had a mas-
ter’s knowledge of the art. The
drills were perfect. Two hundred wo-
men danced in perfect rhythm, many

by the usual valley planters’ auto-
mobile to attend the circus.
From early morning to late at night
the streets of the city teemed with
people. The restaurants and hotels
were crowded, and between the shows
the parks held many a person anxious
for an opportunity to rest. During
the shows the streets by no means
assumed a deserted aspect. The af-
ternoon crowd at the circus under the
big tent and at the side shows was
estimated at ten thousand people,
while the night show was just as
large, yet despite this the streets dur-
ing the show were as busy looking
as upon a Saturday afternoon in the
shopping season, yet withal it was
a good-natured crowd. The people
were packed so thickly in the big
tent that it took a good three quar-
ters of an hour for all of them to
get out in the afternoon. Less time
was necessary at night as the load-
ing process had begun and the walls
of the tents were taken down to let
the people out.
The first impression of the big show
gathered from the morning parade
was not a very prepossessing one. The
outfits as shown on the street were
filthy dirty; the animals, especially
the elephants, looked as if they need-
ed some washing. The only clean
animals noticed were the wild fellows
in the cages. The lions and tigers
were fat and sleek, but the horses,
although fat, looked tired, probably
from the fact that the fag end of
the season is nearing. The men
driving the wagons and floats looked
as if they needed a bath, a shave, a
shampoo and a shine. The general
consensus was that had the outfit
been in Mexico and had advertised as
did the circus yesterday they would
have all been jailed for not coming
up to the promises of the ads.
Out at the big tent, however, an
entirely different impression was
gathered as far as the cleanliness of
the performers and the animals went.
The uniforms of the bands around the
ring were not worthy of comment,
but may have been kept that way in
order to make the costumes of the
performers much more delightful to
the eye. The grounds had been well
wet down early in the afternoon, but
with ten thousand people passing in
and out, the hundreds of horses chas-
ing around the ring, the dust was
there just the same. It was the same
old circus dust, sawdust and dust and
full of jungle smells, as much a part
of the circus and as much a re-
minder of youth and the joys exper-
ienced by the incorrigible unwashed
who used to pack water for the ele-
phant, as the tawdry and tinsel tights
and trapezes themselves.
The performance was a regular old-
time circus. It was noticeably and
pleasingly devoid of thrillers in the
nature of death-defying leaps, loop-
the-loops, and “Girl in Red” stunts.
The old-fashioned horseback excel-
lence, wonderful aerial trapeze work,
and performances of trained animals
filling the entire program.
It began with the Antony and Cleo-

No More Blowing, Snuffl-
ing or Morning Hawking to
Dislodge Mucus, When You
Breathe Germ-Destroying
HYOMEI.

HYOMEI (pronounce it High-o-me)
is guaranteed to end the misery of
catarrh or money back.
Breathe it; destroy the catarrh
germs, and soon hawking and snuff-
ing will cease.
Breathe it and crusts will no lon-
ger form in the nose; mucus will not
lodge in the throat; all inflamma-
tion will leave the membrane of the
nose and throat and your head will
feel clear and fine.
Breathe it for coughs, colds and
sore throat; its soothing, healing, an-
tiseptic action is better than all the
stomach dosing remedies in Creation.
Complete outfit which includes in-
haler and bottle of HYOMEI, $1.00.
Extra bottles of HYOMEI 50 cents at
Central Drug Store and druggists
everywhere.
To break up cold in head or chest
overnight or to more quickly con-
quer stubborn catarrh, pour a scant
teaspoonful of HYOMEI into a bowl
of boiling water, cover head and bowl
with towel and breathe the vapor for
several minutes before going to bed.

patra spectacle and pageant. The us-
ual charming daintiness and grace,
while others with merely the me-
chanical motions that come from long
practice. The eyes of the thousands
were fixed upon one little girl in
startling pink tights who occupied the
center of the front lines of the bal-
let. More than one enconium upon
her graces was passed during the
two performances. After some min-
utes of ballet which was most pleas-
ing, the big curtain at the left of the
stage opened and three mail-clad
warriors came hustling forth bearing
the body of one of the men who had
been effusive and super-efficient in
gesture in the early portion of the
spectacle. The readers of the pro-
gram found this was Antony coming
home off a shutter shot. He was
taken to the top of the stage, Cleo-
patra then took a fit by way of va-
riety and finally fell over Antony’s
body and the whistle blew closing the
curtain. It was well it closed.
Then came the sure enough circus.
Riding of the most masterly charac-
ter by men and women. The work of
Miss Wirth was wonderful. This
chunky young woman did all the dif-
ficult bareback riding tricks that the
men before her did and did them
with much more grace and greater
abandon. The Japanese troupe of ju-
jitsu artists and wrestlers was im-
mense, getting all sorts of apprecia-
tion from the audience. The seals
performed their tricks of balancing,
the elephants stood on one leg, danc-
ed ragtime, played ball and played
musical instruments, the little strong
woman surprised the crowd as
much by her size as her strength, the
Shetland ponies and the monkeys in-
terested the little ones, while the
trapeze work of three splendid troupes
provoked the applause of the entire
assembly. Finally the races ended
the show.
No circus would be complete with-
out the clowns. The clowns yesterday
were on hand singly and in couples, in
trios and quartettes. Shorty, the Ari-
zona dwarf, led the fun-makers in
most of their spasm-causing tricks.
The patrol wagon, the clown police,
knockabout stuff galore, new and old,
was pulled under the big tent just
as it has been since the first circus
was organized, yet it brought the
good will of the audience to the sur-
face. Laugh after laugh rang over
the rings at the antics of some great-
er fool than his brother. A clown
made up as Teddy and leading a bull
moose received considerable applause
in a circle of the ring. In leaving
the crowd was good-natured in spite
of the time it took to get out. The
circus had been old-fashioned enough
to make many remember their kid
days. Pink lemonade, popcorn, pea-
nuts and hot dogs were consumed in
the same unstinted fashion as twenty
years ago. Circus day comes but
seldom.
With all the pleasure of the big
show there were many things at which
rightful exception can be taken. The
most noticeable was the fact that the
ticket-sellers after the show was about
half over began selling duplicate
tickets with the result that many
people who had purchased seats and
had checks were bothered by ushers
coming up with more people for
those very seats. This did not occur
once but many times, and indicates
either a woeful lack of organization
or the prevalence of a rabid spirit of
graft on the part of the organization.
No persons should be allowed to sit
in the aisles yet this was done in
many instances.

“Howdy, Bill! Did you go to the
circus yesterday?”
“Well, yes; you see I had to take
the kids.”
“You’re a liar; you are the biggest
kid in your family.”
