SPORTING NEWS

COYOTE CLASS GOES ON TWO
GAME NORTHERN TRIP SOON


The big northern trip for the High
school is now certain. Sixteen men will
leave Phoenix Thursday morning for

Flagstaff and Winslow in a special
Pullman car. Coach Geary and Ath
letic Director Osborne will guide the
destinies of the big huskies throughout
the journey.
The football squad will have posses
sion of the private car from Thursday
morning to Tuesday morning. It will
be their home during the entire trip;
no hotel bills to contend with, and ab
solutely no chance to break training,
as Night Watchman Geary will guard
the entrance like a prize fighter guards
his kisser.
The first game of the trip will be
played at Flagstaff, Friday, the 27th,
and the following game will be played
with Winslow Monday, the 29th. Both
northern teams, it is rumored, are
whirlwinds and will force the Coyotes
to handle the pigskin with care.
Weather conditions are against the
home team, as it is reported extremely
cold up in the highlands.
Manager Hess says that it will mat
ter a little, but his team is not a bit
bashful and can get used to anything
and as long as the wheeled palace runs

they will return home with the meat.
Geary’s fighting terrors have been

getting honest-to-goodness workouts
all week and are getting in fair con
dition. But when they leave Phoenix
next Thursday morning there will not
be one that couldn’t whip a bulldog.
They look like whales and at the end
of this week they will be able to out
run any rabbit that roams the desert.
It has taken Coach Geary a good bit of
hard labor and time to get the boys
in trim, and the result of his efforts are
beginning to show themselves.
All the members of the team are
anxious to find out who are the lucky
ones to make the trip. Coach Geary
has given out the names of those who
in all probability will make the trip.
Even this list is subject to change.
Bell, Casey, McAfee, Gorrell, Caldwell,
Sutter, Caraker, Duncan, Pinney,
Hultz, Lyall, Detweiler, Wilkey, Irvine,
Sanders and Luke, including Geary,
Osborne and Hess.
There will be some big disappoint
ments for those who thought they knew
more about the game than the coach,
and have failed to prove it to him, and
the sad consequence is they are out of
luck when the team goes north.

CLASH ON FIELD

INTERFERENCE IS

STANFORD REASON

The reorganized Outlaws will clash
with the White Sox this afternoon

at 3 o’clock on a local diamond.

This will be the first game to be
played by the Outlaws since the team
has been strengthened by the arrival
of several new players. De Priest, a
former local star, who has been play
ing in the east during the early part
of this season, will be on the mound
for the Outlaws, while Bonham and
King will do the receiving.
Arrangements have been made to
have benches along the first and
third-base lines for the accommoda

tion of about 100 people. This inno
vation, which was recently made at
one of the sandlot games, proved very
popular with the fans.
Following are the line-ups:
Outlaws—Bonham, c; De Priest, p;
Ogdenhoff, 1b; Bradley, 2b; R. West-
fall, ss; Haggorne, 3b; Benvenuto, lf;

LOTS OF QUAIL

The quail season for the state of
Arizona opened last Sunday morn
ing with hundreds of hunters in the
fields of game. With the enormous
number of quail now in the valley,
the hunters are able to secure the
limit in a short day’s shoot. The
season is open on ducks, quail, rab
bits, geese, snipe, doves and deer.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 21. “Inter
ference,” one of the outstanding fea
tures of the American game of foot
ball, is the basis of Stanford Uni
versity’s objection to that code and
largely responsible for the fact that
the Palo Altans still are adhering to
the English Rugby game. A statement
given out recently by Dr. Frank
Angell, head of the faculty athletic
committee, is, in part, as follows:
“Some 14 years ago we started in
on the general athletic policy for
which Stanford now enjoys some
considerable reputation throughout
the country—the policy of general
participation. The chief obstacle in
the way of the spread of that policy
was found to be the American game

of football. Chiefly for this reason it
was abolished. Specifically the rul
ing was passed a few years later that
no football game admitting interfer
ence would be allowed as an official

game on the campus.

“As is evident from the football
conditions in most American colleges
the objections to the American game
which were chiefly operative in its
abolishment are still valid, and there
is not the slightest prospect that the
ruling as regards interference will be
rescinded in any prospective time.
“The question of preference for one
form of game as opposed to another
is not at issue here. A university
administration has no business with
preference which it would try to
impose on the students; but a uni
versity administration has, or should
have, a clear cut athletic policy, and
in pursuance of that policy it should
take such measures as it thinks wise.
“The policy of Stanford for more
than 14 years has been that of open
ing up and broadening athletics—
that is, the policy of general partici
pation. With that policy the Ameri
can game of football is in conflict.
To think that there is going to be
any change of reversal of this policy
and bring down the football situation
here to the level that exists in most
American colleges today, is out of the
question.

HIGH BASKETBALL

The first scheduled High School
basketball game of the season will be
staged at the Armory Wednesday
night, with the Tempe High. The
game will start promptly at 8 o’clock
sharp.
The Coyotes have opened the season
with several open date games and de
feated their opponents by large scores.
It is rumored that the neighboring
school has a speedy team; if the rumor
is bunk, the Armory next Wednesday
night is no place for Tempe, as Phoe
nix plays remarkable ball. They took
the Indians into camp by a safe score,
who are considered the whirlwinds of
the southwest.
Coach Carpenter may be considered
the father of basketball in P. H. H.
This is one of the few activities that
was a failure until it was taken over
and made a success by him. The school
was never aware of the fact that such
excellent material existed around the
crimson and black campus.
The basket tossers have been out
every evening putting the round oval
in the baskets as if they were throw
ing it into a lake. Captain Wright says,
“if we can’t clean up the state this
year I’ll eat my shirt, and yes, even
eat my trousers to boot, and that is
sure going to be a dusty tourney of all
those teams that even attempt to face
my line-up.”
