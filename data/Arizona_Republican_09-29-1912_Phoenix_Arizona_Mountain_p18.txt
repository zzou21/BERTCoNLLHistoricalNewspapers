Arraignment of an Opium Refiner;
Hester Cattle Case Ended

Messrs. Bennitt and Bar-
ringer Will Entertain
Members of the National
Geographical Society at
Crater Mine This Week

E. J. Bennitt left last night for Cra-
ter, Ariz., where he will meet D. M.
Barringer of Philadelphia who is ac-
companying a party of members of the
National Geographical Society who are
making a tour of the world. Messrs.
Bennitt, Barringer and their associates
are the owners of the Crater mine
where they will entertain the members
of the Geographical Society next Tues-
day. The Crater mine, like which there is
no other in the world, is ten miles
from Canyon Diablo. It is called the
Crater mine from the fact that it is a
bowl-shaped depression from the bot-
tom of which the mining is being done.
The crater is three-quarters of a mile
in diameter and 600 feet deep. It is
situated on a plain surrounded by a
ridge 120 feet high.
The depression is supposed to have
been formed by a monster aerolite
which must have been by far the larg-
est of which there has ever been any
trace. The ridge was formed by the
displacement of the earth at the time
of the mighty impact.

Ah Fee, a Chinese laundryman of
Glendale, was arraigned in United
States court yesterday on the charge
of manufacturing opium for smoking
out of the raw material. He was giv-
en a week in which to plead.

The Hester Cattle Company case dis-
appeared from the docket, an agree-
ment having been reached between
the company and the government re-
garding the disposition of 1158 head
of cattle which were seized by mount-
ed customs inspector, Thomas Hester
of Lamy, N. M., the head of the com-
pany, being arrested on a charge of
smuggling.
Hester stated that the cattle broke
across the line while with inadequate
help he was trying to drive them to a
Mexican ranch where he intended to
keep them, pending negotiations with
the officials of the bureau of animal
industry for their admission under the
quarantine regulations.
The matter was adjusted several
days ago, the cattle were dipped un-
der the inspection of one of the sani-
tary officials, and were loaded and
shipped to Lamy.

In the case of Frederick C. Bolen
and others against the Tucson Ma-
sonic Lodge and various other de-
fendants a contest of the will of the
late John Bolen, though better known
as D. J. Boleyn, a voluminous answer
was filed by Judge William Lovell,
one of the defendants.

Thirty drill holes have been sunk in
the bottom to a depth of from 800 to
1100 feet, all of them in powdered silica,
much of which is 98 per cent pure.
For many years this crater has been
the wonder of the scientific world and
it has attracted scientists from all
parts of the world.

The idea that mineral wealth might
be found there had been entertained
for many years but it was not acted
upon until about twelve years ago
when S. J. Holsinger began interesting
capitalists and scientific men in the
enterprise.

SALT LAKE, Sept. 28.—Prepara-
tions for the entertainment of visitors
and delegates to the Twentieth Na-
tional Irrigation Congress have been
completed and Salt Lake expects to
entertain at least 30,000 visitors next
week. In addition to the Irrigation
Congress the Utah State Fair and
the semi-annual conference of the
Mormon church will add greatly to
the number of visitors during the
week of September 30.
The Irrigation Congress will be
opened formally by the Queen of Ir-
rigation and Empress of the Valleys
in the Tabernacle on the morning of
September 30 and the noted Taber-
nacle Choir of Salt Lake, augmented
to 500 voices, will render the Ode to
Irrigation under the personal direc-
tion of John J. McClellan, who com-
posed the music for the Ode. A
stupendous electrical pageant, where-
in the history of irrigation will be
portrayed by means of electric lighted
floats, will be a feature of the first
evening’s entertainment.
President Taft has designated Gen-
eral Marshall, consulting engineer for
the Department of the Interior, as his
personal representative at the Con-
gress. Governor Hunt of Arizona
will be among the principal speakers
before the Congress.
