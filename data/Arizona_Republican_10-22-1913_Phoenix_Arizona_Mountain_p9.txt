TEMPE PREPARES FOR
VISIT OF EL PASOANS
School Students and Citizens of the
Town Will Entertain Booster
Special Next Friday
With the doors of the town wide
open and the slogan of every citizen
a musical "cowboy welcome to the
visitors," Tempe will entertain the El
Paso business men for a couple of
hours or more here next Friday af-
ternoon. No official announcement of
the
coming of the El Paso business
booster special to Tempe has been
received, but those who remember the
single hour's enjoyment of the Texas
business men here last year know
well enough that the special will nev
er visit the Salt River valley without
a stop-off at Tempe. Through its
newspapers the fact is intimated that
the excursionists will spend an hour
or so in Arizona’s educational center.
So the only conclusion to be
drawn is that it is up
to the town
to provide something that will be
well worth their while, and a few
hours' preparations last evening
would verify all of this. Last year
where each of the El Pasoans in an
informal way spent one of the most
enjoyable hours of their lives here,
the celebrities of next Friday are to
be met with some preparation.
With as pretty a bunch of young
women as can be found anywhere in
the world right here at home, Tempe
is in a position to give the El Paso-
ans one of the best times of their
lives. Last year it was all "girls"
with the visitors, and if the past
goes as a forecast for the future in
any way the El Pasoans are sure of
an unsurpassed welcome at the
Tempe Normal.
The schedule of the special calls
for the arrival of the guests in Tem-
pe at 12:00 o'clock Friday. The time
for departure is 1:15 but it is a safe
bet that they will not get away with-
in an hour of that time.
The tentative program for the vis-
itors while in Tempe finds the scene
of the entertainment laid out at the
Tempe Normal. Automobiles will be
supplied and the guests given a short
ride over the town, eventually to be
deposited on the Normal campus.
The El Pasoans have a band, also
some singers and speakers, so that
with a combination of local and Tex-
as talent an excellent program is
beaming. The specific scene for
the celebrities will in all probability
be located on the quadrangle.
Even in the few short hours that
Tempe citizens have to awaken to
the fact that the one hundred El
Pasoans are going to pay them a
short visit, interest over the occasion
is manifested by everyone.
Further and detailed plans for the
entertainment of the Pass City busi-
ness men in Tempe will be arranged
at a special meeting of the Tempe
Board of Trade to be held this evening
at the city hall. A called meeting of
this organization implies that every
citizen of Tempe is expected to be
present. 7:30 is the hour.
"An entertainment of the variety
distinct from the general trend of
such programs" will be the slogan
prepared tonight and carried out next
Friday.
HAY STILL BLAZES
All through Monday night and yes-
terday the hay barn and enclosed
bay of 1000 tons owned by Alfred
J. Peters, which unaccountably caught
fire early Monday evening, continued
to burn. Five minutes after the blaze
was first discovered practically every
part of Tempe was almost as light
as day. The scene on the butte was
most unusual and extremely pretty.
Constant watch was kept over the
fire and adjoining premises Monday
night and yesterday and fortunately, for
the least stir of wind,
nothing else caught fire. Where for-
merly had stood the largest hay barn
ever erected in Salt River
valley, now lies a smoldering mass of
ashes intermixed with twisted and
bent corrugated sheet iron. While
the total loss is big, in that the hay
would have realized big prices in the
winter market, the actual loss to Mr.
Peters is comparatively small. Mr.
Peters intends to rebuild with a
more fireproof structure at an early
date.
T. N. S. BOARD IN SESSION
Bills, reports and above all, the
letting of the contract for the archi-
tectural work on the new industrial
arts building soon to be built on the
campus, furnished almost an unlim-
ited supply of business for the Tempe
Normal School board when they met
in session at the president's office
Monday evening. All the members
were present, C. O. Case and Clay
F. Leonard, of Phoenix, and Dr. B. B.
Moeur from Tempe. A. J. Matthews,
president of the Normal, was also
there. To draw up architectural
plans and specifications for the pro-
posed arts building, Peabody & Smart
of Phoenix were awarded the con-
tract. Actual work will be started on
the building possibly about the first
of December. Sundry bills of the
past month were audited and ordered
paid. The report from the dining-
hall for the first month was received
and approved. Contracts for electri-
city and gas were considered by the
board but no definite action taken,
matters being held up pending fur-
ther investigations. To the Standard
Oil Company of Los Angeles was
awarded the contract for supplying
oil to the Normal heating plant this
year, a matter of a half dozen or
more carloads.
HIGH SCHOOL BOARD
The Tempe Union High School
board met in session at the princi-
pal's office Monday evening and au-
dited bills for the past month. Various
matters of importance were to have
come up for discussion, but excitement
over the Peters fire called for a hasty
adjournment just as the last bills
passed from consideration.
THE MOTHERS' DEPARTMENT
The mothers’ department of the
Tempe Woman’s Club will meet next
Friday afternoon at the home of Mrs.
J. H. Woods in the first real busi-
ness session since its organization.
All members of the parent club wish-
ing to work in the auxiliary depart-
ment are requested to attend.
NEAR DISASTROUS BLAZE
The explosion of a gasoline lamp
under a chocolate heater in Stacey
Bros.' confectionery store here about
six o'clock Monday evening threaten-
ed for a couple of minutes damage
to local and adjoining buildings. In
attempting to put out the flame,
which was first discovered envelop-
ing the lamp, the contained gasoline
was scattered all over the floor, the
fire spreading instantaneously. Pres-
ence of mind and quick work with
a water-soaked blanket extinguished
the blaze which without a minute
or two’s start would undoubtedly have
wrought thousands of dollars’ worth
of damage.
RETURNED TO SAN DIEGO
Andrew Nielsen and Dr. R. G.
Wray, both of San Diego, left last
evening via the Espee for their home.
Dr. Wray arrived in Tempe about a
week ago and has since been the
guest of Mr. Nielsen.
TONIGHT’S SHOW
At this evening's movie show at the
Goodwin opera house an exception-
ally fine two-part picture will be run,
entitled "The Great Canton Mystery."
It has made a great hit as a detec-
tive drama. The other two pictures
are "The Black Smallpox Scare," a
comedy, and "Jocular Words."
PYTHIAN SISTER SESSION
Initiation work and a real banquet
will feature the second session of the
year when the Pythian Sisters' lodge
of Tempe meets at the I. O. O. F.
hall tomorrow evening. The order
is just getting down to real work now
after their summer vacation without
so much as a single meeting. Im-
portant matters of business, a class
for initiation and the eats, last but
by no means least, will give them
about all they can do in one evening.
ALL DAY GATHERING
Mrs. E. C. Adams’ division of the
Ladies’ Aid Society of the Methodist
Church will meet at the home of
Mrs. E. L. Thew for an all-day ses-
sion tomorrow. The president re-
quests that all ladies please take
their thimbles and one prepared dish
for lunch.
