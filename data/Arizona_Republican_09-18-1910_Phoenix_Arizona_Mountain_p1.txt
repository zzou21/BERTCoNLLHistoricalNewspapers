COMMENDATIONS

OF

PRESIDENT TAFT
Col. Roosevelt Endorsed Many Accomplishments of

His Successor's Administration
QUOTED HIM AS AUTHORITY FOR CRITICISM OF COURTS
The Colonel Appeared in the Stronghold of His Enemies
At Syracuse and Dared Them to Stand Up in Fight.
He Met Woodruff and Others and in Private Fra
ternized and Jested With Them About Their Polit
ical Differences

Syracuse, Sept. 17. Coming into the
stronghold of the opposition, Colonel
Roosevelt boldly challenged the op
ponents of his political doctrines to
come out into the open and fight if
they dared. He prophesied that if
they did they would be beaten.
The former president also gave a
warm commendation of President Taft
as a public official and expressed his
approval of a number of the accom
plishments of the administration.
Colonel Roosevelt did not endorse the
administration as a whole. What he
did have to say, however, placed him
on record for the first time in regard
to many of the more important fea
tures, breaking the silence which he
had maintained steadfastly on the sub
ject except for a few brief references
to his successor which he made while
on his western trip.
He also defended his recent criti
cisms of two decisions of the United
States supreme court, made in a speech
at Denver, and he quoted the words of
William Taft, written when a federal
judge, in support of his contentions
that the people have a right to criti
cise the decisions of the courts.
When Colonel Roosevelt arrived at
the state fair grounds, where he spoke,
they were thronged by a crowd of
more than 40,000. Before he went to
the speaker's stand, Colonel Roosevelt
rode around the mile track at the head
of a parade and received a cordial wel
come. Almost all the members of the com
mittee which will have the colonel in
hand during his stay here are identi
fied with the Onondaga county repub
lican organization, of which Francis
Hendricks, ex-superintendent of insur
ance, is the head. Hendricks is a mem
ber of the republican state committee
and voted against Colonel Roosevelt
when the state committee refused to
indorse him for temporary chairman
of the republican state convention.
The colonel spent the evening at the
home of Lieutenant Governor Horace
White, who gave a dinner for him.
There he took the hands of the men
who are taking part in the fight against
him. Woodruff, chairman of the state
committee, one of the leaders of the
opposition, met Roosevelt here today,
shook hands with the colonel and ate
dinner with him. Roosevelt and his
adversaries met each other with cheer
ful faces and jested about their dif
ferences.
Mr. White said the time had come
and the colonel arose. He was in fight
ing trim as he faced the crowd. He
shook his clenched fists into the air
and thundered forth his message with
all the energy he could muster. Sev
eral times he departed from the text
of his prepared speech to inject re
marks to show how earnestly he meant
what he said.
"I wish my opponents would come
into the open," he said. "They shoot
from the bushes." He declared in an
other place, "But you could not make
them come into the open and fight the
issue."
Another remark which caused the
crowd to cheer was made just as he
had again dared his opponents to put
themselves on record against him.
"Friends, they won't do it," said the
colonel. "They criticise me, but they
will walk as though they were tread
ing on eggs before they take the oth
er side."
After he had asserted that the lead
ers of business must act as servants
of the people, and that corporations
must be creatures not masters of the
people, he added: "To paraphrase the
words of Patrick Henry, 'If that be
socialism, make the most of it.' "

MURDEROUS ASSAULT
ON AN ELDERLY MAN
THE MOTIVE WAS ROBBERY, BUT
LESS THAN A DOLLAR
WAS SECURED.

Highwayman Was Captured, But Re
leased When Victim Failed to
Identify Him.

Dan McDonald, aged 63, while going
peaceably toward his home on South
Central avenue about 11 o'clock last
night, was held up, robbed of his
purse, containing less than a dollar,
and his door key, which was attached
to it. The thug is a Mexican, who
feigned drunkenness, and he was cap
tured on suspicion, but was liberated
when McDonald said he was not the
assailant. Later it was demonstrated
that he was the right man, but wheth
er the authorities will get hold of him
again is doubtful, though there are
now several who can help identify
him if he is caught.
The specific act of holding up Mc
Donald was accomplished by hitting
him a terrific blow on the left ear
with some weapon, presumably a rock.
When he reached the police station
one side of his shirt was saturated
with clotted blood and his face and
neck were covered with it, while his
hair was full of dust and his clothes
showed that he had been rolled
around in the dirt. He was as sober
as a judge, and told a straight story,
which there could be no reason for
doubting.
Though McDonald's assailant was a
Mexican, he spoke two words of Eng
lish with decided fluency when he
told him to "shut up," after McDon
ald began to yell "murder." The thug
was a slim-built man of medium size,
wore a light shirt, dark pants and a
black hat. These facts he noted in
the moonlight before the assault, for
the man had followed him for a long
distance.
McDonald says he lives alone in a
little house just this side of the old
race track, and is a sufferer of
rheumatism, though his lungs are all
right, as he later demonstrated. On
the way home he noticed shortly after
he left the Center Street depot that
someone was following him, and
though he staggered like a drunken
man he was gradually gaining on him.
Farther down the street McDonald
decided that the sidewalk was hardly
big enough for both of them, so
he took the road. The Mexican did
the same, and as the pursuit was get
ting uncomfortably warm, McDonald,
believing the man was merely drunk
and undesirable company, stepped a
little to one side to let him pass. As
he did so the thug, who was carrying
his hands in a peculiar way, smashed
him on the side of the head. The
blow was unexpected, and so forceful
that it knocked him down in the dust
and rather dazed him, though he knew
enough to appreciate what was going
on and began to yell "murder" as loud
as he could.
"And my lungs are all right," he
added, in telling about it, "for I have
lived in these western mountains a
great many years; my lungs are all
right, and I used them to the best of
my ability. He told me to 'shut up,'
but I just kept yelling."
Recorder Thomas, who lives on
South First avenue, can also testify
as to McDonald's lungs, for he heard
the cry of murder and telephoned the
police station. Captain Connors dis
patched Policeman Frank Fowler on
a motorcycle, and in a very few min
utes he had met McDonald, and pro
ceeding a little farther, came up with
two or three citizens who had been
aroused and who had a Mexican in
custody. The Mexican was taken to
McDonald, who, after carefully look
ing him over, said he did not believe
he was the man. He was searched
and did not have either the pocket
book or the key in his possession, and
was liberated. The officer brought
McDonald to the police station and
turned him over to Captain Connors,
who summoned Dr. Beauchamp to at
tend him.
Officer Fowler and two other police
men returned to the search and some
of the policemen or citizens who were
participating soon found McDonald's
key lying in the road where the Mex
ican had been apprehended and had
dropped it, thus proving conclusively
that they had had the right man, but
his victim in his dazed condition had
not identified him. Whether they will
get him again is doubtful, though
there are several who have now had
a pretty good look at his features and
can help identify him if he is caught.
The purse was not recovered at latest
advices.
