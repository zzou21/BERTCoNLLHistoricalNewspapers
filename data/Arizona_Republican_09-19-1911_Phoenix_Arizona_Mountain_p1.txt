ROUNDUP
Deputies Adams and Mick
ey follow thieves into
mountain fastnesses and
bring home three pris
oners. GUN PLAY WAS
FEATURE OF CHASE
Deputy Mickey and one of
the supposed thieves had
a lively revolver duel
in which the latter was
wounded.
Manuel Arviso, Gregorio Granillo
and Jesus Morales in jail charged
with stealing horses in this valley; one
Mexican, whose name was not learned,
wounded in a battle at the Condon
ranch at Walnut Grove Sunday even
ing, escaped; the recovery of a
horse stolen from J. J.
Clark two months ago and another
from Carl Casey last Wednes
day night; the two stolen animals and
three other horses ridden by the mem
bers of the sheriff’s posse, returning
overland under the charge of Bob Har
per, the third member of the sheriff’s
posse; that is the summarized report
of Deputy Sheriff Jeff Adams and Lew
Mickey who arrived here with the
prisoners on train No. 3 last night at
10:45, having boarded it at Kirkland.
Arviso’s connection with the case is
yet to be determined. The other two
under arrest and the man at large are
the three trailed by the officers from
this valley, since the latest theft last
Wednesday night. Arviso has a lease
on the Condon ranch but the fact that
he gave shelter to these men and that
the horse stolen two months ago was
found at his ranch, together with the
fact that he has been arrested at vari
ous times in Yavapai County on similar
charges, tends to complicate matters
for him. None of the officers was
hurt in the battle though many shots
were exchanged. That the missing
man is wounded was his own state
ment to Mrs. Arviso, as he commandeered
a Winchester and a belt
full of cartridges in the moment of his
hasty flight. He said “I am leaving,
and I am leaving wounded.”
About two months ago Clark’s mare
was stolen, rewards offered and a
thorough search made without result.
Last Wednesday night Casey’s fine
mare vanished. Thursday was spent in
a thorough search and Friday the trail
of three horses was discovered and
traced as far as the Agua Fria river.
Friday night Deputy Sheriffs Adams,
Mickey and Harper, armed and equip
ped, set out to follow it. At Castle
Hot Springs they were joined by a
young man named Lutgerding in the
employ of John Hardee. They kept to
the trail easily though it led over a
frightful country and far from the
traveled roads. Sunday afternoon they found them
selves approaching the Condon ranch
and saw five men engaged in baling
hay. The party separated, Adams and
Mickey going to the upper side of the
field near the house to get through a
gate. Harper and Lutgerding went to
the lower side of the field, three quar
ters of a mile away. Going to the
nearest available place, Adams and
Mickey hitched their horses and ap
proached the Mexicans. Arrived at
the haystack there were but four of
them in sight. Jeff asked where the
other man was and was answered that
he had gone around the stack. Adams
went around the stack but could not
find him. It was evident he had fled.
Mickey went to a nearby knoll
alongside a cornfield. Adams climbed
upon the haystack to keep a lookout.
He saw the wanted Mexican in the
cornfield and signaled to Mickey who
had not yet been seen by the Mexican.
Mickey and the Mexican saw each
other simultaneously and the officer
ordered him to throw up his hands.
He threw up his right hand. (It was
learned later that he was left-handed).
Adams says he remarked to the Mexi
cans that if the fellow did not get the
other hand up pretty soon he would
be a dead one. He knew Mickey.
It was the Mexican’s move and he
made it. He brought up his left hand
firing, Mickey firing simultaneously.
Several shots were exchanged until the
Mexican seemed to be out of ammu
nition and a cartridge caught in Mick
ey’s automatic which stopped his fir
ing. Then the Mexican whirled and
mounted Casey’s horse which was
hitched in the corn nearby and which
the officers had not seen before. The
Mexican rode rapidly toward the lower
end of the field, evidently not seeing
Harper and Lutgerding who were
awaiting his arrival. On his approach
he was ordered to surrender. Instead
of doing so he slid off the horse on
the opposite side and made a quick
run over a little hill to Arviso’s house.
Adams and Mickey followed the fugi
tive, but as he was mounted, though
bareback, they could not get close
enough to continue their negotiations
with him. When the Mexican left
Casey’s horse it was taken possession
