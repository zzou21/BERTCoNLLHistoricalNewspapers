Our Reputation Stands
On the character and class of work
we turn out. For more than seven
years we have stood back of our
work in Phoenix and expect to con
tinue to do so in the future. That's
the kind of business man we like to
deal with, and believe this policy will
appeal to you. Let us fit your glasses

RED LIGHT DISTRICT BROKEN
UP At last the elimination of the
Red Light district will take place.
Any immoral woman caught within
the present reservation after this
morning will be arrested and prose
cuted to the full extent of the law.
This is the result of Mayor Christy's
notification to District Attorney Bul
lard that school would open at the
new Grant school for colored in the
morning. Bullard has signified his
intention of directing the execution of
paragraph 275 of the penal code of
Arizona. It is not known whether
Owner Bordoni of the Red Light dis
trict will attempt to rebuild another
district, although it is rumored that
he will purchase a tract of land
southwest of the old place, just far
enough so that it does not come
within the 400 yard limit. A general
exodus of the women in that district
is taking place from Phoenix. By
tomorrow practically all of them will
be gone.
A RUN ON LUCK It went in
the wrong direction, but Chairman
Hoghe of the board of supervisors
is not dismayed. A few nights ago
sometime after midnight the whole
eastern sky was lighted by a con
flagration. It was at first thought
that the Desert Inn was burning up.
Telephone inquiries throughout the
country failed to locate the fire
though everybody replied that they
saw it. It was not known until yes
terday what was burning and then
Chairman Hoghe brought word that
the bonfire cost him eighty tons of
hay. How the fire originated is
not known. It was thought by some
to be incendiary and others thought
that the origin was even worse—a
cigarette. But that was not all. There
were several horses in the field and
among them a colt, which became
panic stricken and ran up the slop
ing side of the hay stack, fell off
on the other side and broke its neck.
That was all the damage for that
night. But a day or two later Mr.
Hoghe bought eleven cows for $63
apiece and when he got them home,
one of them lay down and died. He
has since then bought a half hundred
others and they are all alive.

BACK FROM DENVER Miss Nel
lie Battin of the Phoenix High
School faculty, returned yesterday
from Denver, where she has been
spending her annual vacation.
HERE ON BUSINESS Frank E.
Kidder, of Los Angeles, a represen
tative of the Standard Oil Company,

Wrenn at 14 Center street or at the
Boehmer drug store be located.

GUESTS OF THE CANNIBALS
Misses Mabel Pratt and Helen Mc
Intyre, both members of the high
school faculty, returned yesterday
from the Society Islands. They have
been gone for over three months, ex
posed to the supposed cannibals in
the tropical regions. They stayed
the major part of their time on the
Tahiti Island of the Society group,
but they visited all the other ones
in small vessels.
HE HAS GOOD REASON If Post
master McClintock should appear on
the street this morning with tousled
hair, unshaven face and in a general
unkempt and dilapidated appearance,
there need be no general excitement,
for the colonel has a good excuse.
Last evening some miscreant of bur
glarious instinct invaded the porch
of his residence and carried away a
padlock, a razor and a couple of
combs.
A TERRIBLE SCARE Last even
ing about the hour the Saturday
night crowds begin to thin out on
Washington street, a couple of Mexi
can youths reported at the police sta
tion that they had been accosted by
another young Mexican who flourish
ed a vicious looking knife and threat
ened to cut them up into shoe strings.
Night Captain Conners went after
him instantly and overhauled him
near Pettid's bakery. His hands were
in his pockets when the officer came
up and the latter tapped them gently
through his trousers and told him to
elevate them, the hands, not the
trousers. After he had done so the
captain carefully ran his own hand
into the Mexican's pocket and found
a can opener. He was taken to jail,
not so much for this act which was
probably a wild sort of bluff, as on
general principles, for he was recog
nized as the lad who was in jail a
month ago, and who is believed to
be a little unbalanced mentally. He
undoubtedly made a swing with the
can opener, that in the night might
look very much like a knife, and the
other boys were not unwise in taking
fright.

THE CHAUTAUQUA POSTPON
ED The management wishes to an
nounce that there will be no Chau
tauqua conducted in Phoenix this
fall, nor at any other point on the
circuit. This being campaign year
in many states they were unable to
get the big star attractions they
wanted. They had obtained a pro
gram equal to that presented by
many of the large chautauquas in the
East, but not as strong as was de
sired. They decided to postpone the
chautauqua, rather than to disappoint
the people. They have every assur
ance that next year they will be able
to obtain the attractions wanted.
