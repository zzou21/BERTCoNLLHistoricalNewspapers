If Tempe now has players enough
to insure the completion of the sched
ule, it also has managers enough to
render the financial life of Secretary
Kehoe of the Phoenix club miserable
in the extreme. He does not now
know to whom he should apply for
the final understanding about the
game this afternoon, though he is
certain there will be a game. The
Republican's correspondent at Tempe
writes that there will be a game at
Phoenix, that the lineup is so and so
and that Phoenix had better look a
little out or get badly walloped by
the rejuvenated Sluggers.
This would be awful, decides Yates,
so he goes and says to Captain
Ritchie, "Me good captain, we must
prepare for the emergency, straight
way." So they two get together and
prepare for the emergency straight
way just like that. Those mentioned
as possible pilots of the Tempe team
are Frank Baum, Fred Joyce, Fred
Hudson and a few others.
If what Tempe says and what
Phoenix says is true, and undoubtedly
it is, there will be a big league ex
hibition at Grant park. It is a case
of arrested vigor, and all the pep that
has been storing since the break in
the schedule for the Tucson games
will be turned on this afternoon.
Busted Mitt Bill Barngrover will hurl
for the Phoenicians. He will be
caught by Cook, first cousin to "Doc."
Barton. Warren and Clow of the new
nickname will officiate in the outer
reaches of the field. Ritchie has

spread his infield out in exactly the

the same way as before, Tognerio,
himself, Whitt and McDevitt, right
in a row.
Tempe will pitch Old Reliable Ovie
do. A new man named Mitchell will
be the sparring partner, and the rest
line up as follows: Griffen, lb; Hud
son, second; Burg, short; Mullen,
third; Harris, Moeur, A. Spikes, Kelly
and Ewing, outfielders. This team
with several other substitutes has had
two or three fast work outs and is
generally conceded to be about as
strong as the other Tempe lineup.
Outside of the two unknown quanti
ties, Mitchell and Burg, the near field
of the southsiders is just the same
as before, and Albert Spikes and
Ewing are the only outfielders whose
numbers are not down in the book.

Sacks "Snuck" Up

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13. The

Sacramento Wolves came from be
hind today, for bunched hits off Kil
lilay, with walks and hit batters over
came the two-run lead, tied the score
with three runs, all in the eighth,
and in the ninth Pitcher Killilay was
put out of the game by Umpire Held
for disputing a decision, and Pitcher
Lohman lost the game, 4 to 3, two
innings later by hitting the batter
and a wild pitch. With one out the
last of the eleventh, Hallinan was
safe when Gardner dropped Beard's
throw; Kenworthy was hit by a pitch
ed ball; Reitmeyer's out advanced

both runners; Hallinan made a false
start down the third-base line and
Lohman heaved a high one over to
Stroud for the wild pitch; Hallinan
scoring the winning run. Klawitter
was relieved by Stroud when Gard
ner opened the tenth inning with a
single.
Score R H E
Sacramento 4 9 2
Oakland 3 10 2
Batteries Klawitter and Lynn; Kil
lilay and Rohrer. (Eleven innings).

The El Paso Game
Yates, Kehoe and company are hav
ing the time of their lives trying to
get the El Paso game straightened out.
But the Mavericks will not be roped
for branding, for they want a definite
guarantee, which the local manage
ment can't give unless they are se
cured in some way by the town. The
gate does not nearly pay for the ex
penses of an outside team, so there
must be revenue from elsewhere to
liquidate the obligations. The Mav
ericks play in Miami on the 19, 20
and 21st of the month, and here
on September 22, providing proper ar
rangements can be made. The team
will come by auto from Miami, after
having made it thus far from El Paso
by train. The barnstorming tour

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 13. The
class of the Venice pitching staff
could not stop Los Angeles today.
The home club won the second vic
tory of the week with a ninth-inning
rally, by a score of 5 to 4. When

Carlisle tied the score with a home

run to left center in the ninth, Kane

followed with a single and Chech
appeared to be weakening, but there
was no further scoring by the Tigers.

In the Angels' half of the ninth, Mag

gert opened with a double down the

third-base line. He advanced to

third on Howard's out and scored on

Krueger's sacrifice fly to right. Fer

guson, who started for Venice, pitched

well until the fourth inning when the
Angels bunched three hits for a brace

of runs. He was touched for three

more in the sixth. Koestner went to
the rescue in the seventh, and the

Angels tallied again on a single hit.
Baum pitched the last inning.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13. San
Francisco won another game from
Portland, the league leaders, today
by a score of 6 to 1. The Seals
knocked Hagerman out of the box
in the third inning, after he had al
lowed four hits and three runs, when
Stanley went in, with two on bases
and none out. During the remainder
of the game, although he allowed five
more hits and yielded the Seals three
more runs, Stanley struck out eight
men. Fanning pitched for San Fran
cisco and allowed seven hits. He
received effective support throughout.
