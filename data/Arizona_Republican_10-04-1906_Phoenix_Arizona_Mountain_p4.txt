THREE FUTURITIES

WON IN A YEAR

A great deal has been said of late
about the admission of arms into
Mexico. It has been set forth in the
columns of the press that the Mexican
authorities have refused the admission
of arms since the late troubles in that
country. To further prevent any se
rious outbreaks by the Yaquis, Gov
ernor Kibbey some time ago issued a
proclamation forbidding the selling of
arms to Indians or aiding anybody in
sending arms into Mexico. Notwith
standing all these efforts, the opinion
seems to prevail in some quarters,
that the favored few, those who might
enjoy close relations with Mexican of
ficials, might import arms for the
protection of their property. Others
who reside in Arizona and like to take
occasional trips into Mexico to hunt
or prospect, have thought that if they
could secure a certificate of good
character from American officials,
they might be permitted to take their
arms across the line. These applica
tions have been taken to the court of
last resort, the president of Mexico,
and it has been definitely settled be
yond all peradventure of a doubt that,
when the Mexican authorities issued
those orders they knew exactly what
they were doing and meant every word
they said.

Sometime ago the representative of
a mining company in Sonora bought
a quantity of arms in this country
with which to protect his property. He
got the consignment as far as Nogales
but the customs officials stopped him
there. He presented himself to the
nearest consul and he in turn address
ed himself to the American embassy
in Mexico. In due course, the corres
pondence was turned over to the state
department together with copies of the
Mexican rulings affecting the case,
but the sum total of it was that Presi
dent Diaz said no, and that settled it.
In the course of the correspondence
the American embassy addressed it
self to the Mexican office for foreign
affairs and that office in turn ad
dressed itself to the Mexican treasury
department. In answer the following
letter was transmitted back along the
line until it reached the state depart
ment in Washington. Acting Secretary
of State Adee transmitted a copy of
the letter to Governor Kibbey, and it
arrived here yesterday. Following is
the text of it:
“Department of the Treasury to the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Very

The Third Captured for Madden at
Lexington Yesterday.

Lexington, Ky., Oct. 3. Siliko, the
bay son of Moko and Silicot, won the
$14,000 Kentucky futurity this after
noon at the Kentucky Trotting Horse
Breeders’ association track from the
best field of 3-year-olds that have
faced the starter this year. In winning
this, the blue ribbon event of the sea
son for 2-year-olds, Siliko defeated
Governor Francis, winner of the Clark
Horse Review futurity; The Abbe, win
ner of the Kentucky Stock Farm purse,
and Ed Custer.

arms and munitions through the cus
toms houses of the state of Sonora.
Several efforts have been made to im
port arms and munitions to said state
under permits obtained prior to the
prohibition and even after this, the
war department has issued new per
mits for the same purpose; but neither
the former nor the latter have been
successful by reason that the said
chief executive has issued orders mak
ing said prohibition absolute. Which
I have the honor to transmit to you
in reply to your courteous note No. 472
of this date. I renew to you my dis
tinguished consideration.
Mexico, September 11, 1906.

No victory in years was more pop
ular than that of the strong-hearted
son of Moko. In the third heat Ben
Stevens, who drove The Abbe, stepped
into the wheel of the sulky of Siliko.
In an instant Siliko tripped, throwing
McCarthy headlong beneath the hoofs
of The Abbe and in front of nine other
horses in the race.

A murmur of pity went up from the
spectators who witnessed the accident,
but this was changed to shouts of
amazement when McCarthy arose,
apparently unhurt. Siliko ran, driver
less, around the track into a harrow,
but was caught before he was injured.
McCarthy staggered back to the stand
to claim a foul against The Abbe.
Neither Siliko nor The Abbe finished
the heat.
The Abbe had stepped on McCarthy's
head, inflicting a painful and serious
injury. The Abbe was distanced for
fouling Siliko and the heat went to
Lightsome in a driving finish with Ed
Custer. The judge allowed Siliko to
start in the next heat, which he won,
with Myron McHenry in the sulky,
from Ed Custer by a neck and was
awarded the race.
He is owned by J. E. Madden, the
winner of three futurities—two Sheeps
head Bay futurities, with Ballyhoo Bey
and Yankee, and the trotting futurity
this afternoon with Siliko.
If the weather is favorable, Sweet
Marie, 2:02, will go for the world’s
record for trotters tomorrow.

“For months I had great trouble with my stomach
which grew worse and worse until I was unable to digest
hardly anything. I suffered from sour stomach, heart burn,
and a miserable restlessness. The result was that I be
came very weak and lost over twenty pounds in weight. I
was treated by two leading physicians in my city but got
no relief. I still kept worrying along and reading about
Cascarets, I finally tried them. In three months’ time I
regained my former weight and am now fully cured. I
feel that I owe my recovery entirely to Cascarets and would
recommend them to anyone suffering from the same trouble.”
