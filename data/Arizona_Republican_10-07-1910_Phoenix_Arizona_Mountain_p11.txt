AD

Too Late to
Classify

There was a time "within the remembrance of
man" when all the Tools sold during a month
from an ordinary hardware store could be clas
sified in a small space. Now the variety of
Tools that we carry is so great that it is impos
sible to list the kinds We sell.
It's "dead certain" our Assortment of Prices
should interest you.

W. H. Constable,

If what you just ate is souring on

your stomach or lies like a lump of

lead, refusing to digest, or you belch

Gas and Eructate sour, undigested food

or have a feeling of Dizziness, Heart

burn, Fullness, Nausea, Bad taste in

mouth and stomach headache this is

Indigestion.

A full case of Rape's Diapepsin costs

only 50 cents and will thoroughly cure
your out-of-order stomach, and leave

sufficient about the house in case some

one else in the family may suffer from

stomach trouble or Indigestion.

Ask your pharmacist to show you

the formula plainly printed on these
50-cent cases, then you will understand
why Dyspeptic trouble of all kinds

must go, and why they usually relieve

sour, out-of-order stomachs or Indi

gestion in five minutes. Diapepsin is

harmless and tastes like candy, though
each dose contains power sufficient to

digest and prepare for assimilation into

the blood all the food you eat; besides,
it makes you go to the table

with a healthy appetite; but, what will
please you most, is that you will feel

that your stomach and intestines are

clean and fresh, and you will not need

to resort to laxatives or liver pills for

Biliousness or Constipation.

This city will have many Diapepsin

cranks, as some people will call them,

but you will be cranky about this
splendid stomach preparation, too. If

you ever try a little for Indigestion or

Gastritis or any other Stomach misery-

Get some now, this minute, and for
ever rid yourself of Stomach Trouble

and Indigestion.

Address: TETLEY, MERRIMAN & CHILDS, PURCHASING AGENTS,

Indianapolis, Ind., Oct. 2. (Special

Correspondence to The Republican)

Dr. Nelson Brayton, son of Dr. A. V.

Brayton of this city, will leave
Indianapolis today in company with
Claud Maris, 2637 North Alabama

street, for a 2,000-mile overland auto
mobile trip to Phoenix, Ariz., where

Dr. Brayton is stationed in the gov
ernment service.

The machine will carry four extra

tires and an extra rear axle, and Dr.

Brayton expects to drive the 2,000

miles in twenty days. From Phoenix,
Maris will proceed to Los Angeles.
The route will take them through
St. Louis and Kansas City on the old
Santa Fe trail which they will follow
across the Rockies, going by way
of Raton Pass and, at one time,
reaching an altitude of 7,800 feet.
The trail will lead through Los
Vegas and Santa Fe, on to Albu
querque, N. M., where they will put
desert equipment on the car and pro
ceed with the hardest part of the

Journey over the desert.

The sand rivers of northern New

Mexico and Arizona will be the most
difficult portion of the trip. During
most of the year the rivers have no
water in them but they do have a

sand which is particularly difficult
for an automobile to get through. Dr.

Brayton, who recently came from
Phoenix for a visit with his parents

here, says that only one other auto
mobile ever went over the route which

they will follow on the trip. Every

other one that attempted it came to
grief in the sand.

It is a trick of this sand to twist

rear axles in two and it is for this
reason that the extra axle is being
taken. The rest of the desert equip

ment which they will take on at Al
buquerque will consist of a pick ax,
a shovel, a block and tackle and an
anchor, all to be used in getting the

machine out of the sand when it

sticks, pulling it forward to a point
whence it can be moved by its own

power. For miles and miles they

will travel through country where

there is no human inhabitant and

where there will be no water either
for them to drink or for the cooling
of their engine.

"The real romance of the automo

bile is fought out there on the des

erts and mountains of the southwest,"
said Dr. Brayton. "There is no part

of the country where a machine will
show its worth like it does out there.
Interest in automobiling has been
awakened in Phoenix by the annual
Los Angeles-Phoenix races, over the
Colorado Desert and Death Valley.
Last year this distance of 470 miles
was covered in nineteen hours and
forty minutes. For eighty miles of
the route no human habitation was
passed and there was no water, either
for the drivers or for the engine.
"A little earlier in the season the
trip is more dangerous than it is
now. It has not rained in that ter
ritory yet and it is still very dry, but
it is cooler. Earlier it is almost im
possible to carry water sufficient to
keep the engine cool and prevent the
cylinders from cracking, the tempera
ture running away above a hundred
in the shade.
"Phoenix," he continued, "is pos
sessed of a remarkable climate. In

its efficiency for the relief of tuber
culosis, it is surpassed by

no city in the world. The result
is that its winter population increases
to 25,000 or 30,000, while its summer
population is about 15,000. Its low
altitude—it is only 1,000 feet above
sea level—makes it possible for any
one to live there. There are many
cases where people have lived there
with tuberculosis for many years who
would have died in a few months in
an ordinary climate.
"An odd thing about the situation
there is, also, that in spite of the
great influx of tuberculosis suffer
ers, the native population is rarely

infected. Cases originating there are
extraordinarily rare in spite of the
constant opportunity of infection.
"My only regret is that I haven't
a man suffering of the disease to take

along with me on the trip. I would

like to take an invalid along to ob
serve the effect of the outdoor life

on the trip and to see the effect of

the Phoenix climate on him."
Dr. Brayton says that if he gets
through to Phoenix, he will soon
thereafter attempt a trip in his mach

ine, which he bought here, from Phoe
nix to the Grand Canyon of the Color

ado, a particularly difficult trip.

He will make the trip in an "E-M-

F."

EVERY LITTLE BIT ADDED
To your account in the savings
bank is a step towards
independence and comfort. So
when you open an account at
this bank, don't wait for big
amounts to add to it.
SMALL DEPOSITS
MADE OFTEN
Are more apt to mount up
quicker than larger ones made
less frequently. Can't you
guess why?
Union Bank &

Trust Co.

will have it in charge. This will be one of the most thorough campaigns
of the kind ever conducted in the
southwest. Every young man eligible
to membership will be interviewed.

The Sunday before the opening

there will be a sort of big jollification

in the building. All friends of the

Y. M. C. A. movement will meet to
celebrate the success of their long

and well-directed efforts.

Good results always follow the use

of Foley's Kidney Pills. They contain

just the ingredients necessary to tone,

strengthen and regulate the kidneys

and bladder, and to cure backache.

INFLAMED KIDNEYS

Medical writers declare it incurable

after the sixth month whether al
buminous or not.
The average man prefers to think of it
as "kidney trouble" and uses it go but the
census shows this appalling fact out
of 63,000 deaths from kidney troubles
the last census year over nine-tenths
of them (58,000) took the form called
"Bright's Disease" although it is quite
probable that nine-tenths of these up
to the last moment thought of it as
and called it "kidney trouble" when as
a matter of fact the only possible hope
lay through a specific for Bright's
Disease.
There never was one until Fulton
worked out his Renal emollient (Ful
ton's Renal Compound.)
Since then inflammation of the kid
neys whether albuminous or not or
whether called "kidney trouble" or
"Bright's Disease" or whether six
months or six years old commonly
yields.
If you have had kidney trouble over
six months no matter what you call it
it is the only hope. Efficiency 87 per
cent where patients do not wait until
bedridden although some of them re
cover. It can be had at druggists.
We desire to hear from and advise with
patients not noting the usual im
provement by the third bottle. Literature mailed free. Write John J. Ful

The Doctor's Question

Much Sickness Due to

Bowel Dis-

A doctor's first question when con

sulted by a patient is, "Are your bowels
regular?" He knows that 85 per cent
of illness is attended with inactive

bowels and torpid liver, and that this
condition must be removed gently and
thoroughly before health can be restored.

Rexall Orderlies are a positive,

pleasant and safe remedy for consti

pation and bowel disorders in general.

We are so certain of their great cura

tive value that we promise to return

the purchaser's money in every case
when they fail to produce entire satis

faction.

Rexall Orderlies are eaten like candy.

they act quietly, and have a soothing,

strengthening, healing influence on the
entire intestinal tract. They do not

purge, gripe, cause nausea, flatulence,

excessive looseness, diarrhea or other
annoying effect. They are especially

good for children, weak persons or old

folks. Two sizes, 25c. and 10c. Sold
