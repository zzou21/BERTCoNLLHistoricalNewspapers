STAGE DRIVERS

WILL FIGHT BOND ORDINANCE

That the jitney bus drivers on
Washington street and the Globe
Phoenix stage line owners will protest
against the city ordinance requiring
them to furnish a $2,000 bond
was a rumor yesterday that was verified
by O. B. Hall, secretary and
treasurer of the Salt River Stage line.
If the tentative plans of the automobile
men are carried out the matter
will unquestionably go into court.
The automobile stage and bus drivers
have organized and though they declare
they have not yet conferred with
their attorney as to what steps will
be taken, they have agreed to
operate.
"The ordinance is absurd on the
face of it," declared Mr. Hall. "It is an
unjust position. It will simply mean
that the jitney busses must go out of
business. We will protest on the grounds
that we are
not on the streets more than thirty
minutes a day and if our drivers are
capable of dodging the curves and
bluffs between here and Globe we believe
they are able to drive up Central
avenue without risking the lives
of their passengers. We are in the
city limits exactly fifteen minutes
going and coming, and it might be
that we could establish a terminal on
Van Buren street and so evade the
ordinance.
"We could maintain our town office
and still have the station beyond
the confine of the city authority. We
might leave our passengers there or
drive them in town as our guests.
"The idea of arguing that the bond
will insure the safety of the public
is ridiculous," continued Mr. Hall.
"From the spring of 1914 until the
spring of 1915 less than two per cent
of the accidents that occurred in Phoenix
were due to the jitney bus. The
city states that in San Francisco a
$10,000 bond is required, but does not
add that for a $20 premium that bond
can be secured. We can not get a
surety bond. We can not get a bond
under any consideration except a personal
or cash bond. As for the
licenses we pay a $10 a year license
in Phoenix. $20 in Mesa. $25 in Globe
and $25 in Miami. It is not a get
rich quick business."
In speaking of the rules laid down
by the corporation commission, Mr.
Hall stated that the automobile drivers
had readily co-operated.
"The regulations of the commission
were reasonable and have been complied
with to the letter. The filing of
rates and schedules is as it should be
and the dispensing of baggage and
trunks with passenger traffic has
worked admirably. Another good law
that the commission put into effect
was that no car should carry more
than the seating capacity given by
the manufacturers."
SEWING BEE The ladies of the
Presbyterian church will hold an all
day sewing bee in the church parlors
today. All are invited.
AMENDED COMPLAINT FILED
An amended complaint in the case of
Juan Carballo versus the Pay Consolidated
Copper company was filed yesterday
in the United States district
court.
MEET THIS EVENING The Young
Woman's Missionary society of the
First Baptist Church will hold their
first regular meeting this evening at
7:30 in the parlor rooms. All young
ladies of the church are invited to attend.
"SHORTY" DAVIS HERE Carroll
Davis, better known to the best people
of the state as "Shorty" is in town for
a few days from his home in Prescott.
Davis is a prominent cattleman and
automobile enthusiast of Yavapai and
Mohave counties.
ELIMINATION OF PAUL The
Republican has a penchant for puzzles.
Sometimes they can be solved and
sometimes they can't. This one they
guessed right. Take Hattie Paul and
Paul Dennis, cancel the two Pauls and
you have Hattie Dennis. A marriage
license was issued yesterday to Hattie
Paul and Paul Dennis, both of Chandler.
THEY LIKE HER Mrs. Edith Salisbury,
home economic specialist, who
is in the valley speaking to numerous
women's clubs on the subject of economizing
in the home, has been received
with open arms at the various places
she has spoken lately. At Palo Verde,
day before yesterday, 65 women turned
out to hear her. At Glendale there
were 50, and at a meeting on the south
side, there were a large number present.
KUNZELMAN'S GREAT PICTURE
One of the, if not the most remarkable
photographs ever taken in Arizona
is on exhibition in the lobby of the
Arizona theater today. It shows the
great Roosevelt dam pouring its flood
waters over the concrete spillways to
the river bed more than 228 feet below.
The picture is the work of Kunzelman,
the local outdoor photographer and
staff artist of The Republican. It is
3 feet six inches by four feet in
dimensions and is possibly the best piece
of outdoor work done by a local man
of the wonder project of Arizona. It
is being used to exploit the motion picture
of the dam which the local play
house is showing.

FRISCO REPORTER
Wires Republican About Disappearance
of Man Already Dead
Closed Incident Here.
A wild story probably growing out
of a query The Republican lately received
from a correspondent in San
Francisco was the cause of a wild rumor
circulating the death of Prosper Bordone.
It was stated in the query that
Bordone had disappeared in the red
light district; that a young man was
suspected of connection with his disappearance,
and how much did The
Republican want of the story. The telegraph
editor replied that the death of
Bordone was a closed incident as all
the circumstances of his death were
well known.
He died at the county hospital here
after an illness of some years. For the
last three years he had been practically
helpless, and not long before his death,
all his means having vanished, he was
removed to the poor house. The San
Francisco mystery related to a man of
the same name.
Though Bordone died a pauper, it is
not long since he was possessed of considerable
wealth. It is said that his
income was about $1,000 a month at
one time within the last 10 years. How
his property became dissipated is not
known.
LITERARY SOCIETY The Murphy

mother. They would like any kind of
housework or laundry.
MORE SCHOOL MONEY Governor
Hunt yesterday received a check
for the sum of $2,226.34 from the United

public lands of this state, the sale
of which benefits the public school
funds. The check will be turned over
to State Treasurer Simms, and will be
credited to the permanent common
school fund. These checks come once
a year from the federal government.

Tax Commissioner C. M. Zander, who

to get to Nogales in spite of all the

He went via Florence and from there

Campbell, who is also on the program
at the same meeting, will reach the

PIPE DREAM

GEORGE J. OLNEY

Word from Graham County states that
Whole County Strong for Candidate
for Governor
Since the announcement in The
Republican several weeks ago, that
George A. Olney, would probably enter
the democratic primaries as a candidate
for governor, several newspapers
of the state have commented upon his
candidacy.
In speaking of Mr. Olney's past record
yesterday, a prominent politician
from Graham county, Mr. Olney's former
home had the following to say:
"Years ago, when Graham county
possessed probably more bad men than
any other section of the United States,
George Olney was sheriff of that county
for four years. It required a man
of courage, iron nerve and unerring
judgment to fill the position. At that
time, Graham and Greenlee were one
county."
The last issue of the Copper Era,
published at Clifton Greenlee county
contained the following editorial comment
on Mr. Olney's candidacy:
"Press dispatches from Phoenix continue
to bring the information that
Hon. Geo. A. Olney will be a candidate
for governor in the democratic primaries.
Assuming these advices to be correct,
it is a foregone conclusion that a host
of democrats will flock to his
standard. George Olney has at various
times during the past twenty-five
years held official positions and his administration
of the official duties devolving
upon him have been marked by universal
fairness to all classes, a strict
adherence to the law and unquestioned
honesty, free from bias and prejudice.
To fully appreciate George Olney one
must know him personally and that is
why his old friends in Greenlee and
Graham counties are enthusiastic over
his candidacy. He is a democrat from
the Texas school (than whom there are
none better) a man of sterling worth,
and a man with a keen insight into
state and county administration affairs.
With a democrat like George
Olney at the head of the state administration
we opine the taxpayers would
witness a big reduction during the next
two years in the cost of the state government."

SPECIAL NOTICE

OF POULTRY AID
Poultry Breeders to Meet in Called
Session, Special Program to
Be Rendered
A special meeting of the Arizona
Poultry Association is to be held tomorrow
afternoon at the Chamber of
Commerce. The program announced
for the February meeting will be carried
out at this called meeting instead.
This will be the last opportunity to
join in time to have members name
listed in the President's Directory of the
1916 Year Book, soon to be issued from
the Republican job office.
The Year Book was something new
for state associations, and was much
appreciated by those who as members
received the benefit of the publicity.
Favorable comment of the Poultry
Journals throughout the United States
gave the Poultry Breeders and the
state considerable publicity last year,
and the members of the association
were unanimous in deciding to publish
the 1916 annual.
The program at the Saturday meeting
will be particularly good. Mrs. Jay
Stannard of Phoenix, will tell how she
makes a success of raising turkeys.
Wm. Prawner, also of Phoenix, will
give his reasons for preferring the
White Orpingtons over all other fowls.
Edgar Lee Earron of Mesa, whose
ducks won first prize at Madison
Square Garden and San Francisco, will
have for his subject "Ducks and Other
Water Fowl."
In addition the committee appointed
to make a report on the matter of
marketing eggs, and the cold storage
problem, will report and this report
will be of interest to every farmer and
egg producer in the valley.
WENT TO TEMPE Prof. C. O.
Case, who yesterday afternoon started
to drive his car over to Tempe to attend
a meeting of the board of regents
of the normal, reported that there was
quite an overplus of mud on the road
between the two cities, and at one
place, the mire was so deep, that Mr.
Case had to have his machine pulled
out of the mud by a pair of mules.
ROAD IS MAKING MONEY According
to a report of the finances of
the Ray & Gila Valley railroad, which
has been filed in the office of the state
corporation commission, the road is
making money. The receipts, for the
month of November just past were
$11,711, as against the sum of $10,734
taken during the same month of 1914.
FILES NEW REPLY BRIEF Assistant
Attorney General Harben yesterday
filed in the state supreme court
a supplemental reply brief in the case
of W. J. Sturgeon vs. state of Arizona,
this being the "Personal use" case
which has been hanging fire for some
time. The issue involved in the case
is whether a man can bring liquor into
the state provided it is intended for
personal use. The case came from
Yuma county.
