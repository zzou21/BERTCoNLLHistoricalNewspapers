Wall Street.
New York, June 14. There is a
further shrinkage in the volume of the
stock market today following the
tendency of last week. Efforts of the
organized speculative element to effect
profit-taking sales to take advantage of
any outside demand at the week-end
influences forced a decline after the opening
dividend to the meager proportions
the outside demand. The entire un-
responsiveness of the general market
and the impressive and value in United
States Steel proved a striking feature
for the day's transactions. The depreciation of United States Steel was
most persistent and aggressive buying for home and London account. Heavy
ins from both sources was considered
important and as due to influential
financial interests. The highest price
attained before today was 199 1/4. As the one-half per cent
quarterly dividend came off the stock
just last week, today's price of 193 1/2 exceeds the previous record by
that much additional.
Aside from the impression made by
the buying itself and the differences
drawn from it, there was nothing de-
veloped concerning property to account
for the strength of United States Steel.
The introduction of it to the Paris
market came into renewed discussion
and it was urged that the beginning
of active trading in the stock in Paris
might be made the occasion for
a bull market demonstration. Among
them, animated paper passed from under
the depression which has held it for
several days and moved upward in
spite of another decline in London and
unfavorable opinions on the trade po-
sition reported from Paris.
Paris gave over the active selling of
coppers which it has been following
in connection with the speculation
with African gold mines which has
engaged the attention of Paris opera-
tors.
Union Pacific made some show of
strength but Southern Pacific was
heavy helping to the confusion of
speculative sentiment.
The new impetus to the United
States Steel movement was contrary
to the heralded promise. Outside of
United States Steel the most conspicuous
stock in the day's dealings was
Wabash, preferred.
The great expansion which the loan
item of the banks is showing was
much discussed but interior and foreign credits remain so quiet that opinion on the money situation was re-
assured. Closing stocks.
