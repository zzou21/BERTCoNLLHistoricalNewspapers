THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN: SATURDAY MORNING, AUGUST 5, 1893.

Mesa Department.

MESA CITY, ARIZONA, AUGUST 5, 1893.

Fruit Shipping.
Lately attention has
been
turned more into the direction of fruit
raising. A variety of
fruits and other fruits to grow for this
industry. Heretofore a farmer or so
called fruit grower endeavored to get
his little vineyard or orchard just as
many varieties as possible. That is all
very well for our local peddlers, but
when it comes to fruit shipping, suffi­
cient of each variety must be had if
any success is to be obtained. Then
the question is what varieties shall we
plant to fill this demand. California
has in the past and is now conceded to
be the "grape country" of the
United States, and today that industry
is far in advance in quantity over any
other section of the country. But
Arizona, Salt River valley, is rapidly
coming to the front, in this product
particularly. Our climate is much bet­
ter adapted to their growing and pre­
serving, and our soil and atmosphere
ripens them from two to four weeks
earlier. For an early grape here, as
there, the Sweetwater and Seedless are
perhaps the best, the latter however is
more of a home grape and used for
home preserving.
The next grape that ripens and is a
shipper is the Lady Downing which is
much larger and juicier than in Cali­
fornia, and of course comes earlier than
there. But by far the best shipper of
any is the Black Monier grape that has
been ripening here for the last two
weeks. The Black Monier grape also
grows better here than in the Golden
State, and is a better shipper, sells
better, and will demand a bigger price
than any other grape and furthermore
is a sure crop. Wellington Richins of
Mesa, has a patch of these grapes, and
when one is tasted and he says they
have not had an off year since he
planted, and will grow with less water
than any other grapes. The Rose of
Peru, the Emperor and the Flaming
Tokay are also good growers and
shippers. L. B. Johnson of Mesa, has
been engaged in the fruit business this
spring and has shipped over 7,500
pounds of grapes, and has realized
from 5 to 7½ cents per pound, net­
ting him about $250 per hundred.

MESA NOTES.
Mr. M. V. Lee paid Mesa a visit on
business Thursday.
Mr. E. D. Andre of Phoenix, paid
Mesa a pleasant call yesterday.
Mr. W. M. Dixon will start to the
mine today with a load of provisions.
Mr. Rex Lucy came up to Mesa on
the stage on business yesterday morn­
ing.
C. Hockett came up to the city
from his ranch southwest of Mesa yes­
terday.
P. Berkenkamp of Tempe, but
who has a large butcher shop in
Mesa, the Pomeroy block, was in
town yesterday.
Trippel & Son, engineers of Mesa,
started the official survey of Mesa
City yesterday. Our streets and blocks
are now laid off in regulation form.
Mesa City presented a busy appear­
ance yesterday morning and from the
traffic traded on her streets one could eas­
ily imagine himself in a metropolitan
city.
Mr. Henry Duke arrived yesterday
from Casa Grande where he had been
with a load of fruit. He reports that
not much rain fell in that direction,
although he was caught in a slight
rain Wednesday.
Two four horse loads of ore from the
Mammoth mine passed through Mesa
this morning for Tempe, from where it
will be shipped to Denver. This will
nearly finish loading the third car
shipped from this mine and the net
receipts are startling.
A very heavy and refreshing shower
passed over Mesa yesterday, starting
about 5 o’clock and continued for a
couple of hours. The rainfall, four
inches, was heavier than any this
spring or summer. The path of the
storm was but three miles wide and
came from the northeast, covering the
mesa with a sheet of water.
A lady desiring to do general house­
work in either city, country or mines,
can be found at Theodore Sirrine’s,
Main St., Mesa City.

CHANGES IN EXTRADITION LAW.

In Early Modern Times Political Refugees
Were the Only Ones Sought.

It is a remarkable fact that in the
early cases in modern history it was
always for political offenses that sur­
render was claimed, though at present
it is almost the only ground of refusal,
says Chambers’ Journal. But such an
offense does not mean a crime commit­
ted from political motives, but one
committed during a time of civil war
or open insurrection. The French gov­
ernment in 1880 refused to extradite
Hartmann, who was suspected of plan­
ning the plot against the czar at Mos­
cow in December, 1879. When the
Swiss government in November, 1890,
demanded the extradition of one Cas­
sani, who had shot a member of the
ministry, the English judge gave him
the benefit of this exception in the
trial. Charles II., as is well known,
pursued some of the murderers of his
father with relentless hate, and in 1661
concluded a treaty in Denmark in
which the latter agreed to deliver up
on requisition all persons who had
been concerned in the murder of
Charles I.
The states general of Holland sur­
rendered some of the regicides without
treaty stipulations; but in 1663 they
refused to give up any persons excepted
from the English act of indemnity and
pardoned persons demanded by the
English government. James II. put
his treaty in force while Burnet, then
minister of Burnet, not yet a bishop,
was acting as private secretary to the
Prince of Orange. As related in his
“History of His Own Time,” he states
that the king’s principal
cause of anger against him was a re­
port of his intended marriage to a
wealthy lady at The Hague, and pro­
ceedings were set on foot in Scotland.
Burnet, however, got wind of the mat­
ter before the news of it reached d’Al­
beville, then English ambassador, and
petitioned for naturalization, which
was readily granted. When the am­
bassador demanded his banishment,
Burnet claimed protection of the states
as a naturalized subject. The demand
was subsequently repeated in more
forcible terms, but the states refused
to surrender him.

No Poetry.
Wife—That new gown of mine is a
perfect poem, isn’t it?
Husband (who writes)—No, it isn’t.
I’ve been trying for an hour to make
passementerie, or furbelow, or bouf­
fant, or some of those other words in
the bill, rhyme with dollars, and I
can’t do it to save my neck.
