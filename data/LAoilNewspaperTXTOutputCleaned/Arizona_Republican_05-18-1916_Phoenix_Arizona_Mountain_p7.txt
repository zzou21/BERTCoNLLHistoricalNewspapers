Gov. de la Huerta Will Be
Asked to Send Greetings
to Governor Hunt by Motor
cycle; Tom Shaughnessy
Enthuses Over Plan

To harmonize states of Sonora,
remove differences in competition,
as set out by Dr. Boido, the relation
and Arizona.

In the heat of sport is the plan worked
out of this city in answer to Sonora's repeated offers of
cooperation. A five hundred mile mo-
torcycle pace, starting at Hermosillo,
capital of Sonora and ending at the
State fair grounds next fall, is the
means which the noted motorcycle
race promoter advances to demon-
strate the pacification of Sonora, its
freedom from that turmoil that has
kept most of Mexico in a state of
war, and its readiness to accept the
world's best efforts to develop the
miraculous resources of that state.
With the definite promise of co-
operation by Consul Ives G. Lievier,
who was in Phoenix to confer with
the pardon board Tuesday, Dr. Boido
yesterday made his plan known to
Secretary Wm. Shaughnessy of the fair. The result was
enthusiasm and the promise of every
possible aid.
Briefly, the plan is this: Having se-
cured the promise of the fair, the
chamber of commerce and allied in-
terests of support and having received
the sanction of the governor of this
state, Dr. Boido will visit Civil Gov-
ernor Adolph de la Huerta at Douglas, possibly this month. Sailor Le!e rter, who hailed the scheme with sat-
isfaction, as the solution of the difficulties in the way of better
relations between the people of Sono-
ra and those of Arizona, assured the
promoter that de la Huerta would un-
doubtedly be delighted.
After having brought the parties to-
gether, the promoter will institute a
campaign of publicity, enlisting the
interest of the entire United States in
the resumption of friendly relations
between the Americans and Mexicans
of the two states. It is pointed out
that when Cananea used to be the
scene of numerous baseball and box-
ing encounters, and the people had
an opportunity to mingle and risk a
peso or two on the results, there was
no lack of cordiality resulting from
differences of opinion. Paradoxical,
but true. The wholesome results of
baseball in the Philippines and in Ni-
caragua and the Canal Zone, have
proven how completely animosity can
be dissolved in warm interest over
sports.
From Hermosillo to Nogales, there
is a 235 mile automobile road over
which Senor J. L. Clavier declares the race
can be run in fast time. From No-
gales to Phoenix, the route will be
by way of Tucson and Florence.
"As the plan grows," declared Dr.
Boido yesterday. "Far from being a
mere motorcycle race, even though a
very ambitious one, it begins to look
like a new phase in international di-
plomacy. I am in close touch with
Sonora and Sonorans. I know the
spirit that exists there, and while it is
necessarily more or less resentful to-
ward the United States, it is not im-
possible to change it. Mexicans are,
after all, a sport-loving people. They
have but recently become familiar with
the automobile and motorcycle. I
would like to see Governor de la Huerta
write copies of a letter of greeting
to Governor Hunt, hand on to each
entrant in the race, and let

Local Ball Tossers Going to Tempe
and Endeavor to Bring in Another
Scalp for Collection

Tempe, which is located in the Salt
River Valley, adjacent to Phoenix,
has been starving for some real
games of ball for many moons. The
town has boasted a team of more or
less ability for all that time, but
no proper stamping grounds has been
provided for the athletes.
Through the efforts of a number of
public-spirited citizens, the lack of a
diamond has been remedied, and now
the residents of Tempe are getting
ready to turn out in force Sunday af-
ternoon and see the Bears play the
outlaws of Phoenix.
The two teams have clashed once
before in Phoenix. At that time they
played on what has been termed the
"Polk street" diamond, which is
more like a goat's paradise than a
ball grounds. The Tempe team was
not satisfied with the showing they
made, and have been demanding re-
venge with a loud and piteous wail.
They are about to have their heart's
desires gratified. In spite of the fact
that the local team has won the last
five games played, the Tempe outfit
is positive that they have a machine
fixed up which with due care and an
eye to eventualities will take the
measure of the Outlaws. Phoenix after an animated session of
Johnny Baggiore, in spite of the kill-
ing fact that it causes a brain storm to
spell his last name, is counted upon to do the hauling stunt for the Out-
laws. Johnny has lately returned to
Phoenix after an animated session of
the Mexican brigands, and feels that a
mere hunch of Tempe ball players will
cause him little trouble.
The outlaw's manager has gathered
a bunch of real sluggers, and unless he
falls down in his predictions, his team
is going to show up some real batting
Sunday. The game will be called at 2:30.
