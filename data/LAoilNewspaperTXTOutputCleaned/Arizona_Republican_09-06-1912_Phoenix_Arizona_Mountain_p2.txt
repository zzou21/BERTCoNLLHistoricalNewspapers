TEMPE
NORMAL OPENS
ON NEXT MONDAY
Everything Points to an Unusually
Large Attendance.

The largest attendance that has
ever previously presented itself in
Tempe for enrollment in any educa
tional institution will be witnessed
next Monday at the Tempe Normal
School. Last year's enrollment at the
end of the year was two hundred and
seventy-five, but it is thought the
number will easily reach the three
hundred mark the coming week. And
that is just the first week of school.
Students come straggling in quite fre
quently for at least a month to come,
and following that, off and on all
year.

It has been requested by President
Matthews of the institution that all
local students, at least those who can
possibly find it convenient, call at
the school some time tomorrow and
secure their classification blanks. Mr.
Matthews and an assistant will be in
his office the entire day so that one
may call at any time up to six p. m.
The reason for this early appearance
is to relieve the pressure Monday
when so many new students will have
come in prepared to enter the school.
Monday will be given over to the
classifying of the new students, that
is, those who did not make arrange
ments on the day of previous regis
tration.

It is thought that with this mode of
procedure that everybody will be in
readiness for the real opening of
school on Tuesday morning. Assem
bly will be called at the usual time,
nine o'clock, and possibly there will be
short addresses by members of the
faculty. At the conclusion of that the
regular recitations of the day will be
made, although each will cut a little
short to allow for examinations. Ev
ery new student entering from the
eighth grade or any high school will
be given an examination immediately
following the routine work of the en
tire student body. Without a classi
fication slip one will not be able to
enter any class in the institution.
Therefore, it can be seen that it will
be very necessary to secure those
blanks as early as possible.

Up to yesterday morning every
room in the girls’ dormitory had been
taken and there were but three places
left where a young lady can be cared
for. The boys’ dormitory is also un
usually well filled. It is not likely,
though, that any one will be turned
down on account of lack of quarters.
Some new arrangements will be made
if the occasion demands it.

U. A. Smith, Bridgeton, Ind., had
kidney trouble for years, and was so
crippled with rheumatism he could
not dress without help. He started
using Foley Kidney Pills, and says:
“I began to get better at once, and
now all my trouble has left me and I
do not feel that I ever had rheuma
tism. I rest well all night and,
though 59 years old, can now do the
work of a man of 35 years. I would
like to be the means of others getting
benefit from Foley Kidney Pills.” Re
fuse substitutes. For sale by Elvey
& Hulett, Phoenix.

A GANG PLOW.
One of the greatest implements of
work ever tried on a farm in this
vicinity has been put on trial at the
Drace Jepsen ranch for the past few
days. The machine is a gang plow
tearing up a piece of ground nine feet
and four inches wide every time it
moves. The machine is being oper
ated at present by Pete Ryan, who has
the agency for the complete struc
ture. It is drawn by a gasoline en
gine. Originally the machine was
composed of two parts, an equal num
ber of plows forming each portion, but
with the ground they are now operat
ing in it was found impossible to use
but one of them. Despite that fact,
though, the plow is doing exceptional
ly good work and no doubt will prove
a great success on Tempe farms.

MEETING OF FARMERS CALLED.
A meeting of all south side farmers
interested in the drainage system
which is being talked of has been
called for next Saturday afternoon at
two o’clock in the office of the Tem
pe Canal Company. A meeting was
held about the first of July at which
a committee was appointed to draw
up plans and make an estimate on the
cost of building. This committee has
finished its work and will make as
full a report as possible at the coming
meeting. It is thought that some
thing in the way of active operations
will be definitely decided upon.

AUCTION SALE CONTINUED.
The Arizona Mercantile Company of
this city announces that the remain
der of its high-grade furnishing stock
will be sold at auction tomorrow at
their place of business on Mill avenue.
The doors will be opened at nine
o'clock in the morning and will re
main so until everything is sold. For
anyone looking for bargains this is
the place on Saturday.

FOR SALE—Good quality Bartlett
pears. Henness ranch, southwest of
Tempe.

SHOW A SUCCESS.
The final appearance of the James
T. Kelley Musical Comedy Company at
this place on last Wednesday even
ing was a complete success from start
to finish. Owing to a mistake by the
moving picture exchange in Phoenix
the two reels of motion pictures
which were to have been shown in
connection with the farce did not ar
rive. However, the humorists of the
company made up for it and gave the
people twice their money’s worth.
The name of the play staged Wednes
day evening was “The Wrong Widow”
and every portion of it certainly lived
up to its title. Every person in the
company, with the exception of one,
was involved in the presentation of
the laughable farce. Business man
ager of the company, Dick Eckles,
said on the eve of their final show
that the company, with an addition of
two members, will again pay Tempe a
visit, probably within the next two
weeks. No doubt they will be liber
ally patronized too, for everybody
seemed to be fully pleased over all
three plays staged during their stay
in this place.

Mrs. J. N. Hill, Homer, Ga., has used
Foley’s Honey and Tar Compound for
years, and says she always recom
mends it to her friends. “It never
fails to cure our coughs and colds and
prevents croup. We have five child
ren and always give them Foley’s
Honey and Tar Compound for a cold,
and they are all soon well. We would
not be without it in our house.” For
sale by Elvey & Hulett, Phoenix.

SECURED POSITION.
Charles Pickrell, a member of the
1911 graduating class of the Normal,
left yesterday for Phoenix on his way
to Ash Fork, where he has secured a
position as teacher in the city school
at that place during the coming year.

TO ATTEND SCHOOL.
A. R. Spikes, a normal student, came
in yesterday morning from Douglas to
prepare for school.

ON BUSINESS.
Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Ware of Mesa
spent yesterday forenoon in Tempe
making arrangements for a suit
able location for their children who
plan to enter the Normal.

RETURN TO WORK.
Misses Leona and Mary Haulot
came in yesterday morning from
their summer’s vacation in anticipa
tion of the opening of the schools.
The latter is a new teacher in the
public school.

FROM THE UNIVERSITY.
Prof. R. H. Forbes of the State Uni
versity of Tucson was a visitor in
Tempe over Tuesday night.

OLD TIMER ANSWERS
THE FINAL SUMMONS
Death of Don C. Babbitt, One of
the Pioneers of Arizona, at
His Home in Mesa.

At six o’clock yesterday morning
Don C. Babbitt died at his home in
the southwest part of town, from kid
ney trouble. He had been ill during
the past six months. The funeral
services will be held at ten o’clock
this morning from the family home.
Don C. Babbitt was born sixty-nine
years ago in Macedonia, Illinois, and
at an early age was taken by his
father to Utah. He was married in
that state and afterward moved to
Arizona, settling at St. Johns in
Apache county. While residing there
he engaged in the newspaper busi
ness. Twenty-one years ago he and
his family came to Mesa and have
since resided on their home place
here continuously. He owned some
farm land and devoted considerable
attention to truck gardening, in which
he was very successful.

Mr. Babbitt left a faithful wife
and seven daughters to mourn his
death. One daughter resides in Ore
gon, Mrs. Sadie Horn; the others
live in Mesa and vicinity. The daugh
ters are Mrs. Ellis Brizzee, Mrs.
Ettena Lewis, wife of Dudley S.
Lewis; Mrs. Grace Nicols, Mrs. Ruth
Horne, Mrs. Rose Standage. The lat
ter has for some time past resided
with her parents at their home in
Mesa. Three sons were born to Mr.
and Mrs. Babbitt, but all three died
in infancy. A brother, Almon W.
Babbitt, resides in Mesa and a sister,
Mrs. Nancy Riggs, lives at St. Johns.
Mr. Babbitt was a son of Hon. Al
mon W. Babbitt, one of the pioneer
Mormons of Utah and at one time
high in the councils of Brigham
Young.

Don C. Babbitt was highly respect
ed by all who knew him, for his
sterling qualities of honesty, indus
try and good citizenship. His death
is a loss to the community as well
as those to whom he was bound
by ties of kinship and deep affection.

T. L. Parks, Murrayville, Ga., Route
1, is in his 73d year and was recently
cured of a bad kidney and bladder
trouble. He says himself: “I have
suffered with my kidneys. My back
ached and I was annoyed with bladder
irregularities. I can truthfully say,
one 50c bottle of Foley Kidney Pills
cured me entirely.” They contain no
habit-forming drugs. For sale by El
vey & Hulett, Phoenix.

ALLIED BOARDS
Announcements have been received
calling the next meeting of the
Allied Boards of Trade of Maricopa
County, September 7th (Saturday), at
the office of A. Neilsen, Tempe, at
2 o’clock p.m. President Dougherty
of the Mesa Commercial Club will
designate the delegates from the local
organization.

Antoine Deloria, Postmaster at Gar
den, Mich., knows the exact facts
when he speaks of the curative value
of Foley Kidney Pills. He says:
“From my own experience I recom
mended Foley Kidney Pills as a great
remedy for kidney disease, and a good
many of my neighbors were cured by
Foley Kidney Pills.” For sale by El
vey & Hulett, Phoenix.

HIS CAPITAL
A young man writing to the Mesa
Commercial Club from one of the
far eastern states, asks: “Can a
young man with $1000 capital and an
assured income of $100 per month,
a good wife and baby and plenty of
energy and ambition, succeed in the
Mesa country?”

A young man with the assets set
forth in the letter should certainly
be able to succeed in any country.
A young man with a good wife and
plenty of energy and ambition ought
to be able to succeed, if he had only
$100, to say nothing of a thousand
and an income beside. Many of the
young men of Mesa would think they
were on “easy street” if they had
the “good wife” together with good
health and a fair field; the extra
thousand dollars would look like a
fortune.

TRIAL DAY
Today will be a busy one in the
Mesa justice court. At ten o’clock the
case against W. A. Tway, on com
plaint of Charles Davis, will be heard.
District Attorney Lyman will appear
for the state and Silverthorn & Sex
ton will defend. A jury will debate
the question at issue, which grew out
of a dispute over a ditch.

Immediately following this case the
cases against P. J. Schaefer, Louis
Cuber, John R. Williams and Elmer
Coleman will be heard. The four men
are charged with violation of the lo
cal option law. The district attorney
will prosecute and M. J. Dougherty
defend. There was an impression in
the minds of some that the town
was prosecuting, which is a mistake.
There is no town ordinance govern
ing the sale of intoxicants in a local
option district. The men named in
the complaints conduct pool halls and
sell cigars and soft drinks, including
what is known as “two per cent.”
For this they pay a license to the
town, and so long as they do not run
disorderly houses, or violate the ordi
nances, the town has no authority to
act. The charge of violating the local
option law was made by D. L.
Hughes, of Tucson, and the sheriff’s
office is supposed to take the proper
steps toward enforcing the law if
complaint is made to the officials.
The district attorney is the legal
prosecutor of all such offenses. Any
citizen, however, has the right, and
it is part of a good citizen’s duty,
to furnish information and file com
plaints if he or she has knowledge
of offenses against the law and has
the evidence to back up the informa
tion.

MANY DRIVEN FROM HOME.
Every year, in many parts of the
country, thousands are driven from
their homes by coughs and lung
diseases. Friends and business are
left behind for other climates, but
this is costly and not always sure.
A better way—the way of multitudes—
is to use Dr. King’s New Discovery
and cure yourself at home. Stay right
there, with your friends, and take
this safe medicine. Throat and lung
troubles find quick relief and health
returns. Its help in coughs, colds,
grip, croup, whooping cough and sore
lungs make it a positive blessing.
50c and $1.00. Trial bottle free. Guar
anteed by all druggists.

VAUDEVILLE
The Coliseum management cele
brated the release of the children
from quarantine by putting on a
vaudeville show last night. The en
gagement of the James T. Kelley
Musical Farce Comedy Company also
includes tonight and tomorrow night.
Last night the bill was “A Cherry Blos
som,” tonight “The Doin’s of Dooley”
will amuse the audience and tomor
row night the engagement will close
with “The Wrong Widow.” Mr. Kel
ley’s company is said to be one of
the best now playing the summer
theaters. Besides Mr. Kelley, the com
pany is composed of Patrick Raf
ferty, Con Forbes, R. L. Eakle, Miss
Queenie Duffy, Miss Marie Gordon
and Miss Hazel Stone. Manager Men
hennett bids fair to make quite a
hit with the new company.

THE MEN WHO SUCCEED
as heads of large enterprises are men
of great energy. Success today de
mands health. To fail is to fail. It's
utter folly for a man to endure a
weak, run-down, half-alive condition
when Electric Bitters will put him
right on his feet in short order. “Four
bottles did me more real good than
any other medicine I ever took,”
writes Chas. B. Allen, Sylvania, Ga.
“After years of suffering with rheu
matism, liver trouble, stomach disor
ders and deranged kidneys, I am
again, thanks to Electric Bitters,
sound and well.” Try them. Only
50c.

MACCABEE LADIES
The Ladies of the Maccabees will

have been universally successful in
their dances and entertainments and
will no doubt be equally so in the
forthcoming event.

A YOUNG BANKER

BURNED BY LIVE WIRE
Shortly before 4 o’clock yesterday
afternoon Dan Wilson, aged about
sixty-five, came in contact with the
high-powered transmission line in
front of the Ed Tway residence 2½
miles east of town and was badly
shocked.

At first it was thought the man
was dead and the coroner was noti
fied, but before he had left town
word came that there was some life
in the victim. Dr. R. F. Palmer had
been notified and went to the scene
of the accident at once. The latest
report indicated that while the man
was badly injured he would recover.

The accident occurred while Wilson
was driving a team attached to a
stacker, and in attempting to cross
under the wire the top of the stacker
came in contact with the transmission
line.

$80,000,000.00 LOST ANNUALLY BY
WAGE EARNERS.
Dr. Sadler estimates that about
$80,000,000.00 in wages is lost annually

sult of colds. Lost time means lost
wages and doctoring is expensive. Use
Foley’s Honey and Tar Compound

Two charming effects are shown

shown on the other figure is made of
a wide piece of satin ribbon shirred
over heavy cords and finished at each
end with a beaded rosette of rib

THE PASTOR’S NEW TELEPHONE
His Announcement of a Hymn Sounded Like a Call.
An admiring parishioner of a young

a telephone installed in the clergy
man’s house. The good man was de

used it immediately before going to
church.
When the time came for him to
announce the first hymn, he read
the first lines with his usual im
pressiveness, and concluded with:
“Let us all unite in hymn seven O
three.” —Lippincott’s Magazine.
