HOMESTEAD LAW

Measure Permitting Patents
in Three Years Does Not
Apply Under Reclamation
Projects; Consideration of
Bill to That End

J. J. Gould of the Greene & Griffin
office, in the interest of settlers in this
valley, sent a telegram to Representa
tive Carl Hayden, asking him whether
the new law providing for the proving
up of homestead claims in three years,
would apply to homestead entries un
der the Roosevelt project and also
whether it applied to homestead entries
made prior to the enactment of the
law. Yesterday Mr. Gould received the
following reply:
Washington, D. C., June 11, 1912.
Mr. J. J. Gould,
Phoenix, Arizona.
The three year homestead law ap
plies to entries made prior to its pass
age, but does not benefit lands under
reclamation project. A bill providing
for patents on reclamation homesteads
was favorably reported from my com
mittee yesterday and we hope to pass
it this session.
CARL HAYDEN.

MAY BE BIG TREES IN 2012.
The forest service is raising sev
eral acres of big tree seedlings on the
Tahoe national forest in California,
at a more northerly point than at any
natural big tree grove. While the gi
ant sequoias are found in the forests
of the Sierras at various points
throughout a total range of some
250 miles, in the northern two-thirds
of this range there is practically no
natural reproduction. It has conse
quently been a question whether the
big tree could be re-established be
yond the present range. The foresters
are making the experiment not with
the intention of establishing a forest
but of testing the adaptability of the
species for growth in localities much
north of any of its present strong
holds. The grove furthest north, a
few scattering trees, is located on
Eldorado national forest in latitude
about 38 degrees north, while the new
plantation is being started on the
Tahoe forest in latitude about 39½,
just over the Nevada line. Although
only about sixty miles north, this new
site is at a very much lower altitude
than the parent big tree forests, being
at about 2700 feet above sea level.
The first seeding was done in the fall
of 1910, with very successful results,
and last fall an additional area is
seeded.
The method used in planting the
seed was that known to the forest
foresters as the seed spot method.
Spots about six feet apart each way
were prepared by pulverizing the
earth with a garden hoe, then drop
ping seed on these spots and lightly
pressing in the soil with the foot. The
flourishing condition of the young
seedlings gives good reason to expect
a future grove of big trees at this
point. With protection of forests from
fire there seems to be no reason why
the big trees should disappear, even
though scientists regard them as sur
vivals from a past age, botanically
speaking.

EFFECTS OF SPARING THE ROD.

Comment has often been made in
these columns on the state of practical
anarchy often reached in elementary
schools in consequence of the abolition
of corporal punishment. Now the high
school teachers have taken up the sub
ject. They do not go so far as to ad
vocate the restoration of the rod, in
high schools at least, but they insist
that there is no such thing as discipline
in the schools and that pupils are los
ing the moral value which comes from
learning strict obedience to orders.
They propose to get such discipline in
the high schools by a vigorous use of
detention as a punishment for infrac
tions of discipline, and possibly for
high school children that may be
enough. But the discipline in the high
schools would be simple enough if the
children had learned to mind promptly
in the lower grades. As the great bulk
of children never reach the high school,
they go out into the world as rampant
young anarchists, without any whole
some respect for constituted authority.
There is no doubt that corporal pun
ishment has been abused in schools in
the past, and there is no doubt that
the power to thrash a boy ought to be
taken from a teacher who has come
into collision with the boy, and whose
temper or vindictiveness may have
been aroused. But the harm of severe
flogging was confined to the very few
boys who were brutally beaten. One
such case served to arouse a whole
town, and the resultant criticism made
other teachers cautious in their meth
ods of whipping, so that the abuses of
corporal punishment were very few.
The lack of discipline and the contempt
for authority which come from the
abolition of the rod are pervasive. They
affect most of the children in every
classroom which has two or three un
ruly boys, and the result is the gen
eral spirit of lawlessness which we see
upon the streets and in the cars. It Is
gravely doubtful whether this wide
spread recklessness among the chil
dren is not a more serious injury to
the community than the excessive pun
ishment of a boy here and there was.
The criminologists tell us that we
make most of our crime between the
years of 9 and 12, that the inmates of
reformatories are mostly under 18 or
20, and those of our prisons under 30.
Under the law all of our children go to
school. The boy who gets his induction
into criminal ways under 12 or 14 gets
them while he is in some school. Nine
times out of ten he gets it because the
principal is not able to expel some
older boy who is a source of contami
nation, nor is he allowed to thrash the
older boy into good behavior. If some
statistician will compile the public
school records of the young offenders
who get into jail, and then principals
will tell frankly the conditions under
which those boys learned to go wrong,
we shall get needed light on the sub
ject of school discipline. After we get
the light we may be ready to welcome
more disciples of Solomon on our board
of education. Brooklyn Eagle.
