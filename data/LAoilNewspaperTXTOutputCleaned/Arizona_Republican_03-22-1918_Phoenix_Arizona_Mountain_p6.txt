represent the state in this great cause,"
writes Major General F. S. Strong,
commanding the 40th division, national
army, Camp Kearny, to Governor W.
P. Hunt. The letter is in reply to one
written by the governor since returning
from his visit to Camp Kearny.
The full text of the letter reads:
"I cannot tell you how much your
good letter of March 14 is appreciated.
I shall pass it on to the officers of the
158th infantry.
Your visits to the camp have been
an inspiration to the men. It has con
vinced them that their friends at home
are back of them and take a personal
interest in their welfare. You can ap
preciate how much that means to men,
who are giving their lives to the cause.
"You and the citizens of Arizona may
well be proud of the men sent here to
represent the state in this great crisis."

UTAH AGGIES SPORT

Republican A.P. Leased Wire

BOULDER, Colo., March 21 The
Utah Aggies basketball team defeated
the University of Colorado, 31 to 19
here tonight in the first of a series of
three games for the championship of
the Rocky Mountain inter-collegiate
conference. The Utah players were too
fast for the Colorado team and the
outcome of the game never was in
doubt. Colorado did not score one goal
from the field during the first half.

HIELMAN BREAKS

William Hielman, who has the dis-
tinction of securing the longest jail
sentence of any man in Maricopa, ap
pears to have small knowledge of the
laws of Arizona. The liquor law is not
the only one Hielman has broken, for
since his confinement in the county
jail, he has again violated law and
order. He probably is not aware that
pugilistic encounters are not tolerated,
for yesterday he staged a neat little
affair in the sheriff's office.
When his attorney, Marcus A. Wood
ward, asked to see Hielman, he was
privileged to have the conference in the
office of the sheriff. Immediately upon
his entrance, Hielman asked his coun
sel to "come through" with certain
funds, insinuating that he had not done
what he had set out to do. Upon
Woodward's refusal, Hielman gave up
argument and resorted to his fists and
was still exercising when the doors of
his cell closed upon him.
Woodward it is understood was en
gaged by Hielman's father to bring
certain matters to the attention of the
board of pardons and paroles. He is
alleged to have stated that he meant
to carry on the case for Hielman and
that if there was any money to be re
turned it would go to the man by whom
he was employed and not to his son.

The following resolution was adopted
by Phoenix Lodge No. 335, B. P. O.
Elks, last evening:
Whereas, Phoenix Lodge No. 335, B.
P. O. E., has now in the service of the
United States in the war with the em
pire of Germany and its allies, several
of its members, and
Whereas, the Benevolent and Protec
tive Order of Elks is essentially a
patriotic order, and
Whereas, we believe that the good
name and reputation of those who serve
in the present war be maintained, and
Whereas it is claimed by certain
newspapers that certain Arizona boys
now in the army of the United States
at Camp Kearny were guilty of in
discretion, which indiscretion, how
ever, if true, is exploited and magni
fied by certain newspapers of the state
of Arizona to the detriment of the
reputation of our soldiers:
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
Phoenix Lodge No. 335, B. P. O. E. that
we regret and deplore the notoriety ac
corded by certain newspapers to such
acts or indiscretion, if true.
Furthermore, it is the sense of this
lodge that such indiscretions, even if
true, should be overlooked and not ac
corded space in newspapers to the end
that the reputation of those who are
now sacrificing themselves and who
may be called upon to sacrifice their
very lives for their country may not be
further besmirched and to this end re
quest the newspapers to desist from
further mentioning the incident.
By the adoption of this resolution
we do not, however, desire to be under
stood as condoning the act of any per
son who may have been a party to such
indiscretion.
(Publicity given by the newspapers
to this has not been detrimental to the
boys but the persons who have been
hurt by it are the civilians who par
ticipated. The publicity is the kind
these civilians have deserved because
of their acts. Three weeks, about, has
elapsed since the incident alluded to
and the newspapers have shown great
forebearance in delaying this al-
lusion to the affair. The Editor.

THE DAIRY
As A Business Proposition
Survey blanks summarized to date show the
following:
Average acres per farm 83
Average number of cows 32
Average value per cow $97.93
Average cost of operation $5505.00
Average returns $3200.00
Average loss per farm $1305.00
In a statement of November 26, the Food Administration
says:
"The farmer received for the 1916 harvest between $1.45 and
$1.50 per bushel for the harvest, taking the country by large
and. Last year he received under 20 per cent of the
price of the loaf. Today he is receiving over 40 per cent of
the money paid for the cash loaf, this being the result of
the stabilization of prices in this industry."
Why shouldn't the dairy industry, the produce of which is
as essential as wheat, be fostered in the same manner?

BEES ARE WILD ANIMALS

(Kansas City Journal)
Bees are declared to be wild ani
mals, according to a jury in the
Wyandotte county court. W. T. HoJ
land was acquitted on a charge of
grand larceny, as it was shown to
the satisfaction of the jury that the
bees swarmed to his place.
Holland rented a farm from J. C.
Hume, on which there were 11 hives
of bees. When Holland left there
were 16 hives and he took five of
them. Hume accused him of taking
them unlawfully. The attorney for
Holland was able to prove that bees
were wild animals and won the case.
