The Hon. Jared Y. Sanders, gov
ernor of Louisiana, who has just had
himself elected United States Sen
ator by the legislature of his state,
is forty-one years old and the un
questioned political boss of the
Louisiana democracy. Exception in
dependence of spirit, Sanders is in
no respects like the late Senator
McEnery. It was his influence which
defeated the federal income tax
amendment
in the Louisiana legisla
ture recently, and for this reason
his name will go on Mr. Bryan's black
list.

PHOENIX, ARIZ., JULY 12, 1910.

The Hotel This Week.

The stockholders of the new Adams
hotel company acted with good busi
ness judgment at their meeting yes
terday. They determined to raise
the remainder of the required cap
ital by Friday of this week, and
they resolved in favor of a fireproof
building if it be found that the cost
of construction will not exceed two
hundred thousand dollars.
Of the proposed sum of $250,000
for the new hotel, there remains to
be raised but $20,000, and this amount
should easily be found by the sub
scription committees within the next
three days. It is not a donation
proposition, in any sense. Investors
can safely count on annual dividends
of at least 20 per cent, and there
are many people in Phoenix and the
valley who would be glad to place
their money in a 20-per-cent invest
ment. Wise from every standpoint was
the decision to build a fireproof hotel
if possible. Everybody concedes that
the city could have no better ad
vertisement than a first-class, fire
proof hotel, and the stockholders can
well afford to pay the difference in
cost of construction. (We think,
however, that it will be found that
the difference is not great.) For
traveling men the attraction of a
fireproof hotel is such that they will
so arrange their schedules that they
will always come to Phoenix for Sun
days and other stop-over days, when
practicable; and for tourists gener
ally Phoenix will have an immense
advantage over every other city in
Arizona if it offers the only fire
proof hotel in the territory. Another
consideration for the stockholders,
which alone should control in favor
of a fireproof hotel, is the fact that
if the new Adams is constructed of
reinforced concrete the hotel will, in
all probability, have no rival for
many years to come. It will be most
fortunate for the city and for the
stockholders if it is found that such
a structure as is required can be
built of fireproof material for
$200,000.

Most important of all, however, is
the decision to make the hotel project
a success by Friday of this week.

The death of Joseph Thomas, in
New Jersey the other day called
public attention to his remarkable
career as an inventor. Among the
many profitable devices that orig
inated with him were the feeder and
oscillator for sewing machines which
made the Singer machine a success;
the first machine for making sulphur
matches, the wire hoop skirt, and
many minor inventions. Like many
other inventive geniuses, he had no
"financial ability," and got little rev
enue from his inventions, although
they made fortunes for others.

Some of the local democratic poli
ticians are willing to join the re
publicans in naming a bi-partisan
delegation to the constitutional con
vention "provided that the republi
cans will agree to name delegates
who are in favor of the initiative and
referendum." Thanks, awfully. We
more than suspect that not even the
democratic convention will declare
for this latest Bryanite fad.

The sad announcement made some
months ago, that the Pacific Mail
company would sell its ships and re
tire from business if the ship subsidy
bill failed, seems to have been of the
nature vulgarly described as bluff.
The subsidy bill did not pass, and
the dispatches bring the news that
the Pacific Mail has just ordered
two new steamers.

A Poet on the Bench.

The supreme court of Missouri has
won distinction of many sorts, some
times, to the grief of the Missourians
especially when, straining at gnats,
that august tribunal has turned crim
inals loose in its worship of tech
nicality. Nobody, however, can com
plain of one of its latest decisions,
which places it on a high literary
pedestal. In the case of Kries vs.
Missouri Pacific Railroad Company,
reported in the 148th volume of the
Missouri reports, and set forth in the
Southwestern Reporter, in an opinion
handed down by Mr. Justice Sher
wood, we find a certificate of char
acter for the orb of day which in
poetic feeling ranks with Chantecleer’s
apostrophe to “The Sun.” But let
us quote Judge Sherwood without
further comment:
“But counsel for plaintiff, while en
deavoring to establish that the path
occasionally ran upon the ties, surely
forgot one of his most important wit
nesses—a witness that could not be
approached; a witness who could not
be subpoenaed, although his deposition
might be taken. That deposition has
been taken in photograph No. 2, and
that witness—the unimpeachable sun.
His deposition, taken in indelible
characters of heavenly light, repro
duces the surroundings of the scene
of the accident, the tracks, the space
between them, the pathway, and the
end of the ties, as they existed at
the time of the injury. That deposi
tion establishes that the eye, though
aided by an instrument, can discover
in that sun-painted picture no place
where the path runs upon the end
of the ties, or touches them; nor is
any point discoverable where the ties
are imbedded in earth or cinders, or
are even with the surrounding sur
face. They stand out in bold relief,
and can be seen and counted. And
to me it is a very comforting thought
and pleasing reflection that amid all
the vicissitudes and pressing exig
encies of railroad damage suits they
have never yet attempted to impeach
Old Sol. Perhaps they were deterred
by his shining reputation. At any
rate, from his serene seat in the
heavens, ‘from his cairn on high,’ he
still looks down upon the pygmy
populations of earth with the same
burning eye wherewithal erstwhile he
gazed down upon Ananias that time
he went in before the Apostles, and
‘lied to the Holy Ghost.’ Such solar
testimony as this, which bears truth’s
own impress upon it, gives full sanc
tion and corroboration to the state
ments.”

According to the democratic press
of Tennessee, that state is in “immi
nent danger” of going republican this
fall. Infinitely worse things could
happen to Tennessee.

“Even Johnson has rights!” ex
claims the Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle. “Well, he asserted them
on the Fourth, didn’t he?”

Arizona Lodge No. 2 F. & A.
M., will confer the Third De
gree this evening.
