THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN: THURSDAY MORNING, JULY 20, 1893.

3

Mesa Department.

MESA CITY, ARIZONA, JULY 20, 1893.

MESA NOTES.
Mr. Rosenberger drove in from his
assessment of Moan this morning.
Mr. Rosin...
He comes to the city on business from
Amines today. He has had charge
of Patterson Bros.’ store there.

Mr. C. Allen came up from Tanque this
morning. He states that one carload of lumber ar-
rived yesterday for the Salt company.
Mr. J. V. Shillinglaw and son, of
Pocahontas, Hamilton Co., Iowa, are in
Mesa at present and have invested in
property near the city.
Mr. J. H. Bonds came down from the
ranch last night and with his family
and Mr. Sonera and family went up the
river for a few days’ outing.
Mr. F. W. Crouse, ex-Indian agent of
the Gila, and vice-president of the Mesa
Bank, with his family, came over
and will reside permanently.
H. Pomeroy, Capt. McCluskey,
Mr. Netherton and Frank Miller,
started for the Superstition mountains
this morning. They will be gone two
or three days.
Mr. Thalheimer opened his beer hall
here yesterday and celebrated the oc-
casion by setting them up to the boys.
Mr. F. E. Falconer has charge of the
beer hall at present.
Mr. J. L. Patterson came down from
Amines this morning. He has been
very sick for the last week and was not
expected to live for a short time, but
rallied and was driven home, where he
will receive better care.
A 1,000 inch raise was reported in
the river last night, and the canals are
being filled with water. The farmers
and fruit growers should take advant-
age of this increased supply and get
their ground well soaked.
W. Pomeroy came down from the
mines on this morning’s stage. He re-
ports times lively there. He brought
down some very rich rock taken from a
mine he located a few days ago. He
has men sinking a shaft on the
“streak.”
Mr. Bush passed through Mesa today
en route to Tempe with an eight-horse
team loaded with ore from the Mam-
moth mine. This load will fill the sec-
ond car ready, each car holding 85,000
pounds.
J. L. LeBaron, Sons & Co., have
shipped about 4,000 pounds of Mesa’s
early grapes to New Mexico and other
points of the Sweetwater, Lady Downs
and Muscat varieties. The earliest
variety, the Sweetwater, are just ripen-
ing in California and we had them
two weeks.
Quite a dust storm accompanied with
a little rain passed over Mesa yesterday
evening and although the wind was not
very heavy yet caused considerable
stir to circulate round the Mexican
circus tent as those industrious indi-
viduals struggled in vain to keep it from be-
ing torn to shreds.
One of the most pleasing events of
the season will occur this evening at the
church, when Mrs. Eaton of Mesa will
give an entertainment. Mrs. Eaton is
a splendid elocutionist and the public
in coming out will receive a treat.
Misses Warren and Long of Mesa, with
other local talent, will assist in making
the occasion one of long remembrance.
The new addition to the Mesa Co-op.
building is almost finished down-stairs, and
a few more days will witness the fitting
up of counters and shelving and stock-
ing the store. There will be three de-
partments, dry goods, grocery and
hardware, which will no doubt get the
bulk of the business of Mesa and
vicinity. The prosperity of this busi-
ness, the Zenos Co-op., has been proved
in the past, starting with compara-
tively nothing under the careful man-
agement of George Passey it has for
the first three years paid a big dividend
each year, and last year a dividend of
50 per cent was paid its stockholders
and the capital stock doubled. The
business demanded more room and the
large addition was put on. Last spring
Mr. Passey started in business for him-
self and W. J. LeBaron was chosen to
take charge and no doubt the success in
the future will be greater than in the
past.

SHE CAPTURED THE COURT.
A Woman Traveler Who Can Take Care
of Herself.

“There are several lady travelers on
the road, but most of them are rather
‘peddlers’ than travelers,” writes a com-
mercial traveler to the St. Louis Globe-
Democrat. “One of the brightest among them
that I have met was a pleasant little
lady who was taking orders for books,
though as she frequently explained, she
was not a book agent, because she only
sold to the trade and in ‘quantities.’
So it might be, but she always kept a
‘spar copy’ to accommodate anyone
who might be struck with its beauties.
I met her in a small Illinois town,
where the city had lately passed
an ordinance to collect a license from every
person who came within a hundred miles
of the city being an agent or peddler, and my
fair comrade got herself arrested for
selling a single copy of her book for six
dollars, cash, to a man who was mean
enough to give her away. I felt sorry
for her and made up my mind that
after supper I would either square the
case or bail her out.
My efforts to enlist sympathy in her
favor were not needed, for at supper
time she appeared more radiant than
ever. I asked her how she got along
with the police judge or justice of the
peace.
‘Oh, splendid,’ she replied, ‘he’s the benevo-
lent old man I ever saw in my life.
He bought the only copy I had left,
and I asked the constable who arrested
me if he thought he had good sense to
go back and arrest him then for
buying.’
I often wonder what kind of argu-
ment the lady uses, for the old judge

had a reputation for cussedness which
it was hard to equal. But one thing is
certain, and that is the average woman
traveler can take good care of herself
without much outside assistance.”

EUROPEAN NOBLEWOMEN.
Queen Anne, of England, was ex-
tremely fond of brandy, and her face
became so bloated that among the pop-
ulace she was known as “Brandy-Faced
Nan.”
The dowager duchess of Sutherland
was lately committed to prison for six
weeks on sentence for contempt of
court. She had burned some papers
used in evidence in a trial concerning
her husband’s will.
The Princess of Wales has, perhaps,
invented almost as many novelties as
those in the knickknack trade. She
drew with her own hand the plan for
the pocket smoking case which the
Prince carries everywhere with him.
H. F. Johnson, Sons & Co., have just
received a large and well selected stock
of men’s, boys’ and ladies’ shoes.

low prices.
