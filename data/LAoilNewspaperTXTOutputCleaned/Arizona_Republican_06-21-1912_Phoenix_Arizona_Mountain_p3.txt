HAYDEN, June 20. Dr. Ira K.
Brown who looks after the surgical and
medical end of things for the Ray Cons.
and A. S. & R. and operates several
hospitals at Ray, Kelvin and Hayden
was in town the early part of the week
looking over plans, under consideration
for the erection of Hayden's new hos
pital proposed for the near future.
When completed this will be one of the
noteworthy institutions of the town.
Karl Hatch of the Taylor-Hatch
company has just returned from an
extended visit to points in the southern
part of the state and northern Mexico.
Frank M. Tool of the Kelvin Lum
ber Co. has just returned from a sev
eral day's hunting and fishing trip in
the Catalina mountains where he en
joyed a much-needed rest.
A. V. Babey of the Gila Valley Bank
is enjoying an unusual streak of good
luck. A few days ago he secured a
fine horse and buggy. Now with his
bank position and a fine turn-out there
is no reason why "Bill" should not cut
quite a dash.
Mrs. C. C. Nichols and her sister,
Miss Marmala Fellows left Wednesday
for Tempe. After a short stay in the
Salt River valley they expect to go to
the coast for the balance of the sum
mer. H. M. Martin returned to Hayden
Wednesday after an extended trip to
New York and other eastern points.
Mr. Martin is electrical engineer for
the A. S. & R. Co. and also owner of
the National Theater here. He enjoys
the reputation of being a "live one"
and Haydenites are looking for some
thing interesting in the show line in
the near future.
MAKES PIMPLES GO
Remarkable How Zemo Clears the
Face of Pimples and All Other
Blemishes.
With the finger tips apply a little
Zemo to the skin, then see the pim
ples and blackheads vanish. Zemo is
a liquid, not a smear, leaves no trace,
just simply sinks in and does the
work. You will be astonished to find
how quickly eczema, rash, dandruff,
itch, liver spots, salt rheum and all
other liver diseases are cured.
Zemo is put up by the E. W. Rose
Medicine Co., St. Louis, Mo., and is
regularly sold by all druggists at $1
for the large bottles, but you can
get a liberal size trial bottle for only
25 cents. And this trial bottle is
guaranteed. You surely will find
Zemo a wonder. Get a bottle now
from Elvey & Hulcett's Drug Store.

BIG JOY DAY
FOR CLERKS

Coming Thursday Holidays
Will Be Reminders of
Greatest Events in East
lake's History; List of
Prizes and Winners
The clerk picknickers almost too full
for words, streamed out of Eastlake
Park yesterday evening after a day of
glee topped by a close score ball game
and spreading to their homes carried the
tired but happy remembrance of the
best time they ever accumulated in
one afternoon's outing.
The stir commenced soon after mid
day when crowds began to collect on
the down town corners. The Indian
school band arrived with their joyous
noise and the frolicsome clerks started
impromptu parades headed by banners
and flags, when the picnic reached the
park, the stewards who had been over
worked all morning preparing the re
past dealt out huge supplies of re
freshments of every hot weather va
riety; and so well prepared were they
to handle the demand that the good
things did not run out until the last
holiday seeker was satisfied several
times over. It would take an arith
metic shark to figure just how many
sandwiches, ice cream and lemonade
were consumed.
The hosts distinguished by ribbons,
organized the races and contests about
two o'clock. Perspiring but happy
competitors began to mow down the
lists of prizes in the most enthusiastic
manner. Ladies as well as other eager
ones from small boys to very much
grown men straddled along the dif
ferent courses or entered contests of
skill and capacity until you or anybody
else couldn't rest; no one was there to
rest anyway.
Phoenix and Tempe ball teams en
tered the diamond and fought stubborn
ly through nine innings of that brand
of baseball best described by the score
2 to 1. That epic is recited elsewhere.
And when they had run out of ma
terial for more jollification everybody
decided they had been doing it enough
and the crowds boarded a car for town
fully realizing that the day had been
wrung dry of all its possible amuse
ment. Here is a list of the prizes for which
the strivers kicked up the dust of the
race course and shed gallons of per
spiration in an endeavor to get
ahead of the other fellow.
50 yd. foot race for boys, suit from
Goldbergs, won by Sam Drew.
Fat man's race 1st prize Manhattan
shirt from The Hub won by O'Dan
iel. 2nd prize Box cigars from Frank
Connelly, won by Fred. Krauch.

Edith Hagmoir. 2d prize hand painted
vase from Nickel store, won by Miss
Bessie Peck.

gars from Baswitz Cigar Co., won by
Frank Shedd.

trousers from McDougal & Cassou, won
by Mr. Williams.
Fat Ladies race One "Ham what am" from Armour's, won by Mrs. Helen
Guillum.

won by Raymond Scott.
Pitcher for the winning baseball
team 1/2 doz. Holeproof hose from Hy
der Bros., won by Smiley.
o
A STORY BY SENATOR LEA.
Senator Luke Lea of Tennessee tells
this story:
A political 'spellbinder' was denouncing
his opponents when a member of the
maligned party arose and started for
the door.
"He had moved a few steps down the
main aisle when the speaker said:
" 'That gentleman who is just going out reminds me of a little story.'
" 'A negro woman,' said the speaker,
'once upon a time attended a sleight-of-hand
performance, and was apparently greatly delighted with the con
jurer's tricks until, spreading a news
paper upon the table and placing a
heavy blanket over it, the man of magic
proceeded to read the newspaper.
" 'Fo' de Lawd's sake!' exclaimed
Dinah, 'Miss ain't no place for a woman
in a thin calico dress!'"

THINGS TIED UP IN SENATE

(Continued from Page One.)
But Wood and Davis were prepared
for the fight with a little bombshell
which they had kept carefully con
cealed until the proper time arrived.
That time came when the bill was
open for amendments. Then Davis
arose and offered a substitute which
was nothing more nor less than a
provision for submitting an amend
ment to the constitution giving to
women the right of suffrage.
It was funny. The look of con
sternation that overspread the faces
of the Yavapai contingent would have
made the fortune of any artist in the
world if he could have caught it. In
explanation of the bill Senator Wood
said he is not much in favor of
amending the constitution; and he is
not losing any sleep over the woman
suffrage proposition. "But if we are
going to amend the constitution," he
said, "why don't we amend it in ac
cordance with the popular demand?
Is there any demand for striking out
the emergency clause of the constitu
tion? Has anybody been asked to
introduce such an amendment? Have
any petitions come in here asking for
such an amendment? Where is the
demand? Who is making it?
"Now, we all know there is a de
mand for the submission of a suffrage
amendment. Various petitions have
been filed in the office of the secre
tary of state. We know a consider
able proportion of the people of this
state want that amendment that
there is an honest demand for. As I
said before, I am not anxious to have
the constitution amended; but I sub
mit if we are going to amend it at
all we ought to amend it in accord
ance with the demands of the people.
The object of the amendment that
has been offered here seems to be
to restore certain gentlemen to the
favor of their constituents. But I
want to ask, in all fairness, is that
sufficient reason why we should sub
mit an amendment and throw the
burden of this expense upon the peo
ple of the state?"
Wood didn't "name names" in his
remarks but it really looked, when he
said there was no excuse for the pro
posed amendment and that somebody
was trying to patch up the constitu
tion to aid his own political fortunes,
it really looked as though he was
talking directly to the senators from
Yavapai. And the senators from
Yavapai seemed to take it that way,
too.
It was several anxious minutes be
fore the scene was ended. Davis said
the proposed amendment should be
entitled to act "to restrain the legis
lature from doing what it has already
done."
Senator Hughes took the floor and
spoke energetically and pointedly in
favor of the substitute amendment,
the woman suffrage proposition. And
then finally it dawned upon the ad
vocates of the "McKinney" amendment
that the suffrage substitute was not
germane to the original proposition
and that point was raised. The sub
stitute was tabled by a vote of eight
to seven.
Then somebody wanted to know un
der what call the "McKinney" amend
ment comes, but nobody was able to
answer the question. Cunniff was asked to
rule it out of order on the ground
that it comes under no section of the
call, but the senate took the matter
out of his hands and sent the bill to
the enrolling and engrossing commit
tee also by the vote of eight to seven.
The first business in the senate
yesterday morning was the reception
of several messages from the house.
One reported non-concurrence on
the canvassing board bill, another
non-concurrence on the primary bill.
The committee named above was then
appointed with instructions to insist
on the senate amendments.
Then the "McKinney" constitutional
amendment bill came up and the
question was raised whether it should
be considered at once. This proposi
tion was rejected and it went to the
style and revision committee.
The bill exempting churches and
lodges from the operation of the cor
poration registration bill was reported
from conference with slight amend
ments. The report of the committee
was adopted. The rules were sus
pended, it went to second and third
reading and was adopted.
The report of the conference com
mittee on the registration bill was
adopted and the bill was passed.
The church and lodge registration
fee bill was then reconsidered for the
purpose of attaching an emergency
clause. The bill was then passed
again.
A new bill was introduced by C. B.
Wood. This bill provides that the
statute shall be so amended that the
publication of auditor's warrants shall
hereafter be dispensed with. Mr.
Wood explained that under the new
law full publicity will be given by the
publication of the treasurer's state
ments and that the publication of the
auditor's warrants in addition would
be a needless expense. The bill was
read and passed under suspension of
the rules, the whole operation taking
nine minutes.
The enactment of this law will save
the state $200 a month. But there
was a bit of cruelty in passing it
just at this time because the chief
adviser to the governor, who also is
chief beneficiary under the law as it
stands is in Los Angeles and unable
to protect his "interests."
There was also a bill by Homer
Wood. This is a bill appropriating
$5000 to pay for the publication of
initiative and referendum petitions
and proposed constitutional amend
ments. It was approved also.
Not much time was spent by the
house in actual session today but
several of its members were quite
busy in working in conference on bills
already mentioned. However the con
current resolution relating to the pay
of legislative employes was passed and
the senate bill providing for the cre
ation of boards of deposit to look
after the state's funds was sent to
committee. Also the bill providing
pay for the territorial canvassing
board was sent to a new conference
committee and the board of control
bill was given second and third read
ings and was passed.
The vote on the eminent domain bill

was reconsidered and the house re
ported it had not concurred in the
senate's amendments.
Two new bills were introduced in
the house yesterday, one providing
for the sale of the journal and an
other making an appropriation to pay
the canvassing board which shall do
duty at the next election. Both these
bills were read the first time and re
ferred to committees.
Bills just signed by the governor
are as follows:
The bill making an appropriation
for the state auditor's office.
The bill relating to franchises for
public service corporations.
The general corporation bill.
The board of control bill.
The bill fixing the salaries of chap
lains at the state penitentiary.
The bank comptroller bill.
The tax levy bill.
The bill fixing the salary of the
assistant secretary of state.
The pure food bill.
The bill fixing the powers and duties
of the juvenile court.
The state engineer bill.
o
APPOINTMENT OF COBB
AS STATE ENGINEER
But This Created Surprise In No
Quarter.
With the passage of the bill creating
the office of state engineer Governor
Hunt lost no time in appointing Bamar Cobb to the position. This
appointment had been long discount
ed and while it probably will not ap
peal particularly to some of the more
"progressive" among the democrats it
will quite certainly be one of the most
popular appointments Mr. Hunt has yet made.
Cobb is a resident of Clifton and a
native of Georgia. He was a mem
ber of the constitutional convention
where he made a record by opposing
some of the particularly radical no
tions brought to the front by the so
cialistic element of the democrats.
Then last fall he entered the race for
the congressional nomination and
while there was no thought from the
first that he could be nominated he
surprised everybody by the strength
of his support.

"But don't you think this bathing
suit somewhat er a trifle im
modest?" "I don't know. That is what all the
fashionable people are wearing this

overcome my modesty, but I never
can overcome the handicap of being
unfashionable." Detroit Free Press.

THE EMPRESS
"The Bandits" are as gay a bunch
of thieves as ever gathered in Ari
zona, Mexico or little old New York,
and they manage among them to get
all the money in the crowd. One
of the finest scenes of the Roosevelt
dam ever painted, is used as a drop
curtain at the rear of the stage. The
tale is of Harry Murphy who visits
the southwestern country and is
finally about to be thrown into jail
for a board bill. Harry learns that
his father has come into the land
of the Senor to search for him, and
he and the landlord, Senor Gonzales,
fix up a scheme by which the amount
$77.72 is secured from the old man.
The comedy is very funny and keeps
the entire audience laughing. This
is the first time that Joe Lurigo has
been assigned a consequential speak
ing part and he acquitted himself
with decided credit. The special song
hits are "Baggy Rag," "In Old Ma
drid," "Carry Marry Harry," "Senora,"
"Honna Lula Hula" and "Son of the
Desert." The latter, sung by Mr.
Beach is one of the prettiest songs
that has been sung during the en
gagement of the company here. The
same bill will be repeated tomorrow
evening. The next comedy will be of
the Reuben variety, quite different
from anything played so far.
THE COLISEUM
Manager Reeves has decided that
the children should be encouraged in
their efforts to aid their elders in
exterminating that pest the fly. In
pursuance of this idea he has offered
a free ticket to every child to wit
ness the performance at the Coliseum
Friday night, if he will come to the
box office of the theater with the
proper credentials 50 dead flies. A
fly swatter will be presented free to
all children.
The show this week is the best one
seen at the Coliseum for some weeks
consisting of a clever sketching act
by Hon and Marshall; a musical
number by Regala and Germaine and
a dancing act by McGee and Recce.

"Lulu's Anarchist." Lulu Beach
stenographer, is a great reader of
dime novels. One day, when she is
reading a terrible tale of anarchists,
a foreign-looking man enters the of
fice and asks to see her employer,
who is out. He hands her a card,
and strange enough it bears the same
name as the anarchist in her novel
and she at once imagines him a
nihilist. He is joined by a friend,
and together they rent the next of
fice. That night she confides her
suspicions to Tom, a "cub reporter,"
who is an admirer of her. It hap
pens that Lulu's employer goes away
for a day or two. This is her chance.
She locks the door and looks through
the transom into the next office. She
sees Max make up in several char
acters for the benefit of Tyler, who
is watching him, and taking from his
valise what she imagines to be a
bomb. She is so excited she falls off
the chair. She 'phones to Tom, her
reporter friend. Tom tells his editor
he is on the track of a great story,
and with three policemen arrives at
the office, only to find that Max
Mornisky is a rapid-change artist un
der Tyler's management and was giv
ing him an exhibition of his wonder
ful act. Tom starts in and upbraids
Lulu and she weeps, but Tyler tells
Tom he can get a good story out of
it anyway. He writes it up and
makes a hit.
You will see this at the Savoy to
