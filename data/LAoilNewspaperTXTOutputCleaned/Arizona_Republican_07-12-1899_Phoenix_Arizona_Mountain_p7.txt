IN QUAINT OLD RENNES
The Little Brittany Town That Has
Suddenly Sprung Into Prominence.
A month ago, outside of France,
Rennes was scarcely known. When the
American colony making the annual
summer exit from Paris the day after
the Grand Prix, bound for Dinard, the
Newport of France, scarcely noted the
shouting of “the guard as the train
drew up before a railway station:
‘Rennes! Rennes!’
Now thousands of people are rushing
to Rennes; the hotels are taxed
beyond the limits; prices hitherto un-
heard of are current. The attention of
the world is fixed upon this Breton
town where Dreyfus’ retrial is to take
place.
Brittany is the one province of
France which has escaped modern
civilization. In Brittany the old
songs are strong, the legends linger in
the hearts of the people. Women sit
in the doorways plying the distaff, and
the quaint Breton Angelus is sung in the
little churches. The saints are per-
petually honored, and the annual par-
ish fete, called in Brittany a “pardon,”
is faithfully observed. The Breton
peasant still wears the traditional
coiffe; her costume is always that of
her ancestors.
Rennes, today numbering 70,000 in-
habitants, was the capital of the Redones
of Caesar’s time. A Latin
tablet inscription on one of the an-
cient gates, the stone now placed in the
museum, informs the tourist that Ren-
nes was patronized by the Emperor
Jovian, “very august, very happy,
and very pious.”
Rennes shared with Nantes the honor
of being the most important of the
towns of Brittany in the middle ages.
In fact, an intense rivalry existed be-
tween these chief cities. Rennes con-
quered in the end and became the res-
idence of the Breton princes of the day.
For centuries the Breton parliament
assembled at Rennes, and whenever
the reigning prince died the new Duke
of Brittany presented himself at the
gates of Rennes to demand of the city
the ducal crown and make a solemn
oath to maintain the rights of the Bre-
ton nation. Of this epoch in the ex-
istence of Rennes many traces remain.
We still find in the old quarters ancient
buildings typical of that middle ages
appendage of balconies, galleries, tow-
ers, zigzagging roofs and dormer win-
dows, each story projecting beyond the
lower, the windows of the upper al-
leys meeting its neighbor over the
way, so that two persons might con-
verse in whispers from opposite houses.
That such opportunities were not al-
lowed to pass unimproved by the Ro-
meos and Juliets of that day some of
the ancient ballads lead us to believe.

served to destroy much of the ancient
Rennes. This fire raged for ten days,
and one by one the ancient buildings
toppled into the cauldron. The clock
tower, built upon the ruins of a rudely
built pagan temple, disappeared in the
flames. That part of the city which
replaced the burning district forms the
modern portion of the city.
Under the reign of Louis XIV Brit-
tany was ruled by a provincial gover-
nor. The letters of Mme. de Sevigne
furnish descriptions of the embarrass-
ments which resulted from this admin-
istration. From these letters we know
that no small amount of splendor sur-
rounded the office of governor of the
province. She describes a visit paid
her at her chateau, Les Rochers, by
this functionary “with twenty gentle-
men in his cortege, not to mention
trumpeters and guards.”
The revolt of the Bretons against
exorbitant taxation furnishes a dra-
matic page in French history. It re-
quired 6,000 troops to chastise the 2,000
or 3,000 Bretons who had risen in protest.
The palace of justice of today,
where Dreyfus will be tried, was form-
erly the parliament building. Its first
stone was laid in 1618, at the close of
the protracted contest between Nantes
and Rennes.
Besides the palace of justice, Rennes
possesses a university of note, a ca-
thedral, museum and botanical gard-
ens, all interesting and worth the
journey from Paris to visit. Especially
interesting is the fact that Rennes is
an important military point. Two
corps of artillery, the Seventh and
Tenth, six regiments of infantry
are stationed here and there are sev-
eral armories. From a Paris Letter.

ONLY PRIEST IN CONGRESS
Was Father Gabriel Richard and
Came Direct From a Prison Cell.
Father George T. Heldmann’s candi-
dacy for congress in the Chicago dis-
trict recalls the fact that only one
Catholic priest has ever occupied a seat
in the halls of congress—the Rev. Gab-
riel Richard, of Michigan. Not only
was he the only Catholic priest ever
elected to congress, but he was also the
only member who ever came direct
from a prison cell to a seat on the floor.
Father Richard was elected as a
representative of the then territory of
Michigan. This was in 1823. He serv-
ed with distinction, delivering several
exceptionally able speeches on import-
ant issues. He was a man of great
learning, a thorough French and Eng-
lish scholar, and conversant with Span-
ish, German and Italian, and he had
mastered the language or dialect of the
several tribes of Indians of Michigan.
He was a man of medium size, with
sharp features and a bulging forehead,
was slightly bald, had a wiry frame
and was quick in speech and action.

A native of France, he received orders
at a Catholic seminary in Paris in 1792.
Eight years later he came to this coun-
try and for a time was professor of
mathematics in St. Mary’s college,
Maryland. Afterward he labored as a
missionary in Illinois, and finally lo-
cated in Detroit, Mich. While pastor
of St. Anne’s church in that city he be-
gan the publication of a Catholic pa-
per. It became his duty as pastor to
excommunicate a parish brother who had
been divorced from his wife, and this,
together with articles published in
his paper, caused him to be prosecuted
for defamation of character. A fine of
$1,000 or imprisonment for a long per-
iod was imposed, and being poor him-
self and a majority of his parishioners
being French settlers of small means,
he was forced to go to prison, where he
remained until elected to congress.
Father Richard’s career was a re-
markable one in many other particu-
lars. It was he who visited the grave
of Father Marquette, the great mis-
sionary priest of the northwest, and
planted a cross over it on which he
cut the inscription, “Father Marquette
died here May 8, 1675.” Many years
after this the state of Michigan erected
a monument on the spot.
The connection of Catholic clergy-
men with the United States senate and
house of representatives has been only
limited, there being no record of a
Catholic priest in the capacity of con-
gressional chaplain prior to 1832. In
that year the Rev. Constantine Pise,
D. D., pastor of St. Matthew’s church,
Washington, was elected chaplain of
the senate at the instance of Henry
Clay. Father Pise was a native of
Maryland and was educated at George-
town college. On being graduated he
entered the Society of Jesuits, going
to Rome to study theology, and there
he was made a doctor of divinity by
the College of the Sapienza in 1832. He
left St. Matthew’s church, and became
pastor of the Church of the Trans-
figuration in Mott street, New York,
and later of St. Peter’s, in Barclay
street. From there he went to Brook-
lyn and established the Church of St.
Charles Borromeo, where he remained
until his death in 1858.
Father Ryder, S. J., while president
of Georgetown college, on two occas-
ions, opened the senate with prayer
in 1847. Records show that the late
Father Boyle, of St. Patrick’s church,
this city, was the last priest who of-
fered prayer in the old senate chamber,
now the supreme court room.
A Catholic chaplain was never elect-
ed by the house of representatives, but
during one session, when the house
failed to elect a chaplain, Father Boyle
alternated with two Protestant clergy-
men in offering the opening prayer.
The sign of the cross was made for the
first time in the new hall of the house
by Father Aiken, and of this the
Georgetown College Journal of 1870
says:
“On January 24, 1870, the Rev. Char-
les Stonestreet, S. J., pastor of St.
Aloysius church, opened the house
with prayer. Speaker Orr conducted
him to the speaker’s desk. Father
Stonestreet, clothed in his cassock and
wearing his beads, made a large sign
of the cross and read the prayer of
Archbishop Carroll for the authorities.
The prayer over he finished with a de-
vout sign of the cross. As Father
Stonestreet loves the republic and

prays for it from the bottom of his
heart, he read the prayer with a great
deal of feeling.” One month later the
same journal said: “Today Father
Stonestreet, vested in his religious
habit, opened the United States sen-
ate with prayer. The president of the
senate introduced him into the hall.”
Father Mathew, the great apostle of
temperance, addressed the senate in
1849. Unintentionally he created a
sensation by reason of his exposition
of slavery and his supposed denuncia-
tion of slaveholders. Southern sen-
ators opposed admitting him within the
bar of the upper house, but Henry Clay
championed his cause, as did William
H. Seward, and the vote resulted 28
to 18 in favor of conferring an honor
never before given to any foreigner
except General Lafayette. N. Y. Sun.

ARMY FOR THE PHILIPPINES
Far-Sighted Policy Has Proved
Troops Needed Without Delay.
The suspension of active military
operations in the Philippines, render-
ed necessary by the rainy season, has
brought before the country the neces-
sity of additional troops in the archi-
pelago, and the country finds the ad-
ministration ready, without excitement
or haste, to increase the troops under
General Otis’ command to 40,000 men,
and to keep the American army in the
east at this figure until the need for a
force of this size has ceased.
This action and these reinforcements
follow no change of policy and no new
decision. It is the result of the set-
tled plan and purpose adopted last
March by the administration to pre-
pare an army equal to any need likely
to arise. The Spanish war provided
for its immediate and summary dis-
charge when peace came. No man en-
listed for the war but had to be given
his formal discharge at its close, and
the army stood again, as in April, 1898,
at 27,000 men.
A regular army of 65,000 next was
plainly necessary, and the possible de-
mand existed for 35,000 volunteers, per-
mitted by the compromise army bill
of last winter. There were two ways
under which this force of 100,000 men
could be raised and its organization
effected, a task only second to that
faced a year ago. A “call” could be is-
sued and the country launched in the
excitement of “raising 100,000 men,”
with all the “pressure” for places
and commissions, or the work could go
on silently, systematically, without
hurry or bustle, and without disturb-
ance to trade or industry, until the
force was completed.
This plan, adopted last March, has
been followed for nearly four months,
and now that the troops are wanted
the troops are ready. From the troops
discharged, reenlistments were ac-
cepted of picked men. New enlist-
ments have gone on at the rate of 1,000
a week. In all about 38,000 have been
enlisted in the regular army, and it is
now full.
Its regiments have been brought to
their full strength, and will be kept
there. The ruinous and wasteful pol-
icy practiced in the past of forming
new regimental organizations, while
old and veteran regiments were mere
skeletons, has not been followed. The
new men have been fed into old reg-
iments. When these were full, as they
are now, volunteer regiments are be-
ing organized, and these are being se-
lected with the same care and will
be officered from men who have seen
service in the past year and whose
record justifies a commission.
This far-sighted policy has provided
the army which is now needed, and
furnished the troops demanded without
delay or excitement. Instead of a
hasty levy such as was unavoidable a
year ago, and whose haste worked
every flaw and failure in the Spanish
war, there has been for four months
past the slow, steady, systematic crea-
tion of a new army, now of 100,000
men, and which can be carried to
120,000 by the same methods. As this
work comes to be known, appreciated
and understood, criticism will disap-
pear. If there has been, as there may
have been, error in not sending enough
troops earlier to Luzon, the error was
shared by General Otis on the ground,
who has had all he asked. Nor is it
likely that raw levies this spring would
have done more than repeat the illness
and mortality of Cuba a year ago. Raw
troops sicken in the tropics. If
sent there, if they are to be kept free
from illness and kept ready for serv-
ice, must begin their tropical cam-
paign picked, drilled, disciplined, and
taught self-care. This course has been
followed, and it will place in Manila
an army equal next December to the
task of promptly pacifying the only
area resisting the authority of the
United States. Philadelphia Press.

MR. CARNEGIE A PESSIMIST.
Mr. Carnegie is a pronounced pess-
imist. He has written to a friend in
Scotland, saying: “I consider the race
ruined from its moral level, and de-
graded before all thoughtful men.”
Many of us who read this will feel
that it is a harsh judgment; doubtless
he himself would be among those
whose conservatism it blames. And
yet there are many of us who think the
republic possible work in the Phil-
ippines as good and wholesome as the
mission of the millionaire is in the ed-
ucation of the unfortunate; maybe we
are deceiving ourselves. Some of the
Filipinos undoubtedly want to be let
alone, and the author of “Triumphant
Democracy” would have us leave them
to their own devices, bestowing upon
them an independence for which they
are unready—in fact if not desired. Yet
he is not prepared himself to leave the
blacks of the south and the poor whites
of Pennsylvania alone, and permit them
the intellectual independence they
might prefer. Every few days the tel-
egraph tells us of a “substantial bene-
faction to some community” for a lib-
rary or institute. Why is it that the
great iron man cannot leave his peo-
ple to themselves? Why should he try
to lift them to a higher level of think-
ing and living? Have they no right to
go as they choose without libraries and
reading rooms? Why should any out-
sider concern himself in others’ affairs?
