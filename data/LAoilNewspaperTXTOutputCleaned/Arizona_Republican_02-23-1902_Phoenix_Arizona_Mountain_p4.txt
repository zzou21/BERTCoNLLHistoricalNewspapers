The Los Angeles Herald in a recent
issue said of the oil drilling operation,
to be instituted near the Camelback:
A drilling rig has been made by the
Llewellyn Iron Works for the Rand Oil
Company, which is about to operate on
Camelback, close to Phoenix, Ariz.,
that is of exceptional strength and on
that account possesses some new feat
ures. The rig is as complete as either
a hydraulic, a rotary or a standard rig,
and has all iron bullwheel, all iron
sand reel, all iron calf wheel and

trussy head, each set in babbitted iron
boxes and operated by friction clutches
run by iron sprocket belting.
"This rig has been built under the
personal supervision of J. E. Breitwieser
of Pasadena, who is superintendent and
manager of the company, and expects
to leave this city for Phoenix later in
the week after he has seen the drilling
rig shipped south. The reason for such
a strong rig is found in the remoteness
of the operating company from
Los Angeles, and at no nearer point
can drilling supplies be obtained in the

event of any part of the rig breaking.
It has thus been attempted to reduce
the possibility of disaster to a mini
mum. And this has been all the more
essential as the formation to be pene
trated is hard and will require heavy
tools.
Heretofore a description of the
ground to be exploited has been given,
but the first difficulty that the Rand
Oil Company had to contend against was
to reconcile conflicting interests.

Much of the land had been taken up
and was being held for speculative pur
poses, while other lands again were
held under very doubtful location. But
all of these holders were amenable to
reason, and coming together pooled
their interests so that the Rand Com
pany starts out well equipped with a
reasonable amount of money on hand
and the moral support of the entire
community in and about Phoenix.
The machinery is now on the way
to Phoenix and may be expected any
day.

A Sample of Winter Experiences of a
Physician.
A country physician from up the
state was telling some of his old friends
at the University club stories of a prac
tice that covered a radius of twenty
miles from the village in which he
lived.
"Of course," he said, "the weather is
never taken into account by either the
patient or the doctor. Many a night
I've had to go out to my barn and hitch
my old horse in the sleigh with fingers

too cold that I could hardly buckle a
strap and then drive, or rather trust

to my horse's intelligence to drag us
through drifts in the dark to some lone

farmhouse six or eight miles away.

Such a practice has its disappoint
ments. Let me tell you of one. Just

about daylight on one of the coldest,
days last winter when the thermometer

was 25 degrees below or more was
summoned to attend a sick woman, the

wife of a Canadian who lived just at,
the foot of the Adirondacks.
"I put a foot-warmer in my sleigh, I
slid into a fur coat and bundled myself

Well, you nearly killed me, Baptiste,' said I, angry at such a call, 'and
the next time your wife wants to die
you tell her to wait until there is good
snowing, you understand?"
" 'Oui, M'sieur! I know, but ma ole
woman, she don't know, an' she'll die
when she wants to, ba gosh, an' it don't
make any difference what I say.

"Well, there was no use of kicking
about my long drive into the country to
no purpose." I was angry, but Baptiste

would not understand it. I thawed

out, wrapped up, and sent Baptiste
after my horse.
When the sleigh came round to the
door I stepped in and had Baptiste
wrap me up snugly. Just as I was
about to drive away Baptiste said: -
'One minute, M'sieur.' I

" 'Well, what is it, Baptiste?"
Craning over in a mysterious fash
ion he said:
" 'Do you drink r-r-rum-m?"
Now, I'm more or less of a total ab
stainer, but I had a cold ride back of
me and another before me, and Bap
tiste's implied invitation did not fall on
deaf ears. In less time than it takes
to tell it, I had thrown back the robes
and jumped out in the snow with the
remark:
" 'Well, sometimes, Baptiste, and this
is one of them now. I'll take a small

one with you, thanks.'

" 'And you do drink r-r-rum?"
" 'In cold weather, Baptiste.'
" 'Ba gosh. I'm sorry. It is cold
now, and I ain't got no r-rum. If I
had some r-rum I give you some quick,
and she'd be damn good r-rum, too, ba

gosh: but I ain't got no r-rum. On,
she'd be very fine r-rum if I have her.
I drink the last what I got 'way back
last fall some time. She was damn
good r-rum, too."
"I climbed back into my sleigh and
drove home. The next time Baptiste's
wife is sick in the winter I will hesi
tate about going, and if I do I will pro
vide against his rum disappointment.
His assertion that it would be good
rum, if he had it, hurt my feelings."

The sisters in charge of St. Joseph's
Female Orphan asylum are in receipt
of many letters daily from persons who
seek information concerning the prep
aration which is believed by the sisters
to be a preventive against smallpox
and all other contagious diseases. A
few physicians are among the inquir
ers, a small proportion of these having
decided to try the medicine.
"These drugs have been in use by us
for sixty years," said one of the sisters,
"in all that time we have not had one

case of smallpox in our institution. The
prescription was obtained by Mother
Gonzaga more than sixty years ago
from a minister in Germantown. He
got it from a doctor in Paris, who used
it with great success during an epi

demic of smallpox there.

The prescription is one grain solid

extract of digitalis, one grain sulphate of
zinc, one-half teaspoonful of sugar,
four ounces of water. Dissolve the

digitalis and the zinc separately, then
compound the prescription.
It is of the utmost importance that
the solid extract of digitalis be used.

The visit of the Shriners of Arizona
to Phoenix was concluded at midnight
last night by a ball and spread at
O'Neill hall. The meeting was almost
unprecedented in the fact that within
less than two days there were three
banquets, and through it all the inter
est and appetites of the Shriners were
kept up. When the clock struck twelve
and Sunday morning was ushered in
there was a general expression of re
gret that the orgies had not been begun
the day earlier that they might have
been continued one day longer.
Yesterday morning all the Shriners
were in good order except the twenty
two brand new ones, who were some
what the worse for wear. Some of them
were afflicted with ennui in spite of the
novelty and all of them were sore, but
they were glad the ordeal was over
and that they were alive and Shriners.
There was not much time for rest, for
early in the afternoon there was a
conclave of the mysterious daughters
of the Egyptian goddess and the Shrin
ers were dragooned into attendance.
None of them, though, needed dragoon
ing, for they couldn't have been kept
away by chains. There was then an
other banquet, the second.
The crowning festivities were the

ball and supper at O'Neill hall. The
hall was elegantly decorated. Beside
the floral and leafy ornaments there
were the symbols of the order outlined
by incandescent lamps the Square
and Compass, the Triangle and the Star
and Crescent. It was altogether the
greatest congregation in Arizona of
Shriners and their wives and daugh
ters and sisters.
The visitors were: W. K. Maull of
Pantano, J. Redfield of Benson, B. A.
Packard, J. B. Angius, Dr. F. A. Sweet.
Dr. Hickman, Dr. Caven, Otto Geisen
hoffer and S. W. Clawson of Bisbee.
ex-Deputy Sheriff Scott White and wife
of Mexico, Calvert Cain, R. M. Ander
son, N. W. Bernard, R. N. Leather
wood, Andrew Zeigler, Roscoe Dale.
Mr. Deal and A. V. Grosetta of Tucson.
H. J. Allen of Jerome, F. M. Zuck of
Holbrook, R. N. Fredericks, P. A.
Johns, A. D. Barnhart and J. C. Hern
don of Prescott, and Max Salzman of
Williams.
Some of the northern visitors left this
morning. Most of the southern Shrin
ers will go home this evening, and the
departure of all of them will be regretted.
