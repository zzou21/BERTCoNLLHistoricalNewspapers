GILA BEND. May 19—Gila val
ley land is selling: fast. Men of good
judgment are quick to see the great
possibilities and the certain pros
perous future of this section and are
becoming identified in a substantial
way with the country.
Four real farmers from the North
west were brought into the valley
the past week by Mr. Kilpack of the
Gila Water company. They bought
$40,000 worth of valley land. They
are now hurrying back to their new
homes to get themselves established and to work on land that will grow
something every day in the year.
This is what gets them, and there
is many a farmer in the cold north
west who is going to hear some good
news from these men. The stenographer
for the Gila Water company has been working overtime during
the past week making out land con
tracts.
Those of us who have lived in a
small town for some time, in fact,
for years, become careless of the
general look of the town, especially
in regard to the rubbish of all kinds
in the streets. It makes no difference
how neat and clean we keep our
own individual places, for that is the
right thing to do, but to the stranger
who comes into our town the first
thing he notices is our streets and if
we keep them clean it leaves a
good impression to stay with him and
it is up to us individually and col
lectively to get busy and clean up.
It means less flies, less sickness and
is inviting to the man who contem
plates locating in our midst.
It is nearing the roundup season
in the Gila Bend country. The cow
boys are whetting their appetites for
the good old chow in the chuck wag
on. Bob Warren, the genial foreman
of the Tuttle Cattle company, is a busy
man these days, having shipped
three carloads of cattle to the coast
this week. It is hoped when the round
up gets near enough to town that
Bob will put on one of his famous
"sob" stews for the benefit of his
many old time friends who would ap
preciate a little of this wonderful
concoction.
Our new baseball team, with lots
of practice, is gradually getting into
form. The Highway boys played them
Sunday and would not have had a
look in but for the importation of a

or some other seaport. This boy has
the real goods and we predict a
Christy Mathewson future for him.
Needless to say he is now one of us.
The business men of the town have
bought the boys some nice new and
nifty suits. Ajo will be our first vic
tim on the 19th and then as the sea
son progresses we’ll add the scalps
of our other neighbors, Phoenix and
Tucson.
About three months ago Oscar Mc-
Intyre, a young man born and reared
in Gila Bend where he had grown to
early manhood and loved and liked by
everyone, had the misfortune to fall
and break his neck. He was taken
immediately to a hospital in Tucson
and while there was little hope held for
his recovery, still it was sad news
to all of us to hear of his death there
last week. The funeral was held in
Tucson and many were the beautiful
floral tributes sent by his friends
in Gila Bend. Our hearts go out in
sympathy to his mother, sisters and
brother in their sad bereavement.
E. P. Sweet, formerly supervisor
in the Indian service in this section
but now with the Pacific Mutual Life
Insurance company, was a visitor
this week. He knows of the wonderful
future of this country and is
keenly interested in its development.
Mrs. Flavia Parrott, an agent of
the New York Life Insurance com

GILA BEND SOON
TO HAVE ASSET OF
FINE HIGHWAYS
It is gratifying to note the busi
ness-like way in which the highway
work is being done. Cars come in
and are unloaded in a jiffy. Ma
chinery and material are both taken
care of at once and placed in order and
where they will do the most good.
The close proximity of the new high
way to the Gillespie main canal is
helping to solve a problem which has
always hurt road building in a dry
country. With long stretches of hose
the water is used to soak up the new
work and at the proper time a roller
packs it down and the surfacing
begins on a hard packed surface. Yes,
this highway through Gila Bend will
be second to none in Arizona, and it
should be, for in time it will be the
most traveled thoroughfare in the
state.
Of hardly less importance to Gila
Bend and for Phoenix and Ajo for
that matter, is the highway work
almost completed by Pima county from
Ajo toward Gila Bend to the county
line. In connection with this road
from Ajo to Gila Bend, we are pleased
to announce that, through the will
ingness of M. Curley, general man
ager of the New Cornelia Copper
company, to at all times assist in
anything of general good to the com
munity, a right-of-way has been
promised by him over his company’s
property. Col. Tom Smith, a whirl
wind of energy and who always can
be depended upon to help Gila Bend,
has been working on this matter for
some time and was instrumental in

showing the board of supervisors of
Maricopa county the prime import
ance of this road and in meeting with
Mr. Curley to decide on the proper
route so that the proper deeds could
be made out to the county. Mr. Smith
assures us that work on the highway
will start immediately on the receipt
of the deeds by the board. Good
roads have made California, now it is
Arizona's turn.
