BANKRUPTCY

Not "Widely

I

Ltion from which he had --uu

Till to his another falling down rapidly. Moreover

had thence caromed until at last

he reached the bottom and sunk down
beside Dunbar in the mire and slime of
the Gazette.
In the course of his tumbling, Mc
Cord alighted for an instant on the
then new national bankruptcy relief
law. If he had had a mind to be let to
grovel beside Dunbar.
Bankruptcy is not always a disgrace.
It is more frequently a misfortune. A
successful railroad man and coal mine
owner, the father-in-law of John A.

Logan, Jr., died a multi-millionaire a
half dozen years ago after having been
three times a bankrupt. But, unlike
McCord, he always went up instead of
down after each bankruptcy. The
bankruptcy proceedings in the McCord
case occurred more than a year ago,
but so few people know about them
that they may still be regarded as
news. Anything news until after it
has been generally known. In May of

a petition in bank-
Harrison was ap-
pointed trustee and presented a sched-
ule in which it appeared that the as
sets of the bankrupt consisted of no
real estate, but of the following items:
Personal property, $100; a watch and
chain, $30; military uniforms, $23; a
sword and belt, $25, and a literary li
brary, $200; total, $400. The most in-

teresting part of the schedule is the
surprising cheapness of military uni
forms and swords. The claims as fol
low are within the reach of the
lawyers as follows:

The list of the schedule relates to
claims against the estate of McCord.
The claimants are all residents of Wis
consin and Washington, D. C., in both
of which jurisdictions McCord formerly
lived. This is the list:

First National bank, Merrill,
Wis., $1,014.10
W. E. Stewart & Ripley, Oshkosh,
Wis.
H. C. Putnam, Eau Claire, Wis.
Spafford & Co., Rhinelander, Wis.
Julius Theilman, Merrill, Wis.
Charles Zanzow, Merrill, Wis.
Julius Coleman, Washington,
D. C., 1,637.50
All these claims, amounting to $11,-

711.21, had been put in the form of
outstanding indebtedness in notes amounting
altogether with the foregoing claims
to $20,395.06:

Gray & Choate, Oshkosh $

The bunch and Gant and Adams were
chasing him when Gant's horse col
lided with a barbed wire stretched
near the residence of a Mexican fam
ily. Seemingly neither the horse nor
rider had seen the wire till the former
came in contact with it, when he
stopped very suddenly and Mr. Gant
was thrown some distance, alighting
heavily on the back of his head.
Charles Tribolet, who was near by,
was the first to reach him and he and
Mr. Adams carried him, unconscious,
into an adjacent house, from which he
was later removed to his home, No. 120
East Adams street. All afternoon he
lay in a stupor and it was feared
there was no possibility of recovery.

But about 6 o'clock it was thought
that for a moment he recognized Mrs.
Gant. As the hours passed he seemed
to grow a little brighter and watchers
at his bedside at an early hour this
morning expressed their belief that
he would recover. His skull was not
fractured and unless the concussion
results in the formation of a blood clot
on the brain his improvement will no
doubt be rapid.
There is something remarkably co
incident in the occurrence of this
event and one almost of the same na
ture less than a week ago, in which A.
S. Wray was killed. Both received
their fall from the conduct of an ex
cited horse and both struck the ground
in the same manner and the injuries of
both were practically identical. But
there is a noticeable difference in the
two patients in their involuntary ef
forts to regain consciousness, which
gives confidence to those around his
bedside.

The Daily Californian: Canfield,
Doheny and others have struck oil at
a depth of about 900 feet near the half
section stake on the south boundary of
18, 28, 28. So far as can be determined
the strike is a good one, presenting the
same characteristics as elsewhere in
the territory. This well is on the out
skirts. It is more than a mile from the
most northerly line on section 30 and
is equally as far from the Reed Crude's,
near the center of 20. By the discovery
of oil at this point, close to a thousand
acres are added to the district's extent,
assuming that the ground embraced
between is petroleum bearing, as has
been the case uniformly heretofore. No
failure has yet been made in the Kern
River fields to find oil between two
discoveries.

Two heavy freight teams were loaded
Friday at Bakersfield with the final

THE OWNER FROM HIS HORSE

James L. Gant the Victim of a Serious
Accident.

James L. Gant, a well known Phoe
nix cattle man and horseman, and one
of the proprietors of an East Washington
Street meat market, was severely
and it was at first thought fatally in
jured early Monday morning.
With Jack Adams, Mr. Gant was
driving a herd of cattle from the Santa
Fe stock yards to the Balsz and Gant
slaughter house. A calf broke out of

the bunch and Gant and Adams were
chasing him when Gant's horse col
lided with a barbed wire stretched
near the residence of a Mexican fam
ily. Seemingly neither the horse nor
rider had seen the wire till the former
came in contact with it, when he
stopped very suddenly' and Mr. Gant
was thrown some distance, alighting
heavily on the back of his head.
Charles Tribolet, who was near by,
was the first to reach him and he and
Mr. Adams carried him, unconscious,
into an adjacent house, from which he
was later removed to his home, No. 120
East Adams street. All afternoon he
lay in a stupor and it was feared
there was no possibility of recovery..

But about 6 o'clock it was thought
that for a moment he recognized Mrs.

to grow a little brighter and watchers

STRIKE GAS IN NEW DISTRICT.
A flow of gas was struck yesterday
morning in well No. 1 of the Interna
tional Oil company. The company's
property, 4,590 acres in all, is situat
ed four miles northwest of Fullerton, and
is between that point and the Puente
fields. It is a comparatively new dis
trict, but the indications are said to be
more than favorable. The drill was at
the depth of 100 feet when the gas was
liberated, and came rushing out, sending
some of the sixteen-inch casing and
most to the top of the drift. The gas
caught fire, doing some damage,
before the flames could be extinguished.

Basualra-Manister Co.,

The majority of persons upon reaching middle age and past
find their blood becomes weak and thin, and diseases that were
easily controlled in earlier life begin to affect the constitution.

Those predisposed to Scrofula, Cancer, Rheumatism, Gout and other hereditary troubles may escape
till then, but as they age the blood, so long tainted and weakened by accumulated waste matters, is no
longer able to properly nourish the body, and it becomes an easy mark for disease. At this critical period
of life the blood must be re-enforced before it can perform its legitimate functions and rid the system of
these poisons, and nothing so surely and effectually does this as S. S. S.
S. S. S. strengthens and enriches the blood, improves the appetite, and builds up the general constitution.
It is not only the best blood purifier, but the best tonic for old people. It warms the blood, tones up
the nerves, removes all taint from the blood, and prevents the development of disease.
S. S. S. is the only purely vegetable blood medicine known. Not one particle of mercury, potash or
other mineral poison can be found in it, and it may be taken for any length of time without harm.

S. S. S. is the only remedy that reaches deep-seated blood troubles like Scrofula, Cancer, Rheu
matism, Eczema, Tetter, etc. It purifies and restores the blood to a healthy, normal condition, and makes it impossible for
any poisonous waste materials to accumulate.
If you have an old running sore or an obstinate ulcer that refuses to heal, or are troubled with boils and carbuncles, try S. S. S.

It never fails to make a quick and permanent cure of these pests. If your system is run down and you feel
the need of a tonic, S. S. S. will strengthen and help you as it has many others to a happy, healthy old age.

Mrs. D. R. Johnson, of Blackshear, Ga., was for years afflicted
with a severe type of rheumatism, and had used every remedy
known and recommended as a cure without receiving any
relief. S. S. S. promptly reached the seat of the disease and
made a complete and permanent cure.

If you are in doubt about your disease, and will send us a statement of your case, our physician will
give you any information or advice wanted, for which we make no charge.
Book on Blood and Skin Diseases sent to any desiring it. Address Swift Specific Co., Atlanta, Ga.

S. S. S. cured Mr. H. Borden of Sautesville, Va., of a case of
Eczema of thirty-five years standing, after the best physicians
in the surrounding country had failed. This was seven years
ago, and there has been no return of the disease.
