THEORY THAT LEAP
YEAR IS UNLUCKY
In all probability the theory that
leap year is unlucky was voiced by
the unhappy man who first was called
upon to answer a woman's leap year
proposal that he bestow upon her his
"hand and fortune or a braw silk gown."

The Japanese believe that the 210th
and the 220th days of each leap year
are particularly unlucky, while the old
English traditions maintain that children born in leap year will be sickly
and difficult to raise, and that crops
will not prosper, peas and beans
growing on the wrong side of the pod."
