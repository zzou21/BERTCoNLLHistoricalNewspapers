Teams Monday Game With Tempe Excites Interest

Here Tonight for New Schedule Pow-Wow  

Pitcher Barngrover  
to Face Locals Today  

In the last battle of the first year  
of the war, the brave veterans of  

General Yates’ division will strive  
against the equally brave veterans of  
the Mesaite horde led by General  
Brackett. And the field of carnage  
will be located at Grant park. Owing  
to a twist in the battle lines,  
the Maroons and Tempeites will not  
clash on this, the most memorable  
day since the league began its struggles  
‘way back in the dim beginnings  
of baseballic time.  
While the Phoenicians and invading  
Highlanders are swinging on each  
others’ jaws this afternoon, forty feet  
more of howling fans will be glomming  
huge eyefuls of the gory sight.  
That is to say, Yates has done making  
a noise like a hammer knocker  

and the addition to the grand stand  

is a fact accomplished. The new section  
is on the east end of the north  
face, and will raise the seating capacity  
of the park to twelve hundred.  
In addition to setting out after  
Mesa’s nanny this afternoon, the  
Ritchie legions are going to try a  
fall with Tempe’s sluggers on Monday.  
This will mean two stiff games  
for Friend Phoenix ball team in two  
days, and if both are local victories,  
there will be about ten or a dozen  
mighty good and tired ball players  
stuck moist uniforms Monday eve  
about the time the sun gets low in  
the west. But the dopesters are figuring  
on Phoenix being weighty  
enough to swing both these games in  
one grand and glorious row. “We  
have it in us to grab something good  
now, and about two more victories  
to end the first round will taste  
mighty lickin’ good.”  

McDevitt is its name.  
It’s a third baseman and general  
utility man.  
It will be in a Phoenix uniform  
this day BUT it will loll upon the  
bench when the first inning begins.  
Or so it was at headquarters  
dope last night. Mack is some third

baseman, it seems, being a Wisconsin  
University man, and a once powerful  
member of the Cincinnati team,  
“Vhas you eveh dere?”  
Aside from that, the Phoenix lineup  
is just as it has been for some  
notches past.  
Hall, the monster Phoenician, will  
show his big frame and his infant  
face, from the mound. His battery  
mate will be the ever-present Pep  
Cook, small of stature, but everlastingly  
full of that said ginger. Toggy  
Tognerio will stand at the first stop,  
facing the smiling circle composed of  
Gooch, Whitt and Cap Ritchie. Barton,  
Reynolds and Hap Clow will get  
sunburned in the fields, especially  
Clow, who has been mighty lucky in  
not getting more joshed over the present  
denuded condition of his pate.  
Who will hurl for “our boys” tomorrow?  
Well, sir, “durned if you  
know, for I don’t,” as the saying  
goes. Yates threatens to pitch Captain  
Ritchie, unless Hall wants to  
work overtime. The dearth of Phoenix  
heavers at the present time is  
something scandalous. Something will  
have to be did about it, while didding  
is good. Still, Yates, in high spirits  
and a gay mood says, “I should worry”  
in a Yiddish accent and passes  
the troubles off like a duck gets rid of  
raindrops.  

League Meeting

Meet Program for September 12  

To a man up a tree  
It looks like a good year for automobile  
and motorcycle races in the  
great southwest, or more especially  
that portion of the southwest that  
lines the great travel lines east and  
west from Phoenix.  
The significance of three automobile  
races, totalling in their courses  
nearly sixteen hundred miles, is  
gradually dawning on the community  
and people are beginning to realize  
what a tremendous advertising value  
lies in the series of contests. The  
result of this awakening has been  
feverish activity all along the lines  
of the races. Ten cities work  
stronger than three so when all the  
towns along the race courses start  
in, there is just that much more assurance  
of success for the competitions.  
But the road races will be only  
the outside part of the program for  
the 1913 state fair. Track races for  
autos and motorcycles will form another  
large part of the excitement.  
With drivers of national reputation  
struggling for speed supremacy on  
the fast Phoenix track, the eyes of  
the whole world will be turned upon  
this town on automobile day, the  
most popular of all the fair days.  

Motorbike Races  
The two-wheelers will occupy the  
stage also this fall, taking a much  
larger share in events than last. In  
fact, the motorcycle races will class  
up right alongside the automobile  
races for popularity. And the secret  
of that is, the club which has been  
dormant for years is now revived.

just as the Maricopa auto club was  
revived, and its actions made to  
mean something. Already the club  
is making itself felt. Business-like  
arrangements are now being made  
for handling a preliminary motorcycle  
race meet on September 12,  
in order to raise part of the fund of  
five hundred dollars necessary to secure  
a motorcycle road race from  
San Diego to Phoenix.  
The suggestion for the road race  
came from the San Diego Motorcycle  
club, whose members are fired  
by the preparations for the big  
brother races this fall. The proposal  
acted like an electric shock on the  
Phoenix club, which at once set out  
to make good at this end of the line.  
The chugbike race will start a day  
or so before the Los Angeles to  
Phoenix race is called. The riders  
will have the advantage of the road  
work and the signs that are to be  
put up for the autoists on the last  
part of the Los Angeles-via-San  
Diego-to-Phoenix course. Some of  
the riders here, who are figuring on  
entering the desert grind say the  
race can be negotiated in less than  
fifteen hours, but others consider  
this entirely too optimistic and say  
if the machine that wins “can poke  
its nose through the sand, rock,  
gravel and mud in twenty hours, it  
will be a whole lot to the rider’s  
credit. At any rate, the motorcycle  
race is likely to be fast for San  
Diego, going to win this event from  
all other entries promises to put in  
some mighty fast machines.  

Preliminary Race Data  
There has been a lot of talk  
around town something like this:  
“I don’t think I’ll enter. I never  
rode before, and I wouldn’t stand a  
chance against some of those wise  
heads.” In order to make the races  
more varied and better filled, the  
management has decided to use two  
events that will be limited strictly  
to amateur riders. One of these  
races will be for singles and one for  
twins, each with the recognized piston  
displacement limit of 30.50, and  
61 cubic inches for singles and twins  
respectively.  
Then there will be two free-for-alls,  
and a handicap event. The latter  
will be handled by the committee,  
and handicaps once settled will not  
be changed. A fee of twenty-five  
cents will be charged for each event  
and riders must enter at the downtown  
headquarters of the club, the  
whereabout of which will be announced  
later. Entry to one race  
carries free admittance to the  
grounds, but the entrant must compete.  

And That Parade  
In order to let folks know that  
there is such a thing as a motorcycle  
club in Phoenix, the members  

Barngrover  
He will wear a Mesa uniform this  
afternoon, but that’s all right. Busted  
Mitt Bill is to try out former teammates  
at Grant park.  

Salt River Valley league magnates  
this night in Phoenix, the outsiders  
the guests of the local managers,  
Castle and Yates. At this confab,  
the bosses will plan out another two  
or three weeks’ schedule and make  
up a few laws about this thing and  
that. Mostly that. No serious questions  
are on the horizon, so the conference  
tonight will have to be tagged  
“League Meeting,” or no one will  
know what it is, for it will be so different.  
No National Cornish stuff  
here!

ELEVEN FAST EVENTS  
FOR CHUGBIKE MEET  
The program of the Motorcycle  
meet of September 12, complete except  
for the one item of prizes  
has been made up by the committee  
of the Phoenix Motorcycle club.  
The classy list is as follows:  

Event 1.  
Five miles for singles ridden by  
novices. This will allow anyone to  
enter who has never raced before.  

Event 2  
Five mile free-for-all for singles.  

Event 3  
Five miles for twins (61 cu. in.)  
ridden by novices.  

Event 4  
Ten miles for twins in the 61 cu.  
in. class, free-for-all.  

Event 5  
Two-mile bicycle race, free-for-all.  
Messenger kids and newsies  
especially invited.  

Event 6  
Mile time trial for special twin.  
This is for track record, and will  
be entered by one specially built  
machine with ported cylinders. Record  
of 1:04 now held by Shorty  
Belding of Prescott will probably mark.  

Event 7  
Fifteen-mile free-for-all handicap  
for club championship, carrying prize  
medal.  

Event 8  
Three-mile relay for singles and  
twins, changing machines at end of  
each mile.  

Event 9  
Five-mile handicap for non-winners.  

Event 10  
Mile flying start time trial for  
singles, medal as prize.  

Event 11  
Mile flying start time trial for  
twins, club medal as prize.  

The time trials for stock singles  
and twins will be for the thirty, fifty  
and sixty-one inch machines, but the  
special direct driven racer will be in  
a class by itself and without competition.  
This special track record stunt  
will be probably the most interesting  
of the three.  

The rider for the monster  
will not be announced until the afternoon  
of the race.  
Will parade on their machines the  
morning of the races. In this procession  
will be many machines of  
all sizes, years and makes. Everybody  
owning a two wheeled gasoline  
propelled vehicle, no matter what  
make or model, is asked to be in  
that procession. The parade will  
be orderly withal, for it is the most  
insistent demand of the managing  
committee that the club and its  
friends make a good impression on  
the people of Phoenix.

COAST LEAGUE  

Marathon Muddle  
LOS ANGELES, August 30.—A  
brace of hits, one a three-bagger by  
Bayless in the fifteenth inning, broke  
up the longest game of the season  
today, Venice defeating Oakland 3 to  
2. It was a wonderful contest  
throughout. For eleven innings it  
was a hotly contested pitchers’ battle  
between Malarkey and Hitt, although  
the latter appeared to be weakening  
at that stage. He gave way to a  
pinch hitter. Malarkey improved as  
the game went into extra innings,  
but he let down in the fifteenth.  
Koestner, who relieved Hitt, was a  
puzzle to the Oakland batters.  
Had not Kaylor allowed O’Rourke’s  
pop fly to go through his hands in  
the eleventh, the game would have  
been an errorless one. Kaylor, however,  
starred at bat for Oakland,  
driving in the northerners’ two tallies  
with a home run in the sixth.  
Dusk settled over the field as the  
winning run crossed the plate, and  
it is probable that the game would  
have been called at the close of the  
fifteenth had it not been decided in  
that period. One of the Oakland players  
started a bonfire and the game  
was delayed several minutes while  
the umpires tried to ascertain the  
identity of the mischief maker.  
Score  
R. H. E.  
Venice 3 13 0  
Oakland 2 8 1  
Batteries: Hitt, Koestner and Elliot;  
Malarkey and Rohrer, Mitze.  

Crabbe Crabs  
SAN FRANCISCO, August 30.—  
Jesse Baker pitched a three-hit game  
for San Francisco and his teammates  
supported him with errorless ball,  
and this brought about the defeat of  
Los Angeles, 3 to 0. Crabbe lost the  
game for the Angels in the first three  
innings, in which he allowed five hits  
that yielded the Seals their three  
runs. He was taken out in the third  
with one on base and one out. Gregory  
pitched a good game after his  
retirement, but the game was already  
lost.  
Score  
R. H. E.  
San Francisco 3 9 0
