THE IRISH LAND BILL

THOUSAND DELEGATES

In the Great National Convention of
the United Irish league at Dublin

The Temper of the Delegates Shown When They Greeted
With Hisses a Proposition to Reject its Amendments
to the Measure and the Manner of Formulating and
Presenting Them to Parliament Will Be Taken Up
Today Speeches by Messrs. Redmond and O'Brien
Urging the Adoption of the Bill.

Dublin, April 16. The national con
vention convened by the United Irish
league met today in the historic round
room of the mansion house. About
2,000 delegates assembled in the crowded
rotunda, which was incapable of
holding all who had come from every
part of Ireland to discuss the Irish land
bill. On the platform sat almost every
nationalist member of parliament, with
a scattering of prelates. In the body of
the rotunda was a gathering seldom
equalled in a representative capacity.
Farmers from Clare in top boots, laborers
from Dublin county, landlords
from Cork, and priests from all parts,
the latter's sombre clothing and tall
hats contrasting pleasantly with the
bright homespun apparel of the ma
jority. It was essentially a convention of the
soil, though a brighter touch was given
by the presence of the well dressed
women who filled the galleries.
Lord Mayor Harrington and Michael
Davitt inducted John Redmond into
the chair and the delegates rose to their
feet, cheering and waving their hands.
John Redmond opened the proceedings
with an impressive speech. Mr. Red
mond begged his hearers to remember
their tremendous responsibility. If they
rejected the bill it was dead forever,
and the greatest prospect of freedom
since the infamous Act of Union was
passed would disappear.
Mr. Redmond deprecated carping
criticism and advocated a friendly dis
cussion of the suggestion of amend
ments. He hoped the convention would
pass O'Brien's motion welcoming the
bill and amending it in various partic
ulars and entrusting the amendment
to the decision of the Irish parliamentary
party. "And," concluded Mr.
Redmond, "let us give the world, which
is watching us, by our orderliness, wis
dom and restraint, proof of our ca
pacity for self-government."
William O'Brien congratulated Ire
land on the fact that the British min
istry had introduced a bill accepting
the principle, after centuries of strug
gle, that the land should be restored
to the people, and he urged the dele
gates to pass amendments enlarging
the financial scope of the bill. Mr.
O'Brien, however, asked the conven
tion to entrust to the parliamentary
party the power and responsibility of
eventually dealing in the committee
stage with the amendments. While
begging the delegates to let their par
liamentary representatives settle the
matter, Mr. O'Brien attacked the land
lords, Irish judges and British rule
with the same virulence as has always
marked his speeches, to the intense de
light of the audience, which, swayed
by his eloquence, hissed and cheered
alternately.
He said if properly amended, Mr.
Wyndham's bill would "make the
peasants as safe as the king on his
throne, in the possession of their land.
They would never again have to stand
trembling in the rent office." Mr.
O'Brien concluded with saying that
while Mr. Redmond himself did not
want to entangle the land question
with home rule, they might as well
"try to turn honest Irish blood into
red ink as to allay his own and Ire
land's desire for eventual home rule."
When Patrick White, M. P., rose and
moved the rejection of the land bill as
not meriting the support of the Irish
party, the delegates hissed him and an
angry cry of "Withdraw" came from
all sides.
The announcement that Mr. White's
motion had been rejected by an over
whelming majority created tremend
ous enthusiasm. Only a few hands
were held up in favor of Mr. White's
motion, while hundreds were waved
when "to the contrary" was called, and
hats were thrown up and the conven
tion enthusiastically committed itself
to the land bill, subject to such amend
ments as the Irish parliamentary par
ty can secure.
Michael Davitt also made a strong
plea in behalf of the Irish agricultural

laborer, which he will elaborate tomor
row when the suggested amendments
are taken up in detail. He maintained
that the bill, even as amended, would
not put an end to the land struggle,
and moved in friendly terms an amend
ment to Mr. O'Brien's motion, that the
nationalist members of parliament re
fer the bill back to the convention for
approval, after passing the committee
stage in the house of commons so that
the people themselves may say if they
accept it as amended and that the con
vention be merely adjourned instead of
dissolved.
Mr. Redmond, in reply, paid a tribute
to Mr. Davitt's fairness and the bene
fit derived from his presence and sup
port, but he said he believed his
amendment would be construed as a
vote of a want of confidence in the
Irish parliamentary party. Mr.
O'Brien followed with an impassioned
appeal on the same lines. He declared
that Mr. Davitt's amendment menaced
the Irish party. Mr. Davitt then, amid
tremendous cheering, withdrew his
amendment, on whose merits the con
vention seemed fairly equally divided,
and the threatened split was avoided.
By a unanimous vote the convention
accepted in its principle the Irish land
bill and entrusted to John Redmond
and his party the task of securing in
the house of commons the "amend
ments in various points of vital im
portance" which the national conven
tion may consider essential. The con
vention tomorrow will outline the shape
that the amendments should take and
on Saturday Lord Dunraven, Lord
Mayor Captain Shawe-Taylor, John
Redmond, William O'Brien and T. W.
Russell are likely to meet, at a round
conference table to discuss the landlords'
and tenants' opinions on the land
bill and try to arrive at a common
basis of parliamentary action.

HERO OF MAFEKING
IN THIS COUNTRY
He Has Come to Study American
Cavalry Methods.
Washington, D. C., April 16. Major
General R. Baden Powell, the "hero
of Mafeking," recently appointed chief
of cavalry of the English army, is vis
iting the United States to study the
American cavalry tactics and methods.
In order that he may accomplish his
purpose with as little publicity and
ceremony as possible he is traveling in
incognito and unofficially.
He arrived here last night unannounc

his respects to Secretary Root, Lieut
enant General Miles and Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin. The cavalry troops at
Fort Myer gave a special exhibition
of their proficiency in cavalry drill and
tactics for the benefit of the distinguished
visitor, who left here to visit the

New York, April 16. The speculative
activity which developed yesterday and
was interrupted by the announcement
of the refusal made of the demands by
the Manhattan Elevated railroad em
ployes, was renewed today when sup
port was forthcoming from the Man
hattan. It was hoped that the labor
difficulties on the elevated system
would be adjusted without resort to a
strike and this induced some short cov

BORROWED A PACKAGE.
And Learned the Scientific Value of
Pure Food.
Taking notice of little things is a val
uable faculty in life and many great
discoveries have sprung from a humble
source indeed.
"One day," says a lady of Norwich,
N. Y., a sister of the county judge and
surrogate of Chenango county, "I no
ticed on a grocer's shelf the now fa
miliar package of Grape-Nuts. I asked
him to let me see it, read what it had
to say for itself, paid the 15 cents re
quired by the merchant and became its
possessor.
"At this time I had lost my desire for
food having suffered so terribly from
indigestion and all of its attendant
evils that no food agreed with me or
attracted me. But from the time that
I began to eat my first package of
Grape-Nuts I began to improve, eat
ing it every morning and frequently at
noons and nights.
"I very soon found my whole
strength coming back to me with add
ed force. I gained in flesh and also
found I could eat what others did with
relish without any ill effects following.
In short it has changed my life.
"A few weeks since I visited a niece
in Pennsylvania whose stomach re
fused to care for any food put into it.
Rice, whole wheat bread and other
foods had to be pumped out ten hours
after eating. I suggested Grape-Nuts
and she ate it and when the contents
of her stomach were siphoned out
there was no trace of Grape-Nuts
to be found it had digested and been
assimilated. She made great gains in
strength and flesh while I was there
and made the six mile ride to Scranton
three times, something she had not
been able to do for three months pre
vious." Names furnished by Postum

A FIST FIGHT
BETWEEN LAWYERS

Bone of Contention in Insane
Young Millionaire
An Incident in An Indiana Court in
the Controversy for the Possession
of Young Chase Lately Brought
Back From Trance.
Lafayette, Ind., April 16. There
was a fist fight in the circuit court
room this afternoon between Attorneys
Simms, representing Fred Chase,
father of the young millionaire, Moses
Fowler Chase, and A. L. Kumler, rep
resenting Mr. and Mrs. Charles Duhme,
of Cincinnati, who are fighting for the
possession of young Chase. The attor
neys had met for a conference with the
judge as to what should be done with
Moses Fowler Chase, pending the hear
ing of the guardianship case. Kumler
denounced the attorneys on the other
side and also Chase's father, and de
clared that Moses Fowler Chase had
been brought to Indiana from France
by force and fraud. He had further as
serted that the unfortunate young man
was put on exhibition at the law offices
of Chase's attorneys, when Ex-Judge
E. P. Hammond shouted "That's an
absolute falsehood."
Attorney Simms jumped up from his
seat, and approached Kumler, who
tried to ward him off. Simms then
landed a fierce right hand swing on
Kumler's jaw, and followed it with a
smash with his left. Both blows land
ed. Kumler protecting himself as best
he could.
The court room was crowded and
lawyers, court officials and spectators
sprang toward the combatants and
dragged them apart. The judge fined
Simms $25. Simms then apologized,
and Kumler asked the court to remit
the fine. The court remitted the fine
and directed that Moses Fowler Chase
remain in this court's jurisdiction, with
the understanding that Mr. and Mrs.
Duhme, who are his aunt and uncle, are
not to interfere with him. They are
to have the privilege to appeal to the
court for authority to see him, how
ever. The guardianship application
served on the young millionaire is re
turnable on April 27 for which day the
case is set.
Several doctors examined young
Chase this afternoon and pronounced
him insane.

NEW TRAP CHAMPION,
In the Grand American Handicap at
Kansas City.
Kansas City, Mo., April 16. M. Dief
endorfer of Wood River, Neb., shooting
from the 16-yard limit, today won the
fourth Grand American handicap at in
animate targets with a score of 94 out
of a possible 100. In winning the event,
he defeated practically all expert
marksmen of the country, as all of the
shooters of note were entered. Dief
endorfer, being a low handicap man,
shot during the latter part of the con
test, and contrary to the rule, made
his best score at the last set of traps,
where he broke twenty-five targets
without a miss. Diefendorfer has been
shooting at targets for about four
years, but he has never before entered
a national tournament, always having
been an amateur.
Max E. Hensler, of Battle Creek,
Mich., a nineteen-year-old boy, shoot
ing from the 17-yard limit, was second
to Diefendorfer, making a score of 93.
Hensler broke 24 at each of the first
three traps, but at the fourth he got
some exceedingly difficult targets and
missed four. Hensler's record for the
tournament has been excellent. Be
sides being second in the Grand Amer
ican handicap, he won the trophy in the
preliminary handicap. Hensler and D.
T. Timberlake of Seneca, Kan., each
broke 81 targets in the preliminary
handicap, but in the shoot off today
Hensler won by breaking 23 targets out
of 25, while Timberlake broke only
21.
L. J. Squirer of Wilmington, Dela.,
19 yards, and C. B. Adams of Rock
well City, Ia., 18 yards, tied for third
honors in the Grand American, each
making scores of 92. Forty-three men
will divide the purse in the Grand
American handicap all of whom made a
score of 83 or better.
The trophy of victory was a hand
some gold watch.
RIGHT TO ORGANIZE
IS RECOGNIZED
But Manufacturers Want the Unions
Properly Conducted.
New Orleans, April 16. The National
Association of Manufacturers this af
ternoon elected the following officers:
President, D. M. Parry, Indianapolis;
secretary, Marshal Cushing, New
York: treasurer, F. H. Still, New
York.
J. C. Nunemacker of Kentucky urged
the association to present united op
position to what he termed, "the an
archistic and socialistic element which
controls many of the labor unions,"
but declaring that the association must
admit the right and justice of organized
labor properly conducted.
"Let this be our motto," he said.
"Fair play to the workingmen and
America for us all, employee and employ
er." The sentiment was violently applaud
ed. Pittsburg was selected as the place
of meeting for the convention next
year.
The convention ended with the
unanimous re-election of Mr. Parry.
There had been much talk of a move
ment for his defeat for the presidency
of the association, owing to his position
on the labor question, but there were
no surface indications of dissension.
When the election occurred, the con
vention, with cheers, ordered the sec
retary to cast the ballot of the dele
gates. An effort was made to secure
the adoption of a resolution favoring
tariff revision, but it was tabled.
GOMPERS REPLIES TO PARRY.
Washington, D. C., April 16. Presi
dent Gompers of the American Federa
tion of Labor, today gave out a state
ment in reply to the annual report of
President Parry, of the Manufacturers'
association, which was read before
that body in New Orleans. It says:
"If there were any doubt that Mr.
Parry had taken leave of his reason,
the report (or rather harangue) which
he had made to his convention demon
strates it beyond any doubt. If the
Manufacturers' association in conven
tion at New Orleans endorses Mr.
Parry's undigested and malicious an
tagonism to the effort of the workers
to secure material and moral improve
ment they simply vote themselves
down to his low level, and stand com
mitted with him for all the injury
which must follow from his rabid ut
terances, his venomous and ignorant
antagonism, which must provoke only
union sentiment and retaliation.
"Organized labor is the result of our
industrial development and environ
ment. It purposes to secure a larger
share of the production of wealth. It
seeks to secure this object by peaceful
and lawful methods. It aims to estab
lish more rightful relations between
man and man.
"Organized labor is here to stay yes,
to stay long after Mr. Parry's name
shall have been forgotten. It has sur
vived many encounters with men of
Mr. Parry's calibre.
"Organized labor seeks no such con
flict as Mr. Parry would promote, nor
will it run away from it. We desire
industrial and social peace, and are
making for it, Mr. Parry, and those
who act with him to the contrary not
withstanding. We shall be enabled soon
to discern to what extent the manufacturers
of the United States are in accord with
Parry. At this writing, we are confi
dent that he represents but an infinitesimal
part of the American employers.
Organized labor faces the future,
confident and self reliant and hurls
back into the teeth of Mr. Parry his
foul vituperation and abuse."

OIL BURNING.
To Be Extended on the Santa Fe's
Lines in Arizona.
Los Angeles, Cal., April 16. An
nouncement was made today from the
headquarters of the Santa Fe system
in this city that the road would soon
install oil burning locomotives on the
Seligman-Winslow division in Arizona
adding about 146 miles to the mileage
now covered by oil burning engines on
the Santa Fe system.
The change will increase the Santa
Fe's consumption of fuel oil from 30,-
000 to 35,000 barrels per month. The
company will then be burning a total
of from 140,000 to 150,000 barrels all of
which is supplied by its own wells in
this state.

L. C. STOCK MARKET
REVIEW OF A WEEK
Increase in the Receipts Over Those
of a Year Ago.
Kansas City, Mo., April 16. (Special)
Cattle receipts last week amounted to
29,287 head, against 24,908 head the
same week last year, and also showed
a gain of 2,000 over previous week.
There was a fair run of western fed
steers on Tuesday and Wednesday, but
small on others days of week. Best
price was reached Thursday, at $4.80
for 1,249 pound steers. Trade was ac
tive and snappy each day, and closed
15 to 25 cents higher for the week.
Choice light heifers also sold higher.
Mixed cows and heifers, 8,6 pounds,
sold at $4.40 Tuesday. Any steer stuff
carrying decent flesh brought from
$3.65 up. Fat bulls were dull. Colo
rado stockers sold at $4.10 Tuesday,
and Colorado feeders, 935 pounds,
brought $4.65 Friday. Good kinds of
stockers and feeders gained 10 to 25
cents during the week. Pastures are
earlier in this territory than for twelve
years, and thin cattle are now in more
request on this account.
The run today is light at 5,000 head
same as a week ago. Market opened
steady, but strength soon developed,
and most sales of cattle were strong to
10 cents higher than best time last
week. Outside demand for fat steers,
which has heretofore been largely ab
sent, puts new life in all grades of
cattle, especially lending confidence to
stocker and feeder buyers. The gen
eral cattle situation is better than it
has been for some time.
Sheep receipts last week amounted
to 26,882 head, against 14,353 head the
corresponding week last year, and were
made up almost entirely of killing
stock. Up to Wednesday the market
was on the boom and prices on wooled
lambs reached $7.60 and on wethers
$5.60, both record prices. Later in the
week, lower eastern reports and liberal
supply made prices weak, and wethers
put 15 cents off, and even some
clips 27 cents lower. Too many light
weight Mexican lambs arrived, and
prices of such are off 25 cents. Best
smelts are 5 to 15 cents lower. Re
ceipts today were upwards of 8,000
head, embracing 3,500 Arizona grass
sheep. The latter sold at $6.00 for
sheep and yearlings mixed, weighing
84 pounds, and $5.00 for 90 pound ewes.
The general market today was steady
to slow. Best Colorado lambs brought
$7.40 weighing 79 pounds.
The horse trade last week was satis
factory to sellers. The outlook seems
good for range horse prices this seas
on. Heavy purchases for the British
army, the drouth, the settlement of the
Arkansas valley, are given as reasons
for a shortage in the supply, and con
sequent better price for range horses.
Unbroke westerns are worth $35.00 to
$45.00 and broke stock $30.00 to $75.00.

FIRST BUSINESS
IN EIGHT DAYS
President Roosevelt Meets His Pri
vate Secretary.
Cinnabar, Mont., April 16. President
Roosevelt came into Fort Yellowstone
today, looking to be in splendid condi
tion and enthusiastic over the good
time he has had. Secretary Loeb met
him at Major Pitcher's headquarters
and the two transacted some routine
business, the first that president has
done with his secretary since he went
into the park.
After his return from his visit to the
president, Secretary Loeb issued the
following statement: "Major Pitcher
reports that the president and party
have just returned from their eight
days' horseback trip in the north of
the park, and along the Yellowstone.
"The party consisted of the president,
Major Pitcher and John Burroughs, to
gether with an orderly, the scouts and
the packers with the mule train. All
of the party are in excellent health,
and not an accident of any kind oc
curred. On entering the park the presi
dent informed Major Pitcher that he
would not under any circumstances fire
a shot at anything while in the park,
and he took neither rifle nor shotgun
with him.
"The party had some good fishing,
and the president and Mr. Burroughs
spent a large part of the time in fol
lowing and watching at close quarters
the great herds of game, chiefly elk,
buffalo, mountain sheep, deer and ante
lope. The party will start tomorrow
for the interior of the park to visit
the geysers and perhaps the falls of the
Yellowstone. They will go in sleighs,
on horseback or on skis, according to
the condition of the snow."
METROPOLITAN FIGURES.
The Company Is Asking for Much More
Than It Needs.
New York, April 16. The Evening
Post today prints the following: The
complete findings of Eugene A. Philbin,
former district attorney of New York
county, as counsel for certain stock
holders of the Metropolitan Street
Railway company were made public
today.
This paragraph occurs: "It is clear,
therefore, when the company's own
statements are analyzed, that the Inter
urban lease was calculated to provide
and has actually provided many
millions of dollars in excess of the hon
est requirements of the Metropolitan
company."
The report also finds that in 1898,
1899, 1900 and 1901 the Metropolitan
company stated in its annual report to
the state railroad commission that it
had expended for construction and
equipment a sum in cash "exceeding by
millions of dollars the actual sum in
cash which is proved by the company's
general balance sheet to have been ex
pended." Mr. Philbin says the company
asked for $23,000,000 to pay the
unfunded debt incurred in the pur
chase of stock of the Third Avenue
company and to defray the expense of
extending the electrical system to up
wards of eighty millions, still operated
with horse cars and upon analysis the
report said that only $14,781,694 was re
quired for those two purposes.
The governor further says the company
proposed to create a refunding mort
gage to secure an authorized issue of
$65,000,000 of 4 per cent one hundred
year refunding bonds of which about
$54,000,000 was to be reserved to retire
and refund the twenty-seven issues ex
isting bonds secured by liens upon the
various parts of the Metropolitan sys
tem, excluding the Third Avenue lines.
The total issue, of such issues, Mr.
Philbin says was exactly $48,196,000 and
not about $54,000,000.
"The difference," the report says,
"between $48,196,000 and $65,000,000 is
$16,804,000."
