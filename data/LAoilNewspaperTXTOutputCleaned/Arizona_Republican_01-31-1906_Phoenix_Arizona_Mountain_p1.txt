RAILROAD RATE BILL

INTERESTS THE HOUSE

The Debate on the Hepburn Measure Filled
the Day.

The Speeches Were All in
Directed to the Speakers
Opposition.
Washington, Jan. 3. Members of
the house evinced a more serious interest in
the discussion of the railroad
rate bill throughout the day than any
topic of legislation for some time. The
debate throughout was listened to at
tentively and many questions were
asked of the different speakers to
bring out either obscure points in the
measure or evils complained of, which
no attempt had been made to include
in the bill.
The debate was opened by Mr.
Townsend, of Michigan, in an ex
haustive argument on the general sub
ject, and sharp criticism was directed
toward those who had opposed the
railroad rate legislation. Mr. Adam
son, of Georgia, representing the mi
nority, followed in commendation of
the measure and in praise of President
Roosevelt's stand on the question,
which, he said, the minority were
availing themselves of in the present
instance. Mr. Hinshaw, of Nebraska,
depicted the benefit the legislation
would do to the great trans-Missouri
country, and Mr. Richardson, of Ala
bama, discussed as a democrat the
things left undone in the measure.
Questions addressed to the various
speakers by Mr. Sherley, of Kentucky,
and Mr. Littlefield, of Maine, indicat
ed that there is to be some opposition
to the bill, at least in debate. The
feature seemingly subject to attack
is as to just what will be the authori
ty of the interstate commerce commis
sion under the bill, relative to differ-

THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
The Senate Passes a Bill For Its Re
organization.
Washington, Jan. 3. The senate
today passed about forty bills, many
of them of considerable importance.
The list included a number of meas
ures for lighthouses, fog signals, reve
nue cutter vessels, and public build
ings, and also the bill providing for
the reorganization of the consular ser
vice, which passed practically without
discussion.
It makes many changes in the ser
vice, among which are the following:
It provides for the classification of
consular officers in grades, gives the
president authority to transfer officers
from one station to another, provides
an inspection service with five in
spectors, who are to rank as consuls
general, requires that clerks at con
sulates shall be American, prohibits
consuls from engaging in law busi
ness, and requires that all consular
fees shall be accounted for.
The shipping bill was under consid
eration for a time. It was amended
so as to relieve it from constitutional
objections, and Mr. Lodge delivered a
speech in support of the bill, in which
he gave details of a combination of
the owners of foreign sailing vessels
for the purpose of controlling the
freight rates on grain shipments from
the United States.
There was also a discussion of the
bill making common carriers liable
for injuries to employees, which arose
over the question of the reference of
the bills to committees. Some of the
senators intimated that the commit-

tees were anxious to avoid the re

sponsibility of passing upon these
measures.
Mr. Patterson gave notice of a
speech tomorrow on the Moroccan and
Dominican questions.
SENATE RESOLUTIONS.
Washington, Jan. 30. A resolution
providing for the payment of the fu
neral expenses of the late Senator
Mitchell of Oregon amounting to $547
was reported to the senate and adopt
ed. A resolution directing the secre
tary of the navy to send to the sen
ate the records of the court-martial
at Annapolis in the cases of Midship
men Marson and Mayo, and also to
inform the senate as to the authority
for the proceedings adopted.
HE HAD TO DO IT
SAID MR. MORRIS
Commissioner Garfield Required the
Beef Trust's Private Books.
Chicago, Jan. 30. Edward Morris,
vice-president of the Fairbank Canning
company and a member of the firm of
Nelson Morris & Company,
testified today in the packers' case
that he had been required by Commis
sioner Garfield to produce for the in
spection of the commissioner the se
cret profit and loss books of his
company after the commissioner had
prepared his report on the beef indus
try. He further declared that Mr.
Garfield had taken those books and
had inspected them. He told first of
receiving an assurance from the com
missioner that no knowledge that
would be furnished by the packers
would be used against them, of how
he gave the information to the com
missioner and his representatives, and
then declared that Commissioner Gar
field returned to Chicago with the
greater part of his report in proofs,
which he submitted to Mr. Morris.
The witness said that he received
the proofs and told Mr. Garfield that
the report was correct. The Commis
sioner then, the witness asserted, de
manded that the profit and loss books
of the company be brought to the
downtown office of Morris Company
for his inspection. They were brought
and the commissioner looked over
them.
The statement that the commissioner
had called for the secret books after
completing his report caused a stir
in court, but the witness insisted that
he was "required" by Commissioner
Garfield to submit the books to him.
Samuel Roberts, treasurer of Ar
mour & Company, and Chas. G.
Hawes, formerly comptroller of the
treasury and now president of the
Central Trust company of this city,
were witnesses. Both insisted with
much emphasis that they had heard
Commissioner Garfield declare that
any information it might procure
from the packers would not be used
against them.
THE SEA NOT HIGH.
When the Ill-Fated Valencia Went on
the Rocks.
Seattle, Wash., Jan. 30. Today's
session of the investigation into the
loss of the "Valencia." C. A. Allison,
of St. Paul, a passenger, testified that
the sea was not rough. He explained
that he, himself, has been a sailor, that
the surf that finally battered the Va
lencia to pieces could not be called
high.
This testimony caused a mild sensa
tion as all published accounts describ
ed the "high seas" and "terrible surf."

INSURGENTS
SURRENDER
Pacification of the Caucasus Region
The Revolutionists Coming in and
Giving Up on Promise of Immunity
From Punishment.
St. Petersburg, Jan. 30. Alarmed by
the vigorous campaign waged by the
troops under General Alikhanoff, the
inhabitants of the Caucasus are aban
doning the revolutionist cause. They
are coming in by the thousands to
make submission, and are giving up
most abject promises of good conduct
in the future. The campaign against
the active insurgents in the mountains
has thereby been much facilitated. In
many cases the inhabitants themselves
have seized and delivered up the ring
leaders of the insurrection.
In a telegram to the emperor, Count.
Vorontzoff-Dashkoff, viceroy of the
Caucasus, says General Alikhanoff re
ceived one deputation of 8,000 persons
representing twelve communes, near
Kurill. The deputation, which was
headed by nobles and clergymen, prom
ised to stop the disorders, to return all
property and arms seized and to pay
all arrears of rents and taxes if the
general would refrain from punish
ing their people. Another deputation
brought in the participants in the at
tack on the troops at Tengira, bound
with ropes. These participants will be
executed.
In the district of Osurgeti, however,
the viceroy says, "almost the entire
population remains obdurate. One hal
f of the people have fled to the moun
tains and others are roaming the coun
try ravaging it and burning houses."
M'DANIELS PLAY
EXCITES INTEREST
Be Paid $2 for a Marriage License
for no Apparent Purpose.
Murray McDaniel, the man who ap
plied to the probate court for a licensz
to marry Esther Power, could solve a
mystery if he could be located. He Is
regarded as either a curious practical
joker or a lunatic. The Power family
claims to know nothing about the li
cense which McDaniel received and for
which he paid $2. When he first ap
peared at the office of the probate
court and stated that the girl was only
sixteen he was told that he would have
to obtain the consent of her parents or
her legal guardian. He offered to
bring the mother of the girl to court
but was told that that was not neces
sary; that her written consent would
serve the purpose.
He went away and soon returned
with what purported to be the written
consent of Mrs. Power. On the same
sheet of paper he had written his own
name and that of the girl. His chiro
graphy has a good business style.
Both Mrs. Power and her daughter
say they know nothing about the li
cense. They never heard of it until
they read about it in the newspapers.
They know very little more about Mc -
Daniels. He had a room at the Power
residence for a time but he paid no al-
lenuon to the girl then and never
spoke of love or matrimony. The li
cense was issued on January 22, but
at his request was not made public
until the day before yesterday. Since then
he has not been seen.
ATTORNEY ACQUITTED.
Of Charge of Influencing Jurors In Big
Mining Case.
Council Bluffs, Ia., Jan. 30. The
charge of contempt of court against
J. F. Hershey for alleged efforts to in-
fluence jurors in the trial of the $600,
000 Doyle-Burns mining case last
March was dismissed today after three
days spent in hearing testimony.
Judge Thornell held that there was
not enough proof to convict Hershey.
A $10,000 damage suit started by Her
shey against James Doyle was dis
missed. SPEED KING OF THE WORLD.
Ormonde-Daytona Beach, Fla., Jan.
30. Victor DeMogeot, of France, was
crowned speed king of the world this
afternoon on the Daytona sands after
driving his gasoline car two miles in
the marvelous time of 58 4/5 seconds.
DeMogeot maintained a speed of 123
miles an hour to make this record.
THE LITTLE DEAL
OF A STENOGRAPHER
Selling on the Side Reports of the In.
surance Investigation.
Albany, N. Y., Jan. 30. After a de
cidedly lively hearing in which charges
and threats were freely exchanged be
tween Chairman Armstrong of the in
surance investigating committee and
representatives of the Bandow Print
ing company, the state legislative
printers, the senate finance committee
voted to report favorably tomorrow
the bill of Senator Armstrong authoriz
ing his committee to have printed 5,000
copies of the testimony taken in the
insurance investigation at a cost not
to exceed $20,000.
Senator Armstrong made charges of
intentional delays by the printers and
told of an alleged deal between the
committee's stenographer and the state
printer, whereby, he said, the sten
ographer, using the committee's sta
tionery, had sent out 900 circulars of
fering the testimony in printed form
for sale at $150 per set, the stenogra
pher to receive 40 per cent commis
sion. The committee compelled the
cancelling of what orders he had re
ceived. "If we printed 50,000 copies," said
Senator Armstrong, "there would not
be enough to fill the requests, received
by the committee, which have been
coming from all sections of the United
States and from foreign countries as
well."
MURDERED BY A BOMB.
The Chief of Staff of the Viceroy of
the Caucasus.
Tiflis, Caucasus, via St. Petersburg,
Jan. 30. The murder today of General
Grianoff, chief of staff of the Viceroy
of the Caucasus, was most dramatic.
The assassin evidently had studied the
habits of the victim and lay in wait
behind the wall of Alexander garden
opposite the entrance to the palace
where the carriage was drawn up for
the general. The assassin carried a
bomb in a paint can. Impersonating a
workman. As the general stepped into
the carriage the man sprang on the
wall, swung the can by a cord, throw
ing the bomb with marvelous precipita
tion, striking the general on the neck.
Grianoff was blown to pieces together
with the carriage and coachman. The
assassin was captured and probably
will be executed at dawn.
CANFIELD AT HOME.

TOCK MERGER
OLD SPLIT HEALED

The
Seceders Gain
They Contended

Only Those Actively Engaged in Stock Growing are En
titled to Membership Other Matters of Interest to
Stockmen.

Denver, Jan. 30. The consolidation
of the National Live Stock association
and American Stockgrowers associa
tion was effected here today by the
annual conventions of the two organi
zations. The American National Live
stock association is the name adopted
for the amalgamated body, which rep
resents 20,000 stockgrowers, and Mur
do Mackenzie, of Trinidad, Colo., was
unanimously elected president of the
new association by a rising vote in the
joint convention of delegates of the
two old associations.
Mr. Mackenzie has been president
of the American Stockgrowers' asso
ciation since its organization in this
city a year ago by seceders from the
National Livestock association. This
split was caused by the decision to
give representation in the stockmen's
convention to railroads and packers.
In the association organized today,
with which will be affiliated forty
five subsidiary associations, only stock
growers will be represented.
THE GRAZING QUESTION.
A Prospect For the Settlement of the
Controversy.
Denver, Colo., Jan. 30. An impor
tant conference, which may result in
settling the controversy over the ques
tion of using the public lands for graz
ing purposes, was held here today be
tween Gifford Pinchot, chief of the
United States forestry bureau, repre
senting the national government, and
a committee of thirty from the Colo
rado Cattle and Horse Growers' asso
ciation. A plan presented by the stock
men's committee provides a system for
governing the range and met with the
hearty approval of Mr. Pinchot. He
said that already he had put into ef
fect some changes along the lines of
the plan offered, and would make ad
ditional revision when opportunity af-
forded. He told the committee that
the president was determined to carry
out his ideas of leasing the range, and
that in doing so some interests and wel
fare of the stockmen would be given
every consideration.
The plan drawn up by the commit
tee provides for a community rule of
grazing lands, as well as the leasing
of pastures to private individuals. It
favors a long-time lease with a per
manent fee. The community proposi
tion enables a dozen or more owners
of stock to lease acreage and gives
them control through a board made
up of the presidents of the local live-

NATIONAL WOOL GROWERS.
A Proposal For Better Shipping Regu
lations. Denver, Jan. 30. The shopmen
have ideas of their own concerning the
modification of the law requiring cat
tle to be unloaded every twenty-four
hours while in transit. The National
Woolgrowers' association, at its annu
al convention here today, adopted a
resolution favoring a change in the
law making the minimum running
time of trains carrying sheep sixteen
miles an hour. The resolution also
had a clause which proposes a change
enabling the shipper of livestock to
have the unloading done every thirty
six hours, if a request in writing
made to the railroad. The sheepmen
insist that they be not compelled to
unload at night, claiming that it is
difficult to handle sheep in the dark
ness of the night. The changes pro
posed by the resolution referred to
have the sanction of the national hu
mane society.
Another resolution adopted here
favors an increase in the annual ap
propriation for the support of the bu
reau of animal industry from $150,000
to $250,000. A. D. Melvin, chief of the
bureau, and his assistant, G. M. Rom
nell, addressed the convention, telling
of the needs of the bureau. Mr. Rom
nell said that the bureau was planning
to establish an experiment somewhere
in Wyoming to develop an ideal rang
for sheep. This would be done when
sufficient money was in hand for the
project. A committee was appointed
to meet tomorrow with the shipping
law committee of the American Live
stock association. Officers were elect
ed as follows: President, Senator
Francis E. Warren of Cheyenne, Wyo.
re-elected; vice-president for the
west, Dr. J. M. Wilson, of Cheyenne,
Wyo., chief of the state sheep num
mision; vice-president for the east,

retary, George S. Walker, Cheyenne,

commission; treasurer, A. J. Knollin,

FOLLOWING HOUNDS
AFTER A NEGRO
There Were Prospects of a Lynching
in Georgia Last Night.
Atlanta, Ga., Jan. 3. Mrs. Nina
May Dupree, a young woman about
twenty years of age, who lives with
W. H. Grogan, a prosperous farmer,
about six miles from Atlanta, near
Cornell, was assaulted by a negro this
afternoon.
After cutting her throat and leaving
her in a dying condition from loss of
blood and nervous excitement, the ne
gro escaped. A posse of more than a
hundred citizens with hounds is fol
lowing the negro tonight, and if he is
captured he will in all probability be
summarily lynched.
