Mines and Mining

ANOTHER MINE BONDED.
The Connor Group in the Huachucas
Transferred.
On Tuesday an important mining
transfer was made which involved the
bonding of a group of seven mines in
the Huachucas to O. T. Hardy, W. D.
Chapman, O. C. Evans and D. W. Goodrich, says the Tombstone Prospector.
The mines are the well-known group
known as the Connor property and by
the negotiations Peter Connor, the
original locator is made one of the
beneficiaries. The bond covers a period
of one year and upon the signing of the
documents as prepared by Attorney
Charles Bowman, a payment down of
$2,000 cash was made.
This group of mines are located
about twenty-five miles from Tombstone
and is a property which, with the
erection of a modern reduction plant
and the successful treatment of the ore,
can be made a continual producer for
years to come. The property is described
as a mammoth low-grade gold proposition,
practically a quarry of immense
dimensions, acres of surface being
covered with thousands of tons of ore
every ton of which can be worked with
profit by treatment through a mill at the
mines. Numerous tests and assays have
convinced the fortunate new owners that
they have a very desirable property and
will further demonstrate their value by
extensive development which will begin
at once.
Mr. Connor, the original locator, is a
well-known pioneer miner. He labored
for years on his property in its development,
backing his good judgment with
determined effort and is now about to
realize his anticipations and hopes by a
deserving and substantial reward.
SMELTER ENTERPRISE.
A Big Deal Being Promoted by Senator
Clark.
It is reported that the Federal
Smelting Company had sold out its interests
in El Paso and Arizona to a
company organized in New York by W.
A. Clark, the owner of the United Verde
copper mines at Jerome.
The report comes from Col. R. F.
Campbell of El Paso, who, when questioned
by a Times reporter, said:
"On the train coming from the east
the other day I met a Mr. Green of
Arizona. I think he is a miner and
apparently a very particular friend of
Mr. Clark, owner of the big copper
properties at Jerome. On learning that
I was from El Paso Mr. Green informed
me that Mr. Clark had organized a
company with a capital of $3,000,000,
which had purchased of Mr. Jacobs and
his associates their copper mines in
Arizona and their smelter proposition in
El Paso. Mr. Green told me that he was
present at a meeting between Mr. Clark
and the Jacobs people when the deal was
made; and Green gave me to understand
that he knew it was Clark's intention to
establish an immense copper smelting
plant at El Paso. That is all I know
about it. I placed credence in what
Green said because he assured me he
was present when the trade was made,
and he said that Mr. Clark would be in
El Paso in three weeks to arrange for
the erection of the smelter."
A prominent mining man who knows
Mr. Green of Arizona, said to the Times
reporter: "Mr. Green could have no
object in telling Col. Campbell that he
was present when Clark closed a deal for
the Jacobs property if it were not true,
and unless he was present at such a
meeting Green would not have known that
Jacobs had already bought the machinery
for a big coke-furnace smelter, and that
this machinery was included in the deal
with Clark.
"I know that W. A. Clark, who is
now called the copper king, is ambitious
to control the entire copper output of
the southwest. I had a talk with Col.
Campbell and my understanding of
Green's statement is that Mr. Clark has
organized a company with a capital of
three million dollars for the express
purpose of erecting a big copper smelting
plant here.
"In his Jerome property Mr. Clark
has sulphides and the Peabody mine,
which it is alleged he purchased from
Jacobs' company, has the carbonates.
Mr. Clark knows that in addition to
El Paso's present railroad facilities other
roads are coming here, and that
consequently every ton of copper ore
mined in Arizona and New Mexico and
Mexico can be handled right here.
And with plenty of capital to back him
and a plant large enough to handle the
copper output of the southwest, Mr.
Clark can come very near not only
controlling the copper of the west, but
also of controlling the prices. It is a
huge undertaking, but this is an era of
huge undertakings."
MINING NOTES.
Since taking a bond on the Flint
properties near the head of the Hassayampa
and commencing work on them
about June 1, A. J. Pickrell has done
500 feet of development work on the
mines, says the Journal-Miner.
The group consists of the Grosvenor,
Delaware and Trement. Mr. Pickrell
is running a tunnel into the property
and they are showing up very satisfactory.
Development work is being pushed
in the Tremont and Grosvenor mines,
Mount Union.
J. J. Fisher, United States mineral
surveyor, is spending his odd hours
making a map of patented mines in
Yavapai Territory. The map, or plat, will
take in all claims from Jerome to the
Equator. When completed, the map
will be photographed and copies can
be had of Mr. Fisher. Prescott Courier.
A Prescott paper says that J. W.
Nugent is in from Silver Mountain
where he is superintending the development
of several very promising
mining claims.
Superintendent Jones has struck rich
ore in the long tunnel which is being
driven in the Rumor, or Klondyke
claim, which is on the same vein with
the Peterson and Peery claims, says
the Prescott Courier. Mr. Peery has
sold his concentrates to a Mrs. Cook
formerly of Prescott, who is engaged
in mining in Weaver district and has
a force of men employed. Twelve men
are at work on the Leviathan on a
shaft which will strike the ledge at a
depth of 1,000 feet. T. E. Peery has
started to sink a deep well at his station.
He will tunnel from the new well to
the old one, and expects to get enough
water from the two to supply his mining
camp. After he raises the water 100 feet
it will flow by gravity to the mine.
John Teller, representing a San
Francisco company, has proposed to the
people of Kingman that his company
would erect a mill of 100 tons daily
capacity if the citizens would extend to
them certain courtesies. Mr. Teller
stated his proposition to the people,
which was in effect that his company
would mill base ore at a cost not to
exceed $10 per ton and would pay 95
per cent of assay value. The citizens on
their part were to provide a suitable site
and a sufficient volume of water for the
purposes of the mill. This the people
have agreed to do, providing Mr. Teller
on his part agrees that no greater charge
than $10 per ton be made for the treatment
of ore and that 90 per cent or better
be paid for all low-grade ores. Mohave
Miner.
One mining deal closed yesterday
and two others which may be closed
within a few days is not a bad week's
record for Tombstone. Prospector.
E. H. Storrs is in from the Huachucas
today. Mr. Storrs says the Huachucas
are looming up in a mining way and
considerable mining activity is noticeable
throughout the range.
Tombstone Prospector.
Nick Driscoll, a practical miner, returned
today from the Grand Canyon
mine, where he has been at work for
some time. Mr. Driscoll knows a mine
when he sees it, from his long experience
in the business and says the
Grand Canyon is a sure enough one.
Where he was working there was eight
feet of solid copper ore. He says they
cannot secure teams enough to haul the
ore to the railroad. Journal Miner.
WAYS OF GREAT ARTISTS
Holman Hunt's Three Years Search
for the Model for "Scapegoat."
Few pictures have been painted
with such conscientious care as Mr. Luke
Fildes' pathetically beautiful painting,
"The Doctor." The idea of the picture
occurred to the artist long before he
attempted to put it on canvas. The
doctor whom Mr. Fildes was anxious
to introduce into his picture unhappily
died, and the artist had to visualize
him as best he could from memory, assisted
by half a dozen different models.
One sat for the doctor's on one for the
hair, and a third for the grave, earnest
eye. Mr. Val Prince, R.A., sat for the
beard; and Mr. Fildes' own child for the
dying little one. That the picture would
be absolutely true to life Mr. Fildes
actually had the entire cottage built up,
to the smallest detail, in his studio; and
when once the work was begun, in his
own words, "he practically lived with
and for the picture for six months," until
the reward of such minute patience was
in his grasp.
Mr. Holman Hunt, the painter of so
many beautiful pictures, shares nothing
for unconcern in realizing his ideals.
When, in his early years as an artist,
he wished to paint the "Scapegoat," he
took his canvas and paints with him to
the east, wandered hundreds of miles
over deserts and hills, in search of the
goat, the appropriate landscape and
atmosphere for his picture; and at the
end of three years of travel and work
brought back the completed picture to
England only to sell it for less than it
had actually cost him to paint it.
Among continental artists none ever
worked more conscientiously than
Meissonier. Some of whose tiny canvases,
with their microscopic perfection of
detail, are valued at more than $5,000 a
square foot. When Meissonier was
painting his "Napoleon in 1814," and
wished to give a realistic picture of the
snow-covered, trampled road over which
the French army traveled, he had a
small platform made and covered with
clay. He kneaded and pounded the clay,
wheeled over it a miniature cannon, impressed
hoof marks on it, re-kneaded it and
repeated the process until satisfied with
the result. Then he sprinkled salt over the
rutty, hoof-marked, trampled clay,
and got the final snow effect he sought.
Hirosai, the most realistic of Japanese
painters, was cradled in realism.
Even as a child he would haunt the
shores and make sketches of draws and
wrestling bouts. As a boy of 10 he
fished out of a river the severed head of
a drowned man and took it home to
paint; and at 15 he would set up his
easel in front of a blazing fire and
calmly put the flames on his canvas. It
is even on record that one day he chased
two young ladies of high life through the
corridors of a palace simply to sketch,
as he ran, a rare pattern on the silk
which one of them wore.
Vereschagin, whose terrible war
pictures are almost repellent in their
realism, has risked his life many times
while painting them. He would go,
sketchbook in hand, into the thickest of
the fighting, and sketch the falling men
in the intervals of defending himself
from the attacks of the enemy. On one
occasion he had to suspend his painting
for four hours while the bullets rained
around his canvas; and he bears as many
scars as any hero all the fruits of his
love of realism.
Mr. Berkeley, whose battle pictures
are commanding so much admiration,
never trusts to memory or fancy for
his effects. If he wishes to paint mud-
splashed boots he will go for a day's
tramping in the rain, and when he returns
home will take a careful study of the
splashes and reproduce them exactly on
his canvas. Similarly, if he wishes to
paint a tattered garment, he will tear
one into shreds with his own hands; and
he is never content to paint a horse until
he has actually posed one in the desired
attitude.
DRAINING GREAT LAKES
No Visible Change in the Lake Level
When Drainage Canal is Opened.
Some time in November the Chicago
drainage canal will be opened to receive
the water of Lake Michigan and to allow
it to flow through the Illinois river into
the Mississippi. When this event comes
to pass there will be two hundred thousand
in Detroit, Cleveland and other lake
cities nervous lest the lake level shall be
seriously reduced and inaudible commerce
be impeded. Perhaps of a thousand
temperaments will probably pass harrowing
nights on the lake shore, watching for
the water to go down. If it fails to fall
they will suffer a kind of disillusionment,
at least a vexation for they have clearly
predicted that fall must when that
drainage gate is opened.
The outcry against the Chicago
drainage canal, feared now for two or
three years from places all around the
lake, has been provoked partly by local
jealousies, partly by sincere but uninformed
interest, partly by a chronic
tendency in many men to find fault with
strenuous enterprises of any sort.
A few easy figures, presented by able
engineers, show that there is not the
slightest danger that the lakes will empty
themselves into the valley of the Mississippi
and leave their great container
bedded in decaying mud and rubbish.
The St. Clair river carries past Detroit,
from Lake Huron to Lake Erie, 223,000
cubic feet of water per second, yet Lake
Huron holds its own, comparatively.
Over the rock of Niagara 210,000 cubic
feet of the water of Lake Erie rushes
every second toward Lake Ontario, yet
Erie is no diminished, nor are the residents
on its borders nervous lest it will be.
The Chicago drainage canal is so constructed
that, at its greatest flow, it shall
release from Lake Michigan but 10,000
cubic feet of water per second. What is
that beside the mighty but unavailing
expenditure over Niagara? The initial
flow through the drainage canal will be
only 5,000 cubic feet per second, and
this is to be increased only in correspondence
with decided increases in the
population of the drainage district.
Civil Engineer Lyandro E. Cooley, in
the Marine Record, says that a flow of
10,000 cubic feet of water a second
through the Chicago drainage canal
would induce the effect of diminishing
the flow through the St. Clair river 4
per cent. In other words the lake level
may be reduced two to four inches. This
is insignificant in comparison with the
fluctuations of the lakes between high
and low water. In the dry season of late
autumn Lake Michigan is six inches
lower than during the wet season of the
spring, more or less, according to the
character of the season, and still navigation
thrives. It is probable the casual
observer will be unable to note any
change in the lake level when the
drainage canal's flood gate is lifted.

MEN AND WOMEN IN ALL THE VARIOUS
walks of life—professional men, tradesmen,
laboring men, housewives, and
women and men who enjoy a life of leisure—
to all must come sickness and suffering
sooner or later. Nervous Dyspepsia,
Catarrh of the Stomach and Indigestion
are frequently forerunners of the more
serious of stomach disorders, such as
Cancer of the Stomach and Ulceration of
the Stomach. Again, stomach disorders
often lead to serious heart complications.
The great HUDYAN is an infallible
specific for all stomach diseases. Many
people suffer month after month and year
after year with stomach trouble, because
they seek palliatives only; because they
resort to those many pepsin remedies that
have only a temporary effect.
HUDYAN is unlike such remedies, because
it strengthens and stimulates all the
glands concerned in the digestion of food,
and this toning effect is permanent and
lasting.
You may know that serious stomach
disorder is threatening if you suffer with
headaches (Fig. 1), coated tongue and
offensive breath (Fig. 2), pains in shoulder
(Fig. 3), palpitation of heart (Fig. 4),
feeling of heaviness or weight in stomach
or pain in stomach (Fig. 5), pain or ache
in right side over region of liver (Fig. 6).
Liver disorder is a usual complication
of dyspepsia and kindred diseases. There
are other symptoms indicative of stomach
disorder—nervousness, constipation, loss
of appetite, sallow complexion, dizzy spells,
sleeplessness and gaseous eructations.
HUDYAN will cure you. HUDYAN is
an admirable remedy to restore brain
quietude. HUDYAN will overcome
sleeplessness and bad dreams, because it
insures a perfect discharge of the digestive
functions. HUDYAN will cure
constipation, because it strengthens and
stimulates the liver. Men and
