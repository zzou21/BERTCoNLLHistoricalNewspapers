Good news to the many holders of Eruption stock in
Ajo is the word received that the railroad to the mine in
Chihuahua, Mexico was completed last Saturday, and that
in a week or two it will be possible to commence shipping
ore to the El Paso smelter at the rate of 200 tons per day.

EL PASO, Aug. 1.—Means of
bringing 200 tons of ore a day to
the El Paso smelters from the Los
Lamentos mountains in Mexico,
were completed Saturday, when the
last rail of the Chihuahua and
Oriente railroad was placed.
The completion of the road,
which is 50 miles long and connects
the National lines of Mexico with
the property of the Eruption Min
ing Company and the Ahumada
Lead Company, was announced by
C. A. Kinne, El Paso mine oper
ator.
“The El Paso smelter has erect
ed two lead furnaces to take care
of the shipments of ore made pos

said.

supplies will be purchased here to
a large extent.”
Until now, ore has been hauled
in wagons to Lucero, a trip that
made it impossible for mine opera
tion to be effective. The railroad,
which eliminates this wagon haul,
is owned by the two mining com
panies. It has been under con
struction since the first of the year.
It has been reported that rich
ore bodies of lead, running high
in silver values, have been en
countered at the Eruption. The
tonnage in sight exceeding 400,000
tons which would assure about a
six-year run for smelters without
further development work. It is
understood that development work,
however, will be continued. The
ore is a rich lead carbonate, car
rying silver, high in iron content
and very low in silica and in much
demand by the lead smelters. Sev
eral engineers have expressed the
opinion that these properties will
eventually be among the biggest
mines in Mexico.

The force has purchased a Ford road-
ster from Fenner Bros., of Dan’s Gar
age, agent for Ajo.

Hope to Strike
Oil in Arizona
R. E. Leslie of Los Angeles,
was in the city the fore part of
the week en route to Elgin, Santa
Cruz county, motoring, and while
here was a guest at the home of
H. L. Gillespie, being an old
friend of the Gillespie family.
The visitor is president of the
company drilling for oil near Elgin.
The well, spudded in July 2, is
known as Cady No. 1. About 600
people attended the exercises at the
time of spudding in.
Geologists, who have inspected
the field, declare it has all the ear
marks of an oil field, and drilling
to date has resulted in the finding
of formation exactly as predicted,
though at shallower depths than
had been calculated. So at the
present time, hopes for striking oil
at an early date are declared very
bright.
The holding company is known
as the Nogales Oil and Gas Com
pany and the Western Pacific Dril
ling Company is doing the drilling.
In the latter company, it is said
are men connected with Associated
Oil Company, which has been very
successful in the oil fields of Cali
fornia. E. R. Cady is superinten
dent for the drilling company.
Capt. L. W. Mix is president of the
Nogales company, and Bracey Cur
tis, president of the First National
Bank of Nogales, is a director.
