One of the most delightful society
events of the week was the card
party given Friday evening by Mrs.
James S. Griffin. It was in honor
of Mrs. Griffin's guest, Mrs. M. K.
Morin, and a very pleasant evening
was enjoyed by the many attending.
The list of the invited was as follows:
Mrs. Ancil Martin, Mrs. L. K. Hewins, Mrs. W. M. Hefflin, Mrs. A. G. Mullett, Mrs. Owen Galbraith, Mrs.
Ira J. Johnson, Mrs. H. H. McNeil,
Mrs. H. M. Kennedy, Mrs. Selim J.
Nicholson, Mrs. Edward T. Collings,
Mrs. Lloyd H. Christy and Miss
Marion Culver.
Mrs. H. I. Latham and Miss Dixie
George were Prescott visitors, Friday
afternoon.
It is very interesting to note how
rapidly the cottages here are filling
up. At present there are only nine
or ten unoccupied and at the rate
people are arriving, it is doubtful if
there will be any cottages empty by
the time another week has rolled by.
C. V. Wartman spent Friday afternoon in Prescott.
Mrs. S. J. Doster and Mrs. C. K.
Patton spent Friday shopping in Prescott.

There will be no church services on Sunday, owing to Rev. J. P. Jenkins having made a previous engagement for another place. Next Sunday, however, services will be held in the Pavilion. Sunday school will be held as usual.
L. W. Coggins is building a concrete fireplace in his cottage.
Among the husbands who are here
and will spend the week-end with
their families are H. M. Kennedy,
Selim J. Nicholson, E. T. Collings,
Geo. Christy, Aaron Goldberg, Dr.
A. J. Martin, H. I. Latham, C. W.
Wartman, P. M. Goldwater, James S.
Griffin, I. J. Johnson, D. D. Horning
and D. H. Hurtis.
Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Moore, Mrs. Guy
Pennett, Mrs. Ancil Martin, Miss Ruth
Jessop, and Walter and Donny Martin went for a picnic dinner to Flat
Rock, Friday.
A card club is being organized by
the ladies of the camp, to meet every
Saturday afternoon in the Clubhouse.
Membership in the club is open to all
who care to join, and a cordial invi
tation is extended to everyone. The
club had its first meeting Saturday
the 20th.

COLISEUM.
The show at the Coliseum was all
new last night. Wilbur and Harrington,
"Happy Jade" George and the Roma Duo all changed. George has
a new stump speech that is just as
good as the one he had early in the
week. He is ringing in a few local
observations that bring down the
house, as do his remarks on national
affairs. As a stump speaker, George
is undoubtedly the best ever seen in
Phoenix.
Wilbur and Harrington have new
comedy and do new athletic stunts.
The best feature of their changed act
is the "international dance" of Miss
Harrington.
The Roma Duo changed all songs
and costumes. This clever pair has
made a great hit with Phoenix music
lovers.
A special feature has been engaged
for Sunday and Monday nights. This
is a picture of a semi-religious na
ture entitled "John the Baptist." In
the course of the play the Salome
dance is introduced. This picture
created a profound sensation in the
east and in the ordinary course of
events it would not have gotten this
far west before 1912, but Manager
Reeves read of it and nothing would
do him but he must have it. There
fore it will be presented for the en
tertainment of patrons of the Coli
seum for two nights only.
As for next week's bill, it looks
good from this distance. The head
liners are expected to be Kingsbury
and Munson who have a unique and
thrilling act entitled "The Devil In
Possession." This little playlet is in
deed a thriller, and also conveys a
deep moral lesson.
Urowder and Rrowder, the second
attraction, are German comedians,
singers and dancers. This is said to
be one of the highest class German
acts now playing western time.
"Texas George" is coming with a
novelty shooting act. He is alone
and is said to be a wizard with the
rifle. There may be shooters who
can hit as well as he can but they
have not his novelties.
The Canova quartet was announced
for a week or two ago, but its en
gagement at the Coliseum was post
poned because of the illness of Harry
Madden. Mr. Madden has practically
recovered and these young men will
positively appear Friday, Saturday,
Sunday and Monday nights.

MAKES HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.

An important meeting of the council
of the Water Users' association was
called yesterday for the purpose of
reducing the penalty of delinquent
members. Originally this penalty
was placed at four per cent, dating
from the time of the ordering of the
sale of the delinquent property. This
rate was regarded too excessive and
was reduced to two per cent. That
has seemed a little stiff so that it
was further proposed to reduce it
to one per cent, the penalty to attach
as soon as the property becomes
delinquent.
There had been some misunderstanding as to the status of the various delinquents at the present time and it was urged that it would be unfair to make this reduction in favor of those who are yet delinquent while the benefit of the reduction would not go to those who had already paid.
But it has been explained that in
as much as there has been no order
for the sale of any property, all
would be equally affected by the re
duction. However, nothing was done in the
matter yesterday as a quorum of the
council could not be secured.
The board of governors, though,
transacted some business in awarding
the contract for the work on the
Cross-cut to Grant Pros. There are
about 160,000 yards of excavation to
be made. The prices to be paid, ac
cording to the contract are as fol
lows: for earth, cents a yard; for
loose rock, cents; for solid rock, cents.

St. Paul intends to be on the musical map of the nation this
year. Mrs. Frederick Snyder, who manages the St. Paul grand opera season,
has been busy during the last few
weeks securing a guarantee fund of
$50,000 which is necessary to secure
the appearance of the Chicago opera
company here for a week during the
coming winter. She has already been
successful in raising $30,000 and hopes
to have the fund completed by the
middle of next week and the season
assured.
The Symphony Orchestra, supported
by popular subscription at a cost of
about $25,000 per year, will have eleven
concerts during the year and intends
to bring many of the most noted art
ists of the country here as feature attractions.

New People Every Week

SAVOY

Using a locomotive engine to ex
tinguish the flames in a burning
building is a new departure in Lindaborg,
but this is what happened here.
On the outskirts of the city a
Mexican hut situated about thirty
to forty feet from the Missouri tracks
caught fire, and being out of reach
of the fire department it became the
duty of the man nearest the blaze,
at least to make an attempt to put
out the fire.
The Missouri Pacific's engine was
standing idle on the tracks and had
on plenty of steam. The engineer
saw the fire and steamed up to a
point opposite the burning building,
turned on all his steam, and blew
out the fire in a few minutes. The
steam smothered the fire.

THE GERM WHICH PRODUCES
DANDRUFF

Finally Causes Baldness. Kill the
Germ and Save Your Hair.
Newbro's Herpicide Will
Do It.

Did you ever try to discover a reason
for the dying of a valuable plant?
You perhaps found that life was de
stroyed by some insect or parasite
working about the roots and sapping
away the elements which go to sup
port plant life.
The dandruff germ exercises the
same destructive influence upon the
life of the hair. It forces its way
down the follicle around the hair
bulb and thus prevents the hair from
getting proper nourishment. The hair
dies and drops out.
Newbro's Herpicide prevents this
by killing the germ. It also frees the
scalp from the accumulations of dirt
and scarf skin. With the removal of
these obstacles to a clean, healthy
scalp, the hair will grow naturally
and luxuriantly.
Herpicide is known as the Original
Dandruff Germ Destroyer.
One dollar size bottles are sold and
guaranteed by all druggists.
Applications may be obtained at
the better barber shops and hair
dressing parlors.
Send 10c in postage or silver to The
Herpicide Co., Dept. R, Detroit, Mich., for a neat sample of Herpicide and a
booklet telling all about the hair.
