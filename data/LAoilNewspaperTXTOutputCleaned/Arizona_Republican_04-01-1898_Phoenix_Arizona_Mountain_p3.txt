THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN; FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 1, 1898.

Over Arizona!
Mr. Pittock of The Republican, who
has been in Tucson for a couple of
days, left last night for Casa Grande
and Yuma. He will doubtless have
something nice to say of the ancient
and honorable pueblo. Star.
Manuel Bruno, who was recently
sentenced to a term in the territorial
prison for horse stealing, was taken
to Yuma Tuesday night says the Star.
This is Bruno's third trip from Pima
county and he has been sentenced once
or twice from other counties.
Assessor Harwood has been in town,
says the Willcox News, engaged in a
meritorious effort to awaken in the
property owners of that town a realization of their wealth. He reports that

thus far he has been able to return
property largely in excess of last
year's showing.
The school election at Willcox last
Saturday resulted in the choice of Mr.
Kasper Hauser to succeed himself. The
impression prevailed that there was
an opposition candidate but the sup
posed competitor announced that he
did not want the office and himself
voted for Mr. Hauser, making his elec
tion almost unanimous.
It is reported that Col. Breathitt will
be a candidate for Congress before the
next democratic territorial convention.
Mark Smith's friends, however, expect
a renomination of their chief. In ad
dition to the two already named there
will, it is said, be a number of other
empty honor seekers. Tucson Citi
zen. Nogales has a new paper, "The Taxpayer." The Tucson Citizen says The
Vidette had been the taxpayers' organ
but it flopped and now as ardently
supports the Greater Nogales ticket as
it did the taxpayers. The Taxpayer
has been born to fill the newly felt
want. Its life will, we presume, de
pend largely upon the success of its
ticket, but be that as it may the first
issue is vigorously edited.
For some time past Judge Thomas
A. Borton has been the only member
of the Borton family able to be about,
his father, mother and sister all being
bedfast. This, by the way, was the
first time in his life that Mr. Borton
had ever been sick for longer than a
day. The Star is glad to be able to
note that all three of the sick ones are
now improving, and all hope to be well
again in a few days. Tucson Star.
A. Salazar was fined $5 today by
Judge Connell for driving over the
hose of the fire company yesterday.
This habit appears to be a common one
and was indulged in liberally yester
day, and instead of one arrest it is
probable that a half dozen ought to
have been made. The city fire hose
cost $800 and the quickest way to ruin
it is by driving wagons over it when
stretched across the street and full
of water. Tucson Citizen.
Died, at his home on Oak creek,
Yavapai county, March 26, 1898, James
Allen, a native of Illinois, aged 63
years. He leaves a wife and six chil
dren, the oldest about 14 years. De
ceased was familiarly known as
"Broncho Jim" Allen, and was a stockman
with a host of friends. He was
a pensioner of the war of the rebellion
and had been a resident of the Verde
valley for twenty years. A good citi
zen has gone. Peace to his ashes.

The movement inaugurated in Phoe
nix to secure adequate representation
of territorial products at the Omaha
exposition should receive hearty sup
port. The resources of Arizona are
great and varied, but so long as they
remain unknown to capital they will
lie undeveloped and unproductive.
The proposed exposition will undoubt
edly eclipse anything in that line since
the world's fair and the money devoted
to an appropriate exhibit of our pro
ductions will be well expended. Will

Hon. C. D. Hoover a few days ago
received a letter from a brother-in-law
who has spent several years in Aus
tralia, where he has been largely in
terested with other gentlemen in the
raising of high grade horses. Not
long ago they sent to this country for
three Kentucky horses, for which they
paid $14,000. He writes from Christchurch, New Zealand, where he had
gone to attend the "county fair." He
says there was a great crowd present,
and that the exhibits and the races
compare favorably with those in the
states. Tucson Star.
For the past few days a big fire has
been raging in the Whetstone moun
tains and it is thought several thou
sand acres of timber and dry grass
have been consumed high up in the
mountains, while from present appear
ances it does not seem as if the flames
are subsiding; on the contrary, a larg
er area is gradually being destroyed,
the general course being toward the
top of the mountain. Although the
fire is about forty miles from Tomb
stone it can plainly be seen, espec
ially at night, and by the aid of a
glass its progress can be noted. The
fire has been burning for three days,
having evidently started at the base
of the mountain, but has now worked
its way well toward the top and is still
burning. Tombstone Prospector.
A big robbery took place Saturday
night last at the ranch of Mr. Sabino
Otero near Tubac. Mr. Otero is a well
known cattleman, is well off in this
world's goods, which he uses with a
generous hand to help along those less
fortunate. This fact, however, did not
deter thieves breaking into his storeroom and robbing him while he was
away from home. The storeroom is
some little distance from the house,
but the robbing was done by somebody familiar with the premises. A
team had been employed to transport
the goods. It had been left some
distance from the house and the sto
len property carried to it. The parties
who did the work had their feet tied
up in gunny sacks. Mr. Otero's loss is
about $500. Tucson Citizen.
On March 30 and April 2 tickets will
be on sale via the Southern Pacific
company at Phoenix, Mesa City and
Tempe, to Salt Lake City and return,

of $59.70. Return limit good sixty days.

VALUABLE ADVICE TO SHIPPERS.

Kansas Department of Agriculture
Furnishes the Facts.
In the preparation of the quarterly
report of the Kansas board of agri
culture devoted to "The Beef Steer,"
Secretary F. D. Coburn aimed to not
only secure the views of those who
are masters in beef production but also
avail himself of observations by others
among those who deal with the stock
when it reaches the market.
None have a keener eye for the mer
its and defects of the beef animal,
both as to his individual quality, con
dition and the treatment given him at
home and on his way to market, than
the salesman who receives, cares for
and sells him to the slaughterer or
shipper. From the counsel given by
one of the most extensive livestock
commission firms, the following ex
cellent advice for every feeder and
shipper is given, and is the result of
very extensive experience and wide
observation. They say:
In the first place a large majority
of the feeders make a mistake in hold
ing fat cattle that are ready for mar
ket; for instance a man is feeding 100
to 150 head of steers, and there are,
say, one-half or two-thirds of the cat
tle that are fat and could be shipped
at any time. Very few men will ship
them out, for the simple reason that
all their cattle are not ready, and they
hold on to the good ones until the
entire bunch is ready. We are con
tinually advising our customers to
ship out all fat cattle as fast as ready.
By doing so, they divide their risk.
The cattle that are left have a better
chance to improve, and there is more
profit to be made in this way, on ac
count of the small margin there is in
keeping matured steers, as this class
of cattle make little gain compared
with half fat steers.
Another mistake that is made is in
shipping cattle off grass. We have
had a number of instances where our
customers have shipped cattle that
were fed on the grass without putting
them in a dry lot for a day or two be
fore shipment and feeding nothing but
corn, oats and hay, and by not doing
so, the cattle on arrival look grassy, their hair looks shiny, they shrink al
most double what they would if han
dled in the proper way, and they don't
sell within 10 to 15 cents per hundred
(and in some cases more) of cattle
that are put in a dry lot and fed noth
ing but corn, hay and oats for a short
time before shipment.
Overloading is a very bad feature,
but we are not troubled as much, in
this respect, as we were before the
charge of freight by cents per 100
pounds became established. A little
advice on this subject is still quite
necessary, as we have customers fre
quently who overload their cattle, and,
as a result, they make extra shrink
age; they do not look as well at mar
ket, which, as you are aware, affects
the sale fully 10 cents per hundred
pounds; this means a direct loss to
the shipper of 10 cents per hundred,
and the extra shrinkage, which is
quite a large item, that could be saved
with proper management.
The best investment a shipper ever
made was in putting extra good bed
ding in his cars. This is a point which
should be well looked after, as it
means a big saving from loss of pos
sibly dead or crippled cattle, as well as
the shrinkage. We think another
point that could be well covered would
be, where parties are shipping stock,
to classify it as much as possible. In
this way the cars are more evenly
loaded, the stock ships much better,
and it also saves considerable delay
upon arrival here. The work of sort
ing and shaping stock at this end is
a very small item, but by classifying
the stock in the country it means
economy of time at the market. Cattle
handle better if they do not get too
much water just before shipment. The
golden rule in shipping all kinds of
cattle is to get them as quickly as pos
sible from range, ranch, farm or feed
yard to market. Notably is this the
case with rangers. It has been proven
time and again that a range bullock
shrinks every hour after he leaves his
native haunts. It stands to reason
that all cattle will do so, but natives
do not fret nor are they liable to get
so bruised as the former.
Grass cattle, as a rule, do not ship
well. On the pasture they look well,
and many a buyer has been deceived
by the appearance of a drove of steers
in a grass field with a full bite. To
ship such cattle is a hard task, and
is invariably disappointing, but it has
to be done. Where convenient, it is a
good plan to place such cattle in a
pen and feed them hay for a day or
two. The secret of shipping all classes
of cattle is to place them on the cars
full of feed, but with as little moisture
as possible. If you ship a steer full
of water he is apt to have loose bow
els and show up in the yards badly.
Properly handled cattle should arrive
in the sale pens dry behind, and ready
for a good fill of water; not over-thirsty,
but in good condition to water
freely.
Many of our shippers think that by
salting their cattle, or by feeding
them oats, or by other scheming, they
can fool the buyers. This is nonsense.
The buyers are just as sharp as the
owner, and while many of them say
nothing, you often see them ride into
a pen and out again without the
courtesy of a bid, on this account.
Dozens of times we have seen this
happen. It always acts against the
shipper to use unnatural means. To
eastern buyers it is a matter of great
importance that cattle should be in
good condition when purchased, so as
to stand further shipment. When cat
tle shrink too freely they are apt to
founder and break down. In this con
dition the dressed beef man can use
them, but it stops competition, and as
a natural consequence, cattle often go
below their value when in this condi
tion. The same rule applies to grain-fed
cattle, whether in pasture or dry lot,
as to the above. Only they are much
more easily handled in shipment, and
do not show much distress in their
changed circumstances. As to feed on
the road, nothing equals good, sweet
hay. It beats corn or other grains,
because it is easily digested and does
not fever the animal. Simple meth
ods and simple feed are the best that
can be used. As to water on the road,
it is a matter to be decided on accord
ing to the weather. In midsummer

care must be taken to supply animal
wants, whereas in winter a steer can
go many hours without a drink. Good
management in this line also calls for
the arrival of stock at the yards in

proper time. From 5 to 8 a. m. is the
best time in the day to appear upon
the scene; the nearer the latter hour
the better for cattle. They always look
better when they are taken off the cars
and have just been fed and watered.
Then they have a bloom upon them,
which wears off very quickly.
Many feeders would be saved both
disappointment and loss if before
sending in cattle to market they would
notify their commission house what and when they are going to ship. Then,
if the commission merchant thinks the stock would be benefited by longer
feeding, or that the prospect is un
favorable for the time the feeder ex
pects to have his cattle in, he can
so advise his client and thus save him
from sacrificing his stock or getting in
at the wrong time. Especially is this
important in November or the begin
ning of winter, when we are getting
half-fat cattle that ought to have been
held back thirty or sixty days longer
at least. No doubt many of these
look all right in the feed lot and ap
pear to have good finish, but not hav
ing matured or ripened they practi
cally "go to pieces" on the cars, and
in addition to loss through heavy
shrinkage the owner has to accept a
low price on the market. We wish
every stockman would follow out this
plan of giving notice a day or so ahead
of the time he expects to ship. It
works both to the advantage of the
shipper and seller. The latter, being
on the market every day, knows just
what the market wants and can judge
pretty closely of near prospects. He
is thus able to give his client the nec
essary advice and information he
should have before he sends in his
stock.
THEY RIDICULE IT.
Many People Ridicule the Idea of an
Absolute Cure for Dyspepsia and
Stomach troubles. Ridicule, however,
is not argument and facts are stubborn things.
Stomach troubles are so common
and in many cases so obstinate to
cure that people are apt to look with
suspicion on any remedy claiming to
be a radical, permanent cure for dys
pepsia and indigestion. Many such
pride themselves on never being hum
bugged, especially on medicines.
This fear of being humbugged may
be carried too far; so far, in fact, that
many persons suffer for years with
weak digestion, rather than risk a little
time and money in faithfully testing
the claims of a preparation so re
liable and universally used as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one important re
spect from ordinary proprietary med
icines for the reason that they are not
a secret patent medicine, no secret is
made of their ingredients, but analysis
shows them to contain the natural di
gestive ferments, pure aseptic pepsin,
the digestive acids, Golden Seal, bis
muth, hydrastis and nux. They are
not cathartic, neither do they act
powerfully on any organ, but they
cure indigestion on the common sense
plan of digesting food eaten promptly,
thoroughly before it has time to fer
ment sour and cause the mischief.
This is the only secret of their suc
cess. Cathartic pills never have and never
can cure indigestion and stomach trou
bles because they act entirely upon
the bowels, whereas the whole trouble
is really in the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, taken
after meals, digest the food. That is
all there is to it. Food not digested
or half digested is poison, as it cre
ates gas, acidity, headaches, palpita
tion of the heart, loss of flesh and ap
petite, and many other troubles which
are often called by some other name.
They are sold by druggists every
where at 50 cents per package. Ad
dress Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich., for
book on stomach diseases or ask your
druggist for it.
APRIL.
I come like a hope to a gloomy breast,
With comforting smiles, and tears
Of sympathy for the earth's unrest:
And news that the summer nears,
For the feet of the young year every
day
Patter and patter and patter away.
I thrill the world with a strange de
light; The birds sing out with a will,
And the herb-lorn lea is swift bedight
With cowslip and daffodil;
While the rain for an hour or two
every day
Patters and patters and patters away.
I sing of love, and my strains console
The wish of the wak'ning mind,
And their echoes roll from soul to soul,
And grow on my murmurous wind;
And hearts with a true-love every day
Patter and patter and patter away.

April Pall Mall Magazine.
