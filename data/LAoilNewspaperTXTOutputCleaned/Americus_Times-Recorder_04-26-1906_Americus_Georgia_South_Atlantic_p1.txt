STRUCK WITH AXE
WOMAN IS SLAIN
Mrs. Mollie Glover Found Dead
In Bed.
MURDER SHROUDED IN MYSTERY
The Woman Was Struck with the Ax
Probably Twenty Times—Police
Have No Clue to Guilty Party—Cyl
Luttrell Held on Suspicion.
Bristol, Tenn., April 25. —Mrs. Mollie
Glover, a woman 30 years of age,
was found dead in her bed at the
home of Cyl Luttrell on Second street
shortly after midnight Wednesday
morning with her head split open and
almost severed from the body. A
large bloody ax found lying under the
bed told the story.
The murder was committed about 11
o’clock, and is shrouded in mystery,
though Cyl Luttrell has been arrested
and is in jail on suspicion. He is
about 57 years of age, and an old em
ployee of the Norfolk and Western Rail
way company.
Luttrell, who was working Tuesday
night, claimed that he left the house
about 9 o’clock, and locked the door
and on returning about 11 o’clock
found the door as he had left it, and
entering, found the bed coverings com
pletely over Mrs. Glover, and things
in a disturbed condition about the
room. He says he raised the cover
and the ghastly sight of the woman ly
ing in a pool of blood with the bed
clothing completely saturated, met his
eyes and he ran.
Late Reporting the Murder.
Luttrell did not report the murder
for an hour, and when arrested was
very nervous and told what the police
regard as flimsy tales of the circum
stances leading up to the murder.
It is believed that the woman was
at Luttrell's house for immoral pur
poses. Luttrell has a wife and large
family of grown children.
The police say his past reputation
in this respect has been shady, and
they do not doubt but that the rela
tions of Luttrell and Mrs. Glover were
intimate and she came to his house
to stay during the night.
The woman was struck with the
ax probably twenty times, and the po
lice have no clue to the guilty party.
Mrs. Glover had a refined appear
ance, and was considered good looking.
Cotton Manufacturers Assemble.
Boston, April 25. —The fourth annual
meeting of the New England Cotton
Manufacturers’ association assembled
Wednesday at the Massachusetts In
stitute of technology for a two days’
session. The presence of a commis
sion representing prominent English
spinners who have come to this coun
try to investigate the growing of cot
ton and other questions connected with
the raw material, was one of the feat
ures of the convention. Among the
important matters to be passed upon
was a proposition favored by the board
of rules to change the name of the as
sociation to the National Cotton Man
ufacturers.
Lost Architects Heard from.
New York, April 25. —August O.
Hoddick, an architect of this city, and
his brother Arthur Hoddick, of Buffa
lo, N. Y., who, it had been feared, had
been lost at sea while making from
Charleston, S. C., to Norfolk, Va., In
a naphtha launch, have been heard
from at Southport, N. C. A heavy
gale threw their launch upon the coast
almost directly on the boundary line
between North and South Carolina, and
the occupants were almost without
food for a week.
Men Fought Like Beasts.
Warsaw, Russian Poland, April 25. —
Religious frenzy characterized the
fighting at Lesnos on April between
Catholic and Mariavite women ten per
sons were killed and 77 were wound
ed. Four priests were terribly mu
tilated. The men fought like beasts.
The antagonists gouged out the eyes
of their adversaries. The Catholics,
who were beaten, threaten to arrange
a St. Bartholomew massacre.
Prepare for Strikers.
Paris, April 25. —According to a
semi-official statement made by a high
functionary of the prefecture of police,
the military and police are prepared to
meet every eventuality May 1st. He
said the police canvass shows that 80,-
000 men have stopped work, of which
number the disorderly element does
not exceed 20,000.

Irritation
of the throat, sore and swollen

WIZARD OIL
used as a gargle, and externally
on the throat, is a marvelous rem

ous disorders, and effects relief
and cure after everything else

Says Henry Wade, of Harlin,
Mo.: “I am under obligations to
you for the great good which
Hamlins Wizard Oil did my wife.
She suffered from Throat Trouble
for a year, and though she doc

her any good, until she tried Ham

LABORERS SLAY A FOREMAN.
Fitzgerald Meets Death at Hands of
Italians.
Roanoke, Va., April 25. —J. H. Fitz
gerald, a well known railroad con
tractor of Huntington, W. Va., was
shot and stabbed to death Tuesday
near Curve, Giles county, Va., by a
gang of Italian laborers. Fitzgerald’s
slayers escaped immediately after
committing the crime and are being
pursued in the mountains by sheriff
Durham and a posse.
If captured they will be taken to
the Giles county jail at Pearisburg.
Fitzgerald was a member of the
contracting firm of Millet and Fitz
gerald and went alone Tuesday to in
spect some work on the new Tide
water railroad. There were no wit
nesses to the crime except twelve
Italians, all of whom took to the woods
after the killing. Fitzgerald was shot
twice in the head by bullets of dif
ferent caliber and was stabbed in
the back and abdomen.
There has been a great deal of
trouble of late along the new road
with Italian laborers.
Texas Holds Henry Seigler.
Augusta, Ga., April 25. —Habeas cor
pus proceedings instituted in Johnson
county Texas, has brought to a stand
still the case of Henry Seigler, charg
ed with kidnapping. The Seigler case
is familiar. For some time past the
man has been wanted in Augusta for
kidnapping his own child. Several
weeks ago he was located in Texas,
identified, and arrested by the local
authorities. Requisition papers were
taken out, and Officer Stafford was
deputized to bring the prisoner to
Augusta. He was expected to return
last week, but before he could obtain
custody of his man, Seigler’s attor
neys in Texas began the habeas cor
pus proceedings. Constable Stratford
will remain in Johnson county until
a decision is reached.
Bank in Examiner's Hands.
Gadsden, Ala., April 25.—Federal
Bank Examiner Silas H. L. Cooper,
has taken charge of the First Nation
al Bank of Attalla, and has closed its
doors. The only information to be
had is that the examiner has taken
charge and closed the doors. It is
understood the action was taken on
orders from the comptroller of the
currency in Washington. It is said
the bank is only temporarily embar
rassed and will be able to resume. L.
M. Dykes is president and some of the
leading business men of Attalla are
directors. The capital stock is $25,-
000. It is believed that the statement
of the bank up to April 6 caused the
investigation which led to suspension.
Girl’s Assailant Slain by Father.
Grosbeck, Tex., April 25. —While
being conveyed to jail in the custody
of two officers, a negro, who, it is
alleged, assaulted the daughter of J.
A. Eastland, a farmer of Delta, at an
early hour Tuesday morning, was
taken from the officers by a posse of
citizens and held until the arrival of
the girl’s father. When Eastland rode
up he ordered the crowd to stand
back and he emptied both barrels of
his shotgun, loaded with buckshot,
into the negro killing him instantly.
There is no excitement.

Angry Strikers Surround Plant.
Kenosha, Wis., April 25.—Offers by

WORK OF RESTORATION
ALREADY UNDER WAY
Plans For Reconstruction Are
Being Rapidly Drawn.
NEW CITY TO BE GREATER ONE
Streets Are Being Cleared for Traffic
Numerous Street Car Lines Ready
For Operation, and Rapid Headway
is Being Made in Repairing Mains.
San Francisco, April 25. —It was a
week Wednesday since this city was
visited by an earthquake, which laid
low the metropolis of the Pacific coast
and started a conflagration unequalled
in the history of this country.
Although the ruddy glow of the dy
ing embers of the great fire still night
ly illuminate the sky, the work of
restoration is already well under way.
Plans for the construction of the
new buildings to replace those destroy
ed by earthquake and flames are rap
idly being drawn and work on some
of them will begin as soon as the ruins
of the old buildings are cold. Many
of the new planned buildings are on a
larger scale than those licked up by
the flames, giving promise that from
the ashes will rise a new San Francis
co, greater and more beautiful than
the old.
In addition to the large force of men
and teams already at work, about 50
teams of government mules were put
to work Tuesday hauling away the
debris. Several more streets were
cleared for traffic, numerous street car
lines are ready for operation, while the
repairing of the water mains and the
work of restoration of the gas and
electric systems is making rapid head
way. Work on taking down and re
building the ferry tower began Wed
nesday.
The exodus from the city continues.
All day Tuesday a constant stream of
men, women and children, afoot and
on every conceivable vehicle, wended
their way down Market and Mission
streets toward the ferries.
A little bundle on a stick carried
over the shoulder represented all the
worldly possessions of some; others
had grips, and baskets, and a great
thank had saved trunks and furniture.

Typical Scene in Concentration Camp.
It is estimated that 65,000 people
were furnished with free transporta
tion to the different parts of the state
by the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific
railways.
The relief work is now thoroughly
organized, and is rapidly becoming to
be systematized.
The rain was followed by a cooler
atmosphere, which caused some suf
fering.
Many people walked for hours to
keep warm; others huddled around
little camp fires, shivering with cold,
in some instances their clothing being
still wet from the rain. Everything
possible was done to alleviate their
distress by putting women and chil
dren in houses, but as no fires were al
lowed, and there is a lack of blankets,
it helped but little.
As a result of Mayor Schmitz sharp
letter to General Koster, commanding
the national guard in which the may
or calls the general’s attention to the
fact that the city was not under mar
tial law, and that the drastic meas
ures and arbitrary actions of some of
his men which have caused so much
complaint, were illegal and requesting
him to put a stop to it, there was but
little shooting Tuesday night in the
district over which the militia holds
sway.
A marine reported having found a

old ones, too. The next time you see your doctor, ask him why this medicine
so promptly relieves coughs.

someone rummaging in a house on Fillmore
street after 10 o’clock Tuesday night
and a sentry shot through the window.
A looter who broke into several places
in Yalejo street, is reported to have
been shot by a marine sentry.
An alleged thief, who is said to have
jumped out of a window with a bun
dle of clothing at Pierce and O’Far
rell streets early Wednesday morning,
is reported to have been shot by a
national guardsman.
The fact that two companies of the
Fourteenth United States infantry from
Vancouver went to Oakland to do
guard duty in that city, indicates that
the militia will be relieved.
Three Bodies Found in Ruins.
San Francisco, April 25.—The bod
ies of three men and one woman were
found among the ruins in the burned
district Tuesday. One of them, which
is identified as that of John Hynes,
was found at Eighteenth and Kentucky
streets. Hynes met death by drown
ing. The remains of another man
were found in the ruins of the South
ern Pacific building, and those of an
other at 552 First avenue. The body
of the woman was found at Sixth and
Townsend streets. None of the three
could be identified.
El Paso Filled with Refugees.
El Paso, Tex., April 25. —El Paso
bids fair to become overrun with San
Francisco refugees. Every train is
bringing many penniless refugees, the
relief committee furnishing them free
transportation. It may be necessary
to raise funds to help them. The
Maccabees started a movement Tues
day among all the Texas lodges of
that order to assist the San Francisco
members of the order. The fund will
be sent to the camp commander.
Railroads Lose $2,000,000.
New York, April 25.—Patrick Cal
houn, president of the United railroads
of San Francisco, Tuesday received a
telegram from George H. Davis, in
charge of the engineering department
of the United railroads of San Fran
cisco, stating that the Bryant street
electric power station was in full op
eration, and that the total general loss
to all physical property of the railroad
company is about $2,000,000.
Y. M. C. A. To Aid.
New York, April 25.—An appeal to
the Y. M. C. A. to contribute at least
$20,000 at once for emergency work
among the young men of San Fran
cisco and the mechanics who go there
to take part in the rebuilding of the
city, was issued Tuesday.
21 Warehouses Saved.
New Orleans, April 25. —Many in
quiries from eastern shippers as to
warehouse facilities at San Francisco,
have been received here by the secre
tary of the American Warehouse as
sociation. No information was avail
able until Tuesday, when Mr. Reid,
the secretary, received a letter under
date of April 21 from President Has
lett, of the Haslett Warehouse com
pany, of San Francisco, which states:
“The warehouse districts at both ends
escaped and only the houses in the
center are gone. Twenty-one ware
houses are saved, eighteen lost.”
Oil Did Not Suffer.
Los Angeles, April 25.—California’s
oil has not suffered from the earth
quake in the southern part of the
state. This is the statement of the
officials of the various petroleum com
panies.
Will Take Charge of Property.
Sacramento, Calif., April 25. —Secre-
tary Metcalf, of the department of com
merce and labor, passed through here
Tuesday night on his way to San Fran
cisco, to take charge of United States
properties and buildings as special
commissioner from the president and
representing the president in this mat
ter. He was accompanied by Con
gressman McKinley, who announced
he would at once proceed to Santa
Rosa.
Lost Valuable Manuscripts.
Sacramento, Calif., April 25.—Mr. R.
A. Crothers, proprietor of the San
Francisco Bulletin, arrived in Sacra
mento Tuesday night. He said he
lost everything in his home at 106
Bush street, where were collected a
valuable mass of manuscripts and other
articles belonging to the late Mr. Lo
ring Pickering. Among those was the
manuscript of a historic journalism by
Mr. Pickering. Most of the files of the
Bulletin were saved, and those lost can
be replaced.
1,500 Tons of Supplies
Tacoma, Washington, April 25. — The
United States cable ship Burnside sail
ed from Tacoma Tuesday night, direct
for San Francisco, with a full cargo
of 1,500 tons of supplies purchased by
the chamber of commerce relief com
mittee from local contributions and
from funds telegraphed from Philadel
phia, Boston and other cities.
Not for Strangers.
“What in the world does that mean?”
asked the traveler through a sparsely
settled region on the cape. “There’s
no such place on my road map.”
The man whom he addressed first
took a leisurely survey of the traveler
and his horse and then turned his eyes
toward the weather beaten sign which
bore the single word “Tolpim.”
“That ain’t a name,” he said, with
dignity; “it’s just an indication. It
means, ‘To Long Pond one mile.’
“It’s plain enough to folks from near
by that’s hunting for the pond, and
we don’t reckon on strangers taking
much interest.”—Youth’s Companion.
Ambition.
It is the perpetual effort to attain the
ideal that enlarges the whole life. The

or tends to become sordid or selfish the
individual begins to "shrivel.—Success
