THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN. TUESDAY MORNING, JULY 4, 1899.

Two daily newspapers in San Fran-
cisco have joined the issue. Those who pretend to see state and fed-
eral opposition to organized labor in the present restrictions imposed at
Wardner, Idaho. The distinction is
clear and well understood everywhere.
There is no state or federal fight
against organized labor in Idaho. The
only ones that are hurting the cause
of organized labor there are the men
who are guilty of arson and as-
sassination, and who deserve the pun-
ishment meted out to such malefactors
everywhere. Organized labor has just
the same rights as organized capital,
in some cases superior rights and priv-
ileges, and the drastic measures now
in application in the Coeur d'Alene
country are not an menace nor an at-
tack, but a protection. The state and
federal authorities are not fighting the

great "copper queen vein"; this is one of
the eastern schemes which anxiously
seeks to exchange its stock for the eastern
hard dollar. No confidence men.

N. P. McCallum, proprietor of
Phoenix Foundry and Machine
Works of Phoenix, Arizona, has fur-
nished D. S. Gray, for his gravel
plant, California, a complete stamp
mill, rock crusher and sampling plant. The two mills
purchased from the Union Iron
Works of San Francisco.

WHAT JESUS WOULD NOT DO

Paragraphs That Are Attracting
the Attention.

Under the "What Jesus Would
Not Do" paragraphs from Eng-
lish religious press.

He would not make "getting on"
or "getting on" the goal of his
efforts.
He would not wish to enjoy any-
thing which was not the result of
his own joyful gift of
labor nor the loving
gift of others.
He would not wear gold nor jewels
as though the lilies and birds
his Father cares for to be recklessly
slaughtered to deck him with feathers
and furs.
He would still live without wealth,
seeking immunity from want only in trusting
his Father's care for innocent and
helpless animals.
He would not join amusements which profane the hours
and minds of those who
engaged.
He would not waste food or fuel
while others are perishing for need
of them. He would not trail yards of
costly fabric along the ground behind
him.
Jesus would not earn his bread by
following any employment or produc-
ing any material injurious to the
moral or physical being
of humanity.
He would not secure for relatives "after the flesh"
any appointment or honor of which they were not
worthy, or of which others were more
worthy. Jesus would not underpay
or overwork strangers in order to pro-
vide for the idleness or luxury of his
own kinsmen or dependents.
He would not condone faults or vices
in the wealthy and powerful.
Jesus would not, in times of popular
excitement, write false and fiery ar-
ticles in the papers by which passions
are fanned into fury and wars are
inspired by children's stories
of battle, murder and violent
death.
He would not hold himself excused whose whole
charity was of the lips only; whose
charity.
He would not violate the sanctities of
womanhood in hope of saving men
from the consequence of their sins.
Jesus, seeing his Father's image in
all men, would not despise
people because others derived from the color
of their skin.
He would not hinder a man having
a darker shade of skin from sitting in
a railway carriage by his side.
Jesus would not refrain from telling
those who do such things that they
are not yet Christians, and should
never so describe themselves.
Jesus would not despise a woman
because she earned her living by doing
those punishable duties that
others neglected.
Jesus would never "scorn" those
because the mistakes of the poor and ignorant; the
futile aspirations of the suppressed, or
the despair of the wronged.
Jesus would not rashly destroy any
thing which had come from the
hands of his Father.
Jesus would never do a real in itself
evil, on the plea that it might lead to
good.
Jesus would never sacrifice others to
himself on the grounds
of his own superiority.

TWO MEANINGS.
"What a bird-like appetite she has,"
remarked an admirer to the crusty old
bachelor who is helping the family
entertain her while she is visiting.
"Bird-like? I should say so. Any-
thing from turkey to reed bird."

FREE SILVER'S DEAD LEADER.

A harmful influence undoubtedly
was Richard P. Bland's, but never a
belittling one. The man's sincerity in
the holding of his self-assured concln-
sions was so patent that insincerity
of those who acted on his influence
was odious. Hence among those who
have been put to the most trouble in
controverting his peculiarly indigen-
ous heresies the news of his death will
revive sympathy for the sharpest dis-
appointment of a generally disappoint-
ed career.
If there had been an honest hair in
the heads of the men who managed
the democratic convention of three
years ago Bland would have been its
nominee. The platform was the tri-
umph in the party of the one idea for
which he had struggled for over twen-
ty years. All the harvest then
gathered by the long repressed forces
of the real democracy was from seed
sown by him. He was the author and
the representative of the wild, untu-
tored, untrained democratic free-silver
element which had nothing in common
with the European bi-metallism be-
hind which the "silver republicans"
sought to conceal their smelter stock.
Before all men he was the “logical
candidate.” The country so believed.
So he believed. The little knot of
intriguers who ran the convention
pretended so to believe, as the early
ballots showed. Their punishment
was when the delay in nominating
Bland, which they had thought to
utilize for the advantage of one of
their own little senate clique, was
seized by an aggressive thrust from
Nebraska whose commanding delega-
tion had barely got its feet on the floor,
and whose connection with the silver
movement was confined to one un-
heard and unread speech in congress.
“Silver Dick,” for the good of the
cause in which he was a sincere be-
liever, magnanimously concealed his
resentment against the old tricksters
and the young one. But that his heart
was broken the later records of con-
gress show. The voice which for
nearly a quarter of a century had
sounded from the skirmish line of
every financial debate was either si-
lent or feeble and perfunctory in the
party clashes on the Teller resolution
and the war revenue bill.
That in the hour of his nearest ap-
proach to triumph the free silver
party denied a decent filial regard to
the author of its being is, perhaps, the
grimmest irony to be found in
history. New York Press.

BIG MONEY TO SPEND.

Statement of the Resources of
the African Company.

In a recent letter to the British
colonial office in reference to the gov-
ernment’s refusal to guarantee inter-
est on bonds of his Cape-to-Cairo rail-
way, Mr. Cecil Rhodes discloses inci-
dentally the extent of the resources
with which he is now operating in
Rhodesia. His point is that the
government was not dealing with a
pauper, but with parties well able to
meet their engagements. The British
South Africa company, he says, has
now in hand, for administration and
other purposes, £10,000,000. In addition
it had raised in the past month
for railway development £15,000,000,
and besides that the money required
for the extension of the railway line
to Tanganyika had been secured. With
the government’s guarantee this
money would have been obtained at
2½ per cent and the effect of the re-
fusal of the guarantee was merely to
raise the rate of interest paid on the
loan to 5 per cent.
Over and above these resources of
the company for developing the coun-
try aggregating over $35,000,000,
large sums were being placed in Rho-
desia by independent companies.
Various mining companies, Mr. Rhodes
stated, have raised about £10,000,000 to
develop their properties. The gold
prospects of Rhodesia are no longer
he says, open to question. The mines
are now producing gold at a profit and
will produce better when the coal
mines and labor districts are tapped
by the northern railway which has
just been begun. The existing new
railway from the south to Bulawayo
pays handsomely. On the strength of
this showing the London government
acts stubbornly, Mr. Rhodes intimates,
not to give him the desired guarantee
on the railway extending northward
from Bulawayo. Baltimore Sun.

ROTHSCHILD'S STRAW PLUG HAT.

Last night the Hon. Walter Roths-
child made his appearance crowned
with a hat the like of which had never
been seen at Westminster. The shape
was that of the ordinary tall silk hat,
but the material was light-colored
plaited straw, and although his fellow
members looked a little surprised at
the innovation, envy of the coolness
of the headgear was quite as strong
as astonishment at the new member’s
courage. Westminster Gazette.
