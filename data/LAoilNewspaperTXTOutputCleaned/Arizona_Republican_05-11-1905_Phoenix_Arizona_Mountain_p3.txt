Manager Stechan announces the
last combination engagement of the
season to take place next Monday eve
ning May 15.
A wide awake, quick, merry comedy
production "Alphonse and Gaston" is
described to be. It will be seen here
for the first time at the Hardwick the
ater next Monday evening, May 15.
It was after long negotiation that
the H. E. Lester company under whose
direction the production is made, ob
tained, above all other competitors, the
exclusive privilege of dramatization
from artist F. Opper and William R.
Hearst, the owner of the copyright.
Two conditions of the agreement were
that only a first class company should
be employed in its interpretation and
that its theatrical embellishment should
be refined in every detail. The con
ditions were made necessary because
the comic pictures of Alphonse and
Gaston are still current in Mr. Hearst's
publications and should they be made
offensive in any way on the stage, they
would probably depreciate in value as
the leading comic feature of his news
papers. This promise made by the
management has been fulfilled in ev
ery sense and "Alphonse and Gaston"
will be found to be one of the most
enjoyable of all the plays based upon
humorous situations and comic char
acters that have been seen this season.
In order to live up to their agreement
a first class company of comedians,
singers and specialty artists are en
gaged in the interpretation of this
farce; the costumes are all very hand
some, the scenery is complete. Special
reduced summer prices. Reserved seats
75c 50c to be had at Goodman's Gallery.
Adults and children 25c.

I

The tone of the Steinway Piano is absolutely pure, exquisite in
quality, dominant in power. It is an ideal conception; once heard, it
lives in the memory, the substance of music. The Steinway Piano
tone is undiminished and beautiful after a lifetime's use of the in
strument. The touch is always delicate and responsive.
For distinctive and high class individuality, for sweetness and
richness of tone and superiority of construction, and for elegance of
exterior, the Steinway Piano is and always will be unexcelled.
The highest standard of piano value is embodied in the piano which
for four generations has captivated music loving people in the piano
that has won highest awards at all of the world's greatest expositions,
the peerless Steinway.

For people who appreciate bargains this sale is
a rare feast and you can bet they are taking ad
vantage of it. One woman in particular pur
chased exactly $45 worth of goods here yesterday

she paid the clerk $29.00 and took home $45.00
worth of new spring dry goods. Don't you think

it paid her to attend the sale? Of course every-

one doesn't need that amount of goods, but no
