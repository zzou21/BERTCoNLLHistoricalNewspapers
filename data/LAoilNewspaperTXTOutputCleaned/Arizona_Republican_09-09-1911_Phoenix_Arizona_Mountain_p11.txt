General Agent

He was a well-dressed, well-ap
pearing man of about 30 years of
age, and he went to Jack Sweeney
Thursday, and said he represented
a large roofing company on the
coast and wanted to rent a busi
ness office in the National Bank of
Arizona building. The transaction
looked like a straight out business
proposition and failed to excite the
slightest suspicion. He said his
name was C. E. Morton.

Having attended to this prelim
inary, Mr. Morton went to a printing
office and ordered some business
cards, also a lot of letterheads and
other stationery. All of these were
for the use of Mr. Morton as rep
resentative of the roofing company
aforesaid.

Finally, some time after dark
the preliminaries all having been
completed, Mr. Morton got down to
the real business of the day. He
went to the Huffin drug store and
presented a check for twenty dol
lars. It was stamped with the name
of the company by which Mr. Morton
was supposed to have been employed
and was signed by himself. He
wanted the money to pay his office
rent.

But yesterday when the check
was turned into the bank it was
discovered that Mr. Morton had for
gotten to deposit funds there suf
ficient to meet the check. In fact
he had no account at this bank at
all and is totally unknown to the
bank people.

Mr. Morton hasn't yet called
around to explain, nor have the of
ficers been able to locate him. In
fact there is not much hope of his
apprehension, as only the most gen
eral description of the man can be
furnished, and the chances are that
he has put a good many miles be
tween himself and Phoenix by this
time.

The commencement of the annual
crippling process of our children will
begin before many weeks have passed.
The schools will take from their beau
tiful out-of-door play the youngsters
whose vertebrae are made up to a
considerable degree of cartilage, and
are therefore soft and easily pushed
out of shape and put them in ill-arranged
seats, forcing them to keep
comparatively still, while the super
imposed weight of the upper parts of
the body, combined with the faulty po
sitions assumed, does its work of de
struction to an extent, as regards num
bers, not even guessed by the gener
al public. Statistics show that a very
large percentage of school children have
scoliosis. As Dr. Royal Whitman says
in his Orthopedic Surgery: "Lateral
curvature of the spine is one of the
most common of deformities," and it is
increasing in direct ratio as the school
curriculum is becoming more exacting.
A decided change for the better can
be made in our schools. The sessions
should be shorter, and the periods of
prolonged sitting should be broken up.
Deportment always bulks large in the
school report, and one of the main in
fractions against "good deportment" is
that of simple moving about in the
seat, especially when the pupil turns
and looks toward the back of the room.
thus healthfully twisting the spine.
This enforced quietude at just the
stage of life in which every animal, in
cluding the human, is meant by God to
be most active is horribly pernicious.

Legal Registration for
First State Election

ENABLING ACT AND STATUTE

Governing Provisions Are
Quoted by Attorney Gen
eral Wright in an Opin
ion Herewith Printed in
Full.

There can be no reregistration of
voters for the election to be held De
cember 12 for action on the constitu
tion and the election of state officers.
That at least is the opinion of Attor-
ney General John B. Wright on the
question, rendered in response to the
request of the district attorneys of
several counties. So many have writ
ten him regarding the matter that he
has decided to give publicity to his
findings in a search of the law, for
the benefit of all. While it will seem
a hardship to many good citizens who
have come here within the last two
years, to be deprived of their vote, J
within twenty-one days prior to the
election for constitutional delegates,
could vote for constitutional delegates.
There is no doubt that the names of
all such persons did constitute the
great register for the election for con
stitutional delegates. The fact that
said section 19 of the enabling Act.
thereafter provided that the provisions
of said section should apply to all
state elections, makes imperative the
conclusion that only such persons re
ferred to can vote at any of the elec
tions provided for in the Enabling
Act.
But even were there any doubt in
reference to the above conclusions such
doubt is eliminated by the provision
of "Election Ordinance Number
adopted by the constitutional conven
tion.

Section 3 of "Election Ordinance
Number 2" specifically defines the
qualifications for electors at the first
state election.

According to its terms any male cit
izen of the United States of the age
of twenty-one, who shall have resided
in the territory at least twelve months,
next preceding the date of the elec
tion heretofore held for the election
of delegates to the constitutional con
vention, who shall possess in other
respects the qualifications provided
for by Title 20 of the Revised Statutes
of Arizona, and whose name shall ap
pear upon the great register as con
stituted by section 19 of the Enabling
Act shall be qualified to vote.
The great register as constituted by
section 19 of the Enabling Act, is com
posed of the names appearing upon
the great register of 1908, plus the
names of all those who thereafter
registered up to and within twenty-one
days prior to the election of consti
tutional delegates.
Said "Election Ordinance Number
2" in no manner authorizes anyone
to vote at the state election, who has
registered subsequent to twenty-one
days prior to the election for consti
tutional delegates, but its specific
wording eliminates the possibility of
anyone voting at the first state elec
tion who registered subsequent to
twenty-one days prior to said election
for constitutional delegates.

that the president shall

TEMPE MAN TAKES
HAND IN OIL GAME

He is Associated With a Los Angeles
Man in a Deal in the Verde
Valley.

The first deal in Verde Valley oil
lands was consummated recently, when
J. H. Wingfield, John S. Marksberry,
James H. Wingfield, Jr., and Edward
Wingfield executed a lease to Dr.
Lewis F. Bleazby and Dr. W. G. De-
Vors on a section of land. Doctors
Bleazby and DeVors arrived yester
day en route to their homes, the for
mer to Los Angeles and the latter to
Tempe, says the Journal Miner. They
now go to the Verde a few days
ago, to make an examination of con
ditions. Dr. Bleazby is conversant
with the oil business and in a state
ment expressed himself in rather a
favorable manner over the indications
in that field for determining a supply
hence his connection with the deal.
The land taken over is patented and is,
situate below Camp Verde and close
to Clear Creek, where the oil excite
ment had its inception several weeks
ago.
Another transaction given publicity
yesterday in that section, was the sel
ling of the individual interests of J. W.
Hobbs, T. J. Arnold, H. D. Ross, Wil
liam Stephens, C. W. Stephens, C. C.
Callaway, E. H. Anthony, and W. T.
King to the Verde Valley Oil com
pany, in which the consideration was
$5000.
The rush to secure locations still
continuous, and yesterday notices were
filed covering forty-one twenty-acre
tracts, or an average of 820 acres. To
date the total acreage located is over
40,000.

Phoenix, Ariz., Sept. 5, 1911.

To the District Attorneys of Arizona:

Your telegram of September 6th re
ceived. You ask me to advise if per
sons registering subsequent to the
closing of the registration for the elec
tion of constitutional delegates, can
vote at the coming primaries to be
held October 24 and the state election
to be held December 12 next.

The question is of great importance
and has been bothering the district
attorneys throughout the territory, and
I have therefore given it close study.
and have requested and received the
advice of several of the leading at
torneys of the territory affiliated with
both the republican and democratic
parties. My opinion, and the reasons
therefor, will consequently be given
with some detail:

Section 19 of the Enabling Act pro-
vides that the qualified electors of
Arizona are authorized to vote for
delegates to a constitutional conven
tion; and that a qualified elector is
any male citizen of the United States
of the age of twenty-one years who
has resided in the territory at least
twelve months next preceding the date
fixed for the election for constitu
tional delegates, and who shall pos
sess in every respect the qualifications
of an elector as provided by Title 20
of the Revised Statutes of Arizona of
1901. Said section further provides
that the supervisors of each county
shall require a reregistration of the
qualified electors as above defined,
and a proviso is attached to the ef
fect that at a reregistration of the qual
ified electors whose names appear on
the great register for the year 1908 is
unnecessary but that such names to
gether with such as may register un
der the provisions of said section shall
constitute the great register of such
county and be used at each of the
elections provided for in the Enabling
Act.

Said section then provides further
that this provision shall apply to
voters at all elections for delegates to
the constitutional convention, for rat
ification of the constitution, for
state officers, members of the state
legislature, representatives in congress
and all other officers named in the
constitution or any others provided for
or mentioned in the Enabling Act.
From the provisions of said section
19, it would appear, therefore, that
qualified electors for all elections pro
vided for in the Enabling Act, would
be those registered under the re
registration aforesaid, that is to say,
those whose names appeared upon the
great register of each county for the
year 1908, and those additional per
sons who had registered thereafter
and up to twenty-one days prior to
the election of delegates to the con
stitutional convention.
It will be noted that the provision
of Chapter 3 of Title 20, Revised
Statutes of Arizona, is to govern in
the reregistration above referred to.
Paragraph 2303 of said chapter 3
title 20, provides that any one can
register twenty-one days before an
election and this explains my state
ment in the preceding paragraph that
only those registered in the great
register of 1908, and those registered
under the reregistration order of the
supervisors up to twenty-one days prior
to the holding of the election for del
egates to the constitutional convention.
would be entitled to vote.

Certainly it is clear from the pro
visions of section 19 of the Enabling
act, that only persons whose names
appear upon the great register of 1908
and those thereafter registering up to
twenty-one days prior to the election
for constitutional delegates, can vote
at any of the elections provided for in
the Enabling Act.

The congress of the United States
therefore, especially approved and rat
ified the provisions of "Election Ordi
nance Number 2" and its terms are
binding.
In reply to your telegram, therefore.
I have to state, that in my opinion, no
person registering since the closing of
the registration had prior to the elec
tion of constitutional delegates, can
vote at the coming primaries October
24th or at the coming election on De
cember 12th.
Respectfully submitted.
JOHN B. WRIGHT,
Attorney General of Arizona.

POTATO WAYS
Soak old potatoes in water.
Change the water while cooking if
strong.
Never allow potatoes to stand in
the sun.
Always pour off the water as soon
as done and remove the cover to
allow the steam to escape.
Potatoes cooked in the jackets
should be pierced to allow the steam
to escape.
Baked potatoes should be rolled in
a cloth till the skins burst. This
prevents the potatoes from cooking
too long, which makes them sticky
and soggy.
Potatoes should be simmered (not
boiled). It is a waste of fuel and
spoils the potatoes. Too rapid boil
ing makes them a solid paste which
is both unpalatable and indigestible.

Cook potatoes with the skins on as
often as possible. They are more
nourishing and palatable. Mashed
potatoes are delicious cooked in their
jackets peeled and mashed.
Potatoes may be kept warm a long
time without spoiling if the skins are
broken and the kettle well ventilated.
Potatoes well ventilated while
cooking are more wholesome and of
better flavor.
They may be baked, boiled, riced,
mashed, escalloped, potato balls,
potato salad, Saratoga
chips, shredded potatoes, creamed,
hashed brown, fried or sautéed, Lyon
naise potato and curried potatoes.
