ranch. where Evans once lived while
in the cattle business. It is almost on
the bank of the Hassayampa river, the
dry bed of which would be the logical
route for Wylie to have taken from
Wickenburg south.
Then the party turned north right up
the river bed as there was no road. The
last freshet in the river was a small
one and had smeared a few inches of
mud over the sandy bed of the river

so it made a passable sort of a road
and Hill turned the nose of the machine
up creek and "let her out," everybody
scanning the course on either side.
Norton cautioned him to go fast but
carefully, for an accident meant more
loss of time than slow speed, but Hill
went so fast and carefully. Arriving
at a point due west of Hot Springs
junction and encountering a road that
runs from the river to the junction,
they turned east on the road and
reached the junction about 10:15 A. M.
yesterday. Here they got something to

eat and learned by communication with
Wickenburg that Wylie apparently had
not gone south but west from Wicken
burg. Hurrying on to that point at
2:45 they learned that Haver and other
searchers had found Wylie's trail,
and his chaps and other things by
which they felt sure they were on the
right course and about eight miles
west of Wickenburg.

A second machine was secured there
and the party divided up and others
joined it and they rushed on to the place
indicated where they found several men
deployed among the hills and in the
gulches and desert brush beating

around on foot, and two or three on
horseback. A couple of hours more
was spent in this search, the men cov
ering as much country as they could.
They found where Wylie in his delirium
had busied himself staking out
claims and building monuments, and
where he had wandered around, but
they could get no line on where he
was then. They thought they had cov
ered every place he had been and did
not know which way to turn. Earlier
both Norton and Adams felt sure he
was still alive as they found no clothes
and one perishing under those condi
tions always discards his raiment be
fore the end. However, when they
could discover nothing further they
had about concluded he had died of
exhaustion or heart failure or some
sudden attack and there was no fur
ther chance of finding him alive. It
was then that Adams did his lucky
shooting. Mr. Norton was some dis
tance away and returned in the other
machine to Wickenburg so did not see
Wylie until they all arrived at the
railroad town. Wylie was in a very
fair condition when found, all things
considered, but the ride to Wickenburg
in his feeble condition nauseated him
and he was quite ill when they got
there. Mr. Norton then arranged to
come home on the train and offered to
bring the rest of the party down the
same way but Hill declared he was
going to drive the machine through last
night and Adams and Evans remained
with him. They left there about 7:30
last night and if they had no accident
probably got into Phoenix at an early
hour this morning having missed a
couple of nights' sleep and endured a
good hard day's work between the two
night stunts. Norton says he had a
bunch of picked men and feels proud
that he was so good a picker.

weaker, and more poorly equipped
members who otherwise are likely to
do duty as lawmakers. And, it was
figured further, that such lightweights
as did manage to be elected, would
be easily controlled, so that the real
highbrow statesmen, those of the
class who put through the Worsley
Roberts bill the other day, would
have everything their own way in
shaping legislation.
And that isn't quite all. It was
argued, with some acumen, too, that
this is the best possible time to get
the bill through. It was pointed out
that there is considerable feeling be
tween the upper and lower houses and
that the lower house would, in all
probability, swallow the bait and vote
to abolish the senate when, if the
plan did not miscarry, it would to all
intents and purposes, be abolishing it
self. Of course, that argument was never
used on the floor of the senate. On
the contrary, it was carefully sup
pressed. But that is the argument
that was used when the bill was con
sidered privately. The arguments
made for publication were to the ef
fect that the senate is a useless body
under the "Arizona plan" of govern
ment: that It has been superseded by
the direct legislative plan; and that
its abolition would mean an immense
saving to the taxpayers.

It is not quite certain that the
house members know the real purport
of the bill. But if they didn't know
it before, they have an excellent
chance of knowing it now. If they
have been observing the recent course
of events, they will recall that one
of the statements made when the bill
was under discussion was the state
ment that it did not matter which
house was abolished, so that it was
one of them. It will also be recalled
that the prime movers in the scheme
were careful to insert an amendment
providing that those now in office
would be taken care of in the event
the upper house should be chased off
the map. Under all these circum
stances, it will be more interesting
than ever to watch the course of
events in the house when the senate
bill comes up.

The senate yesterday afternoon took
a whirl at the canvassing board that
handled the returns of the late state
election. First, a memorial was intro
duced calling upon congress to pay
these men, and simultaneously there
was a motion to postpone indefinitely
the senate bill providing that they
should be paid from the state treas
ury. The motion to postpone indefi
nitely failed, and then there was noth
ing to do but amend it to pare down
the appropriation as much as possi
ble. There was a speech or two
about the awful work of these republicans
in holding star chamber ses
sions when the votes were counted,
and then it was decided that the
bills should be cut in halves. In that
form the measure was recommended

for passage.

Yesterday saw the finishing touches
put to the school land bill, by which
it was proposed to amend the consti
tution perpetually to forbid the sale of
these lands, but to permit leases up to
ninety-nine years. The bill had been
recommended for indefinite postpone
ment Saturday, but final action was
not taken until yesterday afternoon,
when the bill was killed.
There was a touch of the dramatic
in the senate proceedings yesterday
evening when Senators Hughes, Wood,
Davis and Pace, all democrats, sent
to the clerk's desk and caused to be
read a protest against the passage
of the senate suicide bill. They de
clared such action to be unseemly;
that they were entrusted with com
missions from the people and they did
not feel that they were called upon
to surrender them, that they believe

in the system of checks and balances
which two legislative bodies ensure;
and finally that the scheme is un-
American and undemocratic. The
protest went on the journal of the
senate.
It will thus be seen that the beau
tiful harmony which we have been
told actuates all the democrats in
Arizona, is honored in the breach
rather than in the observance.
After a few feeble gasps the pro
posed anti-lobbying bill gave up the
ghost yesterday afternoon. It was
killed both in the house and in the
senate, so that no one will make a
mistake by assuming that it is dead.
It would be easier to pass the crudest
kind of counterfeit money than to
pass an anti-lobbying bill through
these two houses of the legislature.
And this in the face of the fact
that both houses profess themselves
in favor of an anti-lobbying bill.
But the trouble is that the house
doesn't want the kind the senate
wants, and the senate would rather
do without an anti-lobbying bill for
ever than pass the sort advocated by
the house.

The anti-lobbying work in the two
houses this term has had a funny
history. The house passed a bill and
sent it to the senate. The senate had
a bill of its own. So, it tacked the
house number and title on its bill and
sent it back as the house measure "as
amended." The house promptly
turned down the proposition advocated
by the senate, and there was a con
ference or two.
The conference committee brought
in a bill which was much more like
the house than the senate measure.
The senate conferees said it was
positively the best that could be done
that those house fellows were the
most contrary lot of citizens they had
ever tried to do business with, or
words to that effect. But the senate
did vote to adopt the conference re
port. But yesterday Worsley and Cunniff
took another squint at the conference
bill. And no sooner had they had a
good look at it than they threw up
their hands in horror. "It's an out
rage!" said Cunniff. "It's a lobbying
bill and not an anti-lobbying bill,"
said Worsley. "Why, if we pass this
bill those awful lobbyists can actually
come here to the capitol and talk to
the committees and you can't stop
you. Horrors! Shall it be said of

this patriotic senate that it shall ex-
pose its members to such awful temp-
tation? It shall not. Away with such — some who said they didn't want to
spend the money, others who said the militia is not much good anyway.

and one Worsley who, true to his
creed, said he wanted to see the mili
tia reserve in all the states abolished.
Senator Breen was the most active
man in either house in working for
this bill. And, as stated above, it
seemed for a time that his work was
to bear fruit and that a decent ap-
propriation bill. Better no bill than the kind
the house would foist upon us."
And then they swatted it. They
swatted it good and hard, so hard

that after the performance was over

the legislative doctors pronounced the

measure dead beyond recall.
In the meantime, much the same
sort of scene was transpiring in the

caring so much about that bill any
way. The senate had been too uppish,
and if it couldn't accept a perfectly
good bill, such as was sent it by the
house, why, it could go without any.
And that is the way the anti-lobbying
bill died. It's awful, but it's true.

There is some more trouble for the
board of control measure. The house
has refused to concur in the senate
amendments and so there is more
work for today.
The following bills will be up for
final action today:
The bill providing that no fees
shall be collected from the state,
county, or from the corporation or
tax commissions in cases to which
they are parties.
The board of deposit bill.
The canvassing board bill.
The state auditor bill.
The bill providing an appropriation
for the land commission.
The bill authorizing cities to sell
real and personal property.
The highway franchise bill.
The eminent domain bill.
The bill providing for registration
certificates.
The bill regulating the practice of
medicine was killed yesterday. The
bill relating to gas, electric and water

SPEED TALK HERE

George Hageman Posts $500
Against Local Cars to
Beat His Record — Tremaine Will Cover Money
Conditionally.

The dust from the flying wheels of
George Hageman's Franklin car has
settled over the fields of blowing grain
by the roadside, but the excitement,
claims and counter boasts seem with
out end though it is not time yet to
say, "and void."
Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Hageman
placed in the hands of The Republican
a check for $500. This is a very lo
quacious check because it has a great
deal to say. In dollar talk which is good
old United States, it stoutly maintains
that no local driver in a local car can
go the route over the Tempo loop, fol
lowing precisely the road of the late
race in 29 minutes and 45 seconds, be
ing just three minutes faster than the
time made by the air cooler.
The stipulation of one trial for the
five contestants, makes the deciding fac
tor of the contest, the ability of the car

to ride as lightly on its rubbers as the
Franklin is claimed to do.

The drawing of the check is designed
to crystallize talk about town and turn
thoughts and words to acts. In this Mr.
Hageman was very successful. Five
minutes after the news arrived at The
Republican office of the advent of cash
W. D. Tremaine called up with the an
nouncement that he could see very
clearly any amount of coin of the
realm in Hageman's possession up to
half a thousand plunks, and was wil
ling to divide same with an equal amount
of his own lucre. He is quite handy at
thinking up conditions too; the sum of
his deliberations being the stipulation
that as valley roads have a peculiar
habit of becoming flooded with good
river water and in some unaccountable
way smeared with hardware of the
tack and nail variety, he would de
mand a second trial in the event of
flooded roads or punctured tires.

Unless Hageman is persuadable on
this point or Tremaine is willing to risk
a blowout for the chance to earn bank
directors' salary for 29 minutes or so
the bet will not be made. In case either
is agreeable to ceding a bit of their po
sition, the sporting life section of the
city will be enlivened with one of the
hottest fought road runs ever witnessed.
