PARRICIDES
CONFESSION

The Cause of Disaster On
the Lehigh Valley
LIST OF DEAD IS 26

Only Half of Them Have so
Far Been Identified. The
69 Wounded are Scattered
Along the Line in Half
Dozen Hospitals.
Manchester, N. Y., Aug. 26. Twenty-
six persons are dead, half a dozen
more lie at death's door and sixty
nine others crowd the hospitals from
Canandaigua to Rochester, according
to the latest figures, as a result of
the wreck of Lehigh Valley train No.
4 eastbound, behind two powerful lo-
comotives on a trestle spanning Can-
andaigua outlet, yesterday.
A ninety-pound rail on the 400-foot
bridge, shattered into seventeen
pieces, showing defects in manufac-
ture, marked the weak spot, investi-
gators say and explains the cause of
the disaster. So far but half - the
twenty-six men who met death among
the twisted, splintered mass of wreck-
age fifty feet below the trestle have
been identified. Four of these are
from Rochester. The other twenty
two lie in the Shortsville morgue in
rough pine boxes. The injured are
in the following hospitals: Rochester
Hanneman Hospital, 18; Homeo-
pathic, 7; total, 25.
Clifton Springs Sanitarium, 12;
Canandaigua Memorial Hospital, 11.
Shortsville reported as injured and
not found in the preceding hospitals,
15.
Steps looking to the usual rigid in-
vestigation already have been taken
by public service commission cor-
oners and other officials who have
workers on the scene. The following
is the revised list of identifications
as given out: Dead Henry Becker,
Waverly, N. Y., brakeman; D. M. Bell,
Los Angeles, G. A. R. Veteran, 70
years old, died in a Rochester hospi-
tal; Mrs. Headley of Philadelphia;
Joseph Hickey, Philadelphia; Charles
Hicks, Newark, N. J.; Mrs. C. F.
Hunsicker, Lakewood, a suburb of
Cleveland, O.; Dr. C. H. Johnson,
Philadelphia; L. C. Madden, Trenton,
N. J.; Edgar D. Pangborn, Brooklyn,
a G. A. R. veteran, employed at Ellis
Island, aged sixty-two; Helen E. Pow-
nall of Newton, Pa.; Mr. and Mrs. I.
S. Uncle of Smithville, N. J.; Mrs.
Rebecca Vanderlip, Niagara Falls;
Mrs. Freda Winkler of Philadelphia,
identification not positive; Mrs. A.
Zudeck, Buffalo; Willis P. Runkle,
freight clerk, Easton, Pa.
Eight bodies remain to be identi-
fied, one man, one six-year old boy
and six women. Most of these are
believed to have been residents of
Philadelphia.

LATER WILL MADE
BY J. W. GATES
Wherein it Differs From The Earlier
Instrument.
New York, Aug. 26. The announce-
ment that the will made by John W.
Gates in May 1910 which was made
public the day of his funeral on
Wednesday by Henry M. Glidersleeve,
had been revoked by a will in March,
1911, was made today by the attor-
neys who drew the latter instrument.
The 1910 document left all, but about
$1,000,000 in a trust fund for the
widow, to the son, forbidding the sale
of any securities for ten years. So
far as the attorneys' statement shows,
there is no provision of this sort in
the new will which gives the son a
million outright, with $2,000,000 in
trust, and the widow the remainder of
the estate with the exception of about
$700,000 which is divided among rela-
tives and friends. The statement adds
that Mrs. Gates, "in pursuance of the
wish of her husband has arranged to
turn over to the son a part of the
portion of the estate bequeathed her,
sufficiently large to make their shares
approximately equal."
The estate has been unofficially suit-
ed to be worth $30,000,000. Chas.
G. Gates declined to be interviewed
as to whether the new will permitted
or directed the immediate disposition
of his father's large holdings. Mrs.
Gates and her son are named as
executors of the will which will shortly
be presented for probate in Jefferson
county, Texas, where Gates resided.
A hundred thousand dollars to the Mary
Gates hospital at Port Arthur is one
of the charitable bequests.

Chicago, Aug. 26. Champ Clark,
speaker of the house, received an un-
official nomination for the presidency
by the republican party. Congressman
James Mann of Illinois, leader of the
republican minority in the house,
speaking at the Delta Tau Delta fra-
ternity convention, generously offered
Mr. Clark the democratic plum, act-
ing, he declared, for fear the demo-
crats might not select him.
"If the Lord chastens us" he said
"with a democratic administration and
president I would be pleased if the
party should select Clark. Lest they
might not do so, I hereby place Clark
in nomination.

MEXICAN POLITICS.

Progressives National Convention Will
Meet Today.
Mexico City, Aug. 26. Few believe
that Dr. Francisco Vasquez Gomez
will be nominated as vice president
on the Madero ticket by the pro-
gressives whose national convention
will open tomorrow. Madero's old
running mate will receive some sup-
port at the convention but opposition
will be given by the adherents of Al-
fredo Robles Dominguez and Jose
Pino Suarez.
Suarez is said to be Madero's
favorite. That Madero will be nominated
for president is undisputed. The only
work of the convention tomorrow will
be the examination of the credentials
of the organization. The naming of
candidates will come on Monday.

THREW HER OVERBOARD.
His Sweetheart Had Thrown Walter
Hopper Over.
Holland, Mich., Aug. 26. Angered,
he said, because Grace Lyons of Chi-
cago broke her promise of marriage,
Walter Hopper of that city attacked
her aboard the steamer Puritan in
mid-lake and tossed her overboard.
The body was not recovered. News
of the tragedy was flashed by wireless
and officers were waiting for
Hopper when the boat reached the
dock.

TWO WERE KILLED
IN ELGIN RACES
IT WAS A DAY OF ACCIDENTS
Many Injured in Collapse of Grand
Stand.
Elgin, Ill., Aug. 25. The 305-mile
automobile road race, won by Len
Zengel, in a National car, with Harry
Grant second, Hugh Hughes, third, was
not accomplished without a toll of
death and injuries. David Buck, vet-
eran automobile racer, was traveling
sixty-five miles an hour on
the back stretch when his right front
wheel threw a tire. The machine
turned somersault and Sam Jacobs, the
mechanician was instantly killed.
Buck's back was broken and he died
tonight. Every eye was on Mrs. Buck
when she left her chair in the grand
stand, and went in a machine to the
field hospital where her husband
received first aid. She became hysteri-
cal when she learned that his injur-
ies were fatal.
Several sections of the poorly built
stand gave way, but the thousands of
spectators were not dropped entirely
to the ground. Four suffered broken
legs, among them being a daughter
of Senator William Lorimer. Others,
suffered cuts and bruises.
Ten cars, which were on the course,
were stopped as soon as they reached
the repair pit, and a new start was
made fifty minutes later.
Ralph Mulford, whose car was the
last away, and who won last year's
race, set a terrific pace. For fifty
nine miles he drove at sixty-nine miles
an hour, leading the field by a good
six minutes. On the next lap he
went out of the race with a burned
connecting rod bearing. This placed
Zengel in first position, with Grant,
two minutes behind. They finished
this position, although Grant lost
twelve minutes from tire trouble.
Hughes, the third, was eleven seconds
behind Grant. Zengel's time average
for the race was four miles an hour
faster than that set by Mulford last
year.
Zengel's average was 66.55 miles an
hour. Grant drove an Alco car.
Hughes drove a Mercer.
The Elgin National trophy was for
cars under 600 inch displacement, the
prizes in cash valued at $6500 to win-
ner, the distance 305.5 miles; the lap
5 1/2 miles.

MISSING HUSBAND.
Bakersfield, Aug. 26. Leaving his
bride of a month to go to Seattle where
he expected a job with the Oregon
railway, A. A. McCord, locomotive en-
gineer of thirty, disappeared on May
5th. His wife today began a country
wide search. When he left he had
$900 and last heard of he was in Sacramento.

Those Who Heard Presi-
dent Taft at Hamilton, Mass.
THEY KEYNOTE SOUNDED

He Talked of the Late At-
tempts at Tariff Revision
as "Playing Politics" and
Addressed Himself Espec-
ially to LaFollette.
Hamilton, Mass., Aug. 26. President
Taft began the presidential campaign
of 1912 in a speech that breathed de-
fiance and condemned the efforts of
the "Insurgent" republicans, and dem-
ocrats combined to revise several
schedules of the present tariff at the
special session of congress just closed.
The president singled out Senator La-
Follette, of Wisconsin, Speaker Champ
Clark, and Chairman Underwood, of the
house ways and means committee, as
leaders in the movement, and charged
them with "playing politics."
Several times he referred by name
to Mr. LaFollette, but Mr. Taft indi-
cated that he regarded the proposed
revision as injurious, and dangerous to
business, but he made it plain that if
the tariff board report in December
was in favor of a downward revision
of the cotton and wool schedules he
would recommend a reduction.
Standing on a broad terrace of Con-
gressman A. P. Gardner's farm, with
Senator Lodge and other Massachus-
etts republican leaders, the president
seemed to scent the smoke of the com-
ing battle. Many of the 500 members
of the Essex county republican club,
who had gathered to listen, thought
they heard a "keynote speech of the
coming campaign, and their cheers
were loud and long.
Senator Lodge supplemented the
president's tariff remarks by a few
words, while two of the three candi-
dates for the republican nomination for
governor of Massachusetts, Lieutenant
Governor Frothingham and Speaker
Walker also spoke.
Mr. Taft said, "The extra session
of congress called for the purpose of
making a treaty. Our democratic
friends, however, were not content to
allow the session to pass with the ac-
complishment of the purpose for which
it was called. They assisted most of
them in the passage of the reciprocity
bill, because they believed in its use-
fulness, and did not play politics in
its passage."
"I am sorry to say, however, that
having pursued a purely statesman-
like course with reference to recipro-
city, they did 'play politics' with most
reprehensible character with respect to
the three tariff bills which, by unit-
ing with certain republicans in the sen-
ate, they were able to pass, and pre-
sent to the executive for signature.
The bills bear internal evidence that
they rested on a basis not of 'tariff
for revenue only but of 'tariff for 'pol-
itics only.' "

NEW MEXICAN GOVERNOR
OFFICIALLY INFORMED
The First State Election Will be
Held.
Santa Fe, Aug. 26. The receipt to-
night by Governor Mills, of the offi-
cial letter of President Taft directing
the governor to issue a proclamation
for an election of state officers, com-
pleted another chapter toward state-
hood.
The proclamation will be issued ear-
ly next week, calling the election for
November 7.

SUIT AGAINST S. P.
Attempt to Deprive Railroad of Cali-
fornia Oil Lands.
Los Angeles, Aug. 26. An action in
equity was filed in the United States
district court here with the object of
ousting the Southern Pacific railroad
company and subsidiary interests from
oil lands in Tulare county. The Peo-
ple's Development company is plaintiff
and the value of the land is estimated
at more than $1,000,000. The suit is
based on the ground that when the
United States government granted the
railroad every alternate section of land
along its right of way, mineral lands
were not included. The People's De-
velopment company lays claim to sev-
eral alternate sections in the San Joa-
quin oil field, which are being held by
the railroad. Several oil companies and
individuals who are operating on the oil
bearing lands under a lease or permit
from the railroad are named as co-defendants.

Paris, Aug. 26. Andre Jager
Schmidt, a Parisian journalist, drove
his automobile in front of the office
of the Daily Excelsior this morning,
shortly after nine o'clock, officially
completing a circuit of the world in
38 days 19 hours, 43 minutes, 37 4/5
seconds.
He left Paris July 17 in an attempt
to beat the record of M. Stiegler, of
the Paris Matin, who made the jour-
ney around the world in 63 days. Ja-ger-Schmidt
could have reached his
goal two hours earlier if he had not
stayed at Cherbourg after midnight
for a supper given in his honor by
journalists.

CALIFORNIA ROADS.

State Highway Commission Enters
Upon its Work.
Sacramento, Aug. 26. The first step
taken by the state highway com-
mission which was appointed a short
time ago by Governor Johnson, in the
matter of getting into action upon
the selection of highway routes under
the $18,000,000 highway bond issue
has been taken.
The action is in the form of a com-
munication to the board of supervis-
ors, chambers of commerce, civic
bodies and auto clubs. The com-
mission desires to obtain from those
bodies suggestions as to the proposed
routes for state highways. Upon these
suggestions the commission expects
to base final decision.

WILL NOT JOIN STRIKE
Statement of Counsel for Enginemen
and Firemen.
San Bernardino, Aug. 26. Four or-
ganizations which embrace men em-
ployed in the train service of the
United States will not join the strike of
the shop workers if the troubles of the
latter should result in a walk out. This
statement was made by Hugh L. Dick-
son of Peoria, Ill., general counsel of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen
and Enginemen, who arrived here to-
day.
Dickson, who was formerly district
attorney of San Bernardino county,
said he thought the reduction of the
forces in the shops put into effect to-
day by the Southern Pacific was not
a war measure, designed to forestall
the strike, but was due to a falling off
of business.
"Although I have no official knowl-
edge about the threatened strike of
the shopmen of the Harriman system."
Dickson continued, "I knew of the
men's demands and am afraid a
strike may come out of it. But our
organization and the other brother-
hoods of trainmen are not concerned
as they have satisfactory contracts
and will observe them."
Dickson said that in the event of a
strike the railroads would have a
hard time as the shopmen of the
Harriman lines have an organization
which embraces all brands of shop
work, with all the resources of the
American Federation of Labor behind
it.

APACHE KILLED BY LIGHTNING.
Globe, Aug. 26. Chuna Els, Apache
living six miles from here was killed
by lightning striking him on the
head. The bolt knocked three white
men from a wagon, and glanced and
killed the team.

A RUNNING MATE.
Providence, R. I., Aug. 26. Governor
Foss of Massachusetts, for vice presi-
dent of the United States in 1912, was
the slogan at a Rhode Island demo-
cratic love feast at Rocky Point to
night. Former Congressman John
Thayer of Worcester, Mass., launched
the Foss boom.

This Time Lee Tells a
True Story

HE BROODED UNTIL
His Family Stood in Way of
His Intended Marriage
And He Undertook to Re-
move Obstruction With
An Axe.
Evansville, Ind., Aug. 26. William
Lee, aged 22, has confessed that he
murdered his father, Richard Lee,
his mother, and younger brother, Clar-
ence, and then set fire to the family
home at Booneville, early on Thurs-
day in the hope of concealing the
crime.
In a verbal and written statement
to Sheriff Davis, Lee said his motive
was anger because his parents would
not consent to his marriage with Mina
Taylor which he said he had planned
for Thursday night, and would not
give him money with which to begin
housekeeping.
When the confession was made pub-
lic the officers started with him in
an automobile for the state reforma-
tory at Jeffersonville to prevent pos-
sible mob violence. Lee and previously
made a statement that he killed
his father in self defense after his
father murdered his wife and younger
son.
Lee said he went on Wednesday
night to Newburg and called upon his
fiancee. They talked over the arrange-
ments for their wedding. He had had
$100 in a bank but he had spent it.
He knew his parents had $50 in the
house. He returned home late and
his mother reprimanded him. He told
her that he was determined to marry
the following day. She answered that
he must stay at home. Going to his
own room, Lee said he brooded until
he was out of his mind.
Suddenly he rushed to the room
where his father, mother, and brother
slept. "I grabbed an ax by the door"
he said, "and struck for father, but
hit mother. My brother rose up and
I struck him. Then father, who had
been outside ran in and started to
grab me by the throat. I hit him and
he fell. I was scared so badly I did
not know what I was doing."
He said he lit a match to see what
he had done and then dropped the
flaming match on the bed where his
mother's body lay. "The flames
flashed up and blinded me," he said,
"I jumped to my room, put on my
trousers and ran to alarm the neigh-
bors." The fire in the Lee home was put
out before the bodies were more than
scorched. The parricide stolidly helped
to carry them out on the lawn, in-
sisting that he did not know how they
came to their death.
Already suffering from hysteria
Mina Taylor, Lee's fiancee, was pros-
trated when she heard that Lee had
confessed to the murders.

PEOPLE SHOUTED FIRE
TWENTY-FIVE DEAD
A Panic Caused by Explosion of Mov-
ing Picture Film.
Pittsburg, Aug. 26. Twenty-five are
known to be dead and a large number
injured following an explosion of a
moving picture film in the Morgan and
Grant opera house in Cannonsburg, Pa.,
twenty miles from here tonight. As
the film exploded some persons shout-
ed, "Fire." The house was crowded
with women and children. All rushed to
a hall leading to the stairway where
they were jammed on the stairs. A
few thought to use the fire escape.
Many were knocked down and trampled
upon. Most of the dead smothered in
the crush of persons who fought to
gain the street.

CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR.
Sacramento, Aug. 26. The fifty-
eighth annual California state fair
opened with large attendance. Program
consists of harness and racing races
and feats of horsemanship by cowboys
and cowgirls. There are a wealth of
displays in the exhibition buildings.
Governor and Mrs. Johnson and their
two sons were interested spectators.

HE WILL GIVE HALF
Bakersfield, Aug. 26. R. B. Scott, a
mining man of Randsburg, offered a
reward of $4350 for the return of a
wallet he lost several days ago in
Fresno. The wallet contained eight
$1000 bills and $700 in greenbacks of
smaller denominations.

Los Angeles, Aug. 26. Charles V.
Brennan, fifteen years old was stricken
with hydrophobia and brought to the
point of death tonight, after caring
for a sick dog which he thought had
suffered from poison.
Physicians say there is no hope for
the lad. Brennan was not bitten by
the animal, but doctors believe its
saliva infected a wound on the boy's
hand, and inoculated him with the
dreaded disease. Another lad, Bren-
nan's friend, who also fondled the
stricken dog was placed under the
Pasteur treatment.

KLINE KNOCKED OUT.

Gave Way Under Steady Beating by
Conley.
Los Angeles, Aug. 26. Frankie Con-
ley, of Kenosha, knocked out Patsy
Kline of Newark, in the fourteenth
of a twenty round fight at Vernon.
Kline received a severe beating and
went out more from accumulated
punishment than from any one blow.
He was perfectly conscious but too
weak to rise before the count. Con-
ley will fight the winner of the Rivers
Kilbane match scheduled for Labor
Day.

LONGEST FLIGHT.
Young Frenchman Won the Michelin
Cup.
Mourmelon, France, Aug. 26. H.
Helles, a young French aviator, broke
the record for a single continuous long
distance flight, in competition for the
Michelin cup. He covered 1300 kilo-
meters, 746 miles, in fifteen hours.
Previous record for the Michelin cup
was made by Jules Vedrines last year,
when he covered 500 kilometers in
seven hours, 56 minutes, 36 seconds.
Helles flew over a measured course,
and landed at Chalons Sur-Marne.

SEATTLE MOB MEMBERS
PUT UNDER ARREST
THEY FOOLED WITH UNITED
STATES COURT.
Warrants Issued Against Half Dozen
Prominent Citizens.
Seattle, Aug. 26. Charged with
conspiracy to obstruct the adminis-
tration of justice in the United States
court, Oliver T. Erickson, member of
the Seattle city council, Leroy San-
ders, editor of the Seattle Star, B. H.
Canfield, publisher of the Star and
manager of a string of Pacific news-
papers; John H. Perry, attorney for
Canfield and Saunders, Deputy Sher-
iff Hugo Kelly, Paul K. Mohr, a
labor leader; Thomas Horner, an at-
torney and Will Atkinson, a real es-
tate dealer, were arrested on war-
rants sworn to by United States Dis-
trict Attorney Elmer E. Todd. A
warrant for the arrest of A. V. Faw-
cett, who was ousted from office as
mayor of Tacoma in a recall election
was issued.
The Fawcett warrant was sent to
Tacoma for service. Erickson, Mohr
and Kelly were refused bail and were
sent to the county jail. Atkinson was
released on $1000 bail and the others
on $5000. The preliminary hearings
are set for next Wednesday.
The warrants for the alleged con-
spirators were issued as a result of
the hanging in effigy of United States
District Judge Cornelius N. Hanford
and for the utterance at a mass
meeting last night of inflammatory
speeches denouncing the court for is-
suing an injunction restraining the
people of Rainier valley from inter-
fering with the Seattle, Renton and
Southern railway which is involved
in a dispute with its patrons.
The information charges all leaders
of the mass meeting with conspiracy
to obstruct justice by arousing the
people to disobedience of the injunc-
tion. It also charges Canfield, Saun-
ders and Perry with responsibility for
hanging the judge in effigy.

JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE.
Tacoma, Aug. 26. Fawcett when ar-
rested gave bond in $500 to appear on
Monday. He explained his connection
with the meeting by saying that he was
induced by the editor of a local paper,
owned by same interests as the Seattle
Star to attend.

Prosecution's Testimony Dis-
sipating Beadie's Defense
WHAT SIX BOYS SAW

They Passed Defendant's
Automobile About Time
of His Wife's Murder
That Pool of Blood in
the Road.
Chesterfield Courthouse, Va., Aug.
26. Considerable progress was made
by the prosecution in the case of
Henry Clay Beattie Jr., on trial for
the murder of his young wife who
was slain with a shotgun while mo-
toring with her husband on Mid-
lothian Turnpike last month. Just
before adjournment of the court an
application by Seattle's counsel was
granted that the accused man be per-
mitted to go to Richmond so that the
defense might have a conference over
Sunday. The prisoner was whisked
back to Richmond, cheerfully waving
his hand from the automobile to those
he recognized.
There were many tense moments
for the prisoner as the prosecution
uncovered fragments of a conversa-
tion which he is alleged to have had
concerning Beulah Binford, the girl
in the case.
It was plainly evident that it was
the prosecution's endeavor to show
that the underlying motive for the
crime was the fear of Beattie that
his father would learn of his resump-
tion of his relations with Miss
Binford and a physical ailment he is
alleged to have had at the time of
the murder.
Half a dozen youths were placed
on the stand who were returning from
a dinner, on the night of the murder
and who had seen an automobile
standing in the road with a man
working on the hood and a woman
on the running board. One boy, W.
B. Snyder, identified Beattie's car as
the one he and his companions had
seen.
All six of the boys told the same
story of the woman on the running
board and fixed the hour of their
passage as almost coincident with
the hour of the murder. The prose-
cution, through Detective Schorer's
testimony later added to this trend
of proof that Seattle's wife was not
shot while seated beside him, as the
prisoner avers but while standing in
the road.
Schorer said Beattie had inconsistent,
varying conversations with him
in endeavoring to explain the pres-
ence of a pool of blood in the road.
Schorer monopolized the afternoon
session. His testimony frequently in-
troduced the name of Miss Binford
which excited the interest of the pris-
oner. His usual nonchalance gave
way and he strained forward over the
bench before him. Occasionally Beattie
put his arm around the neck of At-
torney Smith and whispered earnest-
ly. The court adjourned until Mon-
day.

TO TAKEN IN CUSTODY
Six Chicago Prisoners One of Whom
Has Confessed.
Chicago, Aug. 26. Six men are in
custody, and the arrest of another has
been ordered by the police in connec-
tion with the operation of the al-
leged arson ring which is said to be
responsible for fifty incendiary fires
which caused a property loss of $1,
000,000 in the last year here. Three
other men, including a former police
man, are being sought by the police
in connection with the alleged conspi-
racy. The men under arrest are: David
Korsliak, a former saloon keeper, al-
leged leader of the allied ring; con-
fessed; Charles Bloom, a merchant;
Max Feilschmidt, a fire insurance ad-
juster; Isaac Schaeffner, a real es-
tate dealer; Ellis Dubeistein, a shirt
waist manufacturer; Lazard Drey-
fuss, a wholesale clothing manufacturer.
