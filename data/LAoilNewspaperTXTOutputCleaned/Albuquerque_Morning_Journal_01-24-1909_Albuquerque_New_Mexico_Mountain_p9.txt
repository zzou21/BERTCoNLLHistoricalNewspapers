FINANCE AND

HIKE

Wall Street.
New York, Jan. 23. The profiteers who started an upward movement of prices oil Thursday which reached its extreme Friday morning continued today. The movement was not accompanied by any striking development in the news and must largely to the demonstration of the futility of the effort to attract a following on the buying side of the device of marking up prices.
The most interesting happenings of the day were found in the money and stock exchange markets. Decisive notice came from Paris in the movement of the discount and sterling exchange rates there that Paris' demands on London for gold will be pushed no further for the present. The private discount rate fell half per cent and sterling exchange rate rose 2 full centimes to 25.1 francs, 1.1 centimes. These are unusually violent movements and they represent the passing of the strain on the Paris money market incident to the subscription to the Russian loan. They also supply a definite answer to the problem which has troubled the financial world for months as to whether the Bank of France would cease to accumulate gold with the flotation of the Russian loan. A persistence in this policy would have been heralded as notice of fears of international complications to come. That the Bank of England will be allowed now to require the incoming shipments of South Africa gold which the Bank of France has taken regularly throughout the summer and autumn seems a foregone conclusion. The policy of the Bank of England in accumulating gold is prompted by the fact that its present gold holdings are some $20,000,000 less than a year ago in contrast with heavy increase in gold holdings of all other important banks, the increase in the case of the Bank of France reaching $17,000,000.

Fierce Badger Makes Attack on
Chief Spectator at Lively
Fight on North Fifth Street.
Notwithstanding the fact that the lid is on, a wildly exciting badger fight was pulled off yesterday in a secluded corral on North Fifth street. Only a few of the devotees of the strenuous sport were present, but they report a most exciting time.
The dog end of the game was upheld by a fierce brindle bull pup, the victor of a number of strenuous badger battles. The badger, a short, stocky specimen of the ring-necked, nocturnal variety, was captured by Messrs. Taylor and Head in the wilds of Central avenue. The betting before the fight was lively, with the odds a little on the dog, although those familiar with the qualities of the badger potted all wagers in sight.
Mr. Jamison of this city, recently of New York, was given the place of honor and amid the admiring cheers of the frenzied fans drew the ferocious badger from its box. Only by the exercise of the greatest ability did he escape the first terrific plunge of the open-mouthed beast.
The fight did not last long, owing to the overfed condition of the badger, and Mr. Krecknagel, the referee, decided in favor of the dog. The badger, however, was not materially injured, and its owners intend to put it in training to reduce its weight. When in fighting trim the badger will be ready for all comers.
