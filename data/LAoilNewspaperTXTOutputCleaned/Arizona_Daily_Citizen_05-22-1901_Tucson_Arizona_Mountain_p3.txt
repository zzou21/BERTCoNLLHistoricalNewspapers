Contagious
Blood Poison
There is no poison so highly contagious, so deceptive and so destructive. Don’t be too sure you are cured because all external signs of the disease have disappeared, and the doctor says you are well. Many persons have been dosed with Mercury and Potash for months or years, and pronounced cured—to realize when too late that the disease was only covered up—like a bad case of rheumatism, catarrh, scrofula or severe skin disease, an old sore or ulcer developing in middle life, can be traced to blood poison contracted in early life, for it remains smoldering in the system forever, unless properly treated and driven out in the beginning. S. S. S. is the only antidote for this peculiar virtue, the only remedy known that can overcome it and drive it out of the blood, and it does this so thoroughly and effectually that there is never a return of the disease to embarrass or humiliate you afterwards.
S. S. S. cures Contagious Blood Poison in any and all stages; contains no mineral to break down your constitution; it is purely vegetable and the only blood purifier known that cleanses the blood and at the same time builds up the general health.
Our little book on contagious blood poison is the most complete and instructive ever issued; it not only tells all about this disease, but also how to cure yourself at home. It is free and should be in the hands of everyone seeking a cure. Send for it.

A Good Thing.
German Syrup is the special preparation of Dr. A. Boschee, a celebrated German physician, and is acknowledged to be one of the most fortunate remedies in medicine. It quickly cures ordinary coughs and all lung troubles of the worst nature, removing, as it does, the cause of the affection and leaving the patient in a strong and healthy condition. It is not an ordinary medicine, but has stood the test of years, giving satisfaction in every case, which its rapidly increasing sale will testify. Two million bottles annually.
Boschee’s German Syrup was introduced in the United States in 1868, and is now sold in every town and village in the civilized world. Three doses will relieve any ordinary cough. Price 25c.
