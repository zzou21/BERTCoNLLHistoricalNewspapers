(SULPHUR SMOKE BEING
UTILIZED AT DOUGLAS
DOUGLAS—Some of the smelter
smoke that used to pour out of the
stacks at the C. & A. smelter is being
used in the production of sulphuric
acid and eventually will be used in
making dynamite by the Apache
Powder company at Benson. S. Nelson
and five men, all lead burners,
sent out by their company in San
Francisco, have arrived in Douglas
and have installed their plant at the
C. & A. smelter.
Mr. Nelson’s force is comprised of
Kenneth Kirkwood, J. A. Lundburg,
Jacob, Edgar, “Billy” Milan and
Harry Babby. They men received
lead sheets and lead rolls here,
which they have had fashioned into
converting machinery, the main tank
of which, with its many pipes, somewhat
resembles a big pipe organ.
Knowing how to set up these plants
or forms, and to operate them, is said
to be the professional knowledge of
only 117 men in the United States;
therefore, to explain the process is
almost impossible.
The gas from the smoke is used,
first being conducted through dust
chambers, then into cooler, into the
scrubber, and finally is converted into
sulphuric acid. A process of filtration
and what is known as “contact” takes
place. There likewise is a treatment
with acid to be used in the powder
manufacture—is placed in tanks and
is ready for shipment to the powder
company. It resembles water, but is
slightly thicker and will burn the hand,
it is so strong. Nitric acid is a by-product
of the lead and forms under a different
process.

Secretary of Labor Wilson reports
that his department has taken part
in the settling of 4,100 labor disputes
in the past year. In the past year 633,371
aliens entered the United States as compared
with 237,021 the year before.

The Western Union Telegraph company
has refused cablegrams sent by
the French government, as that government
refused to pay with gold and the
company lost much money through
the low rate of exchange.
