THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN WEDNESDAY MORNING. JUNE 20, 1917:

CRUCIAL
DELEGATION IS

SPLIT ON CAMP

A division of effort in Arizona's
congressional delegation is imperiling
Arizona's chances of securing a can
tonment camp. That information
came from Washington in a semi-official
telegram yesterday. It is under
stood that while Representative Hay
den is for Phoenix, Senator Smith is
working for Tucson and Senator Ash
urst for Prescott.
The telegram to Governor Campbell
states that the only cantonment site so
far selected in the southwest is to be
on the government reservation at Fort
Sam Houston, Texas, and contracts for
work on it will be let at the end of the
week. The telegram says:
"If you could have your people decide
upon some one point your delegation
here might succeed in getting a can
tonment camp, and failing that they
might land a national guard mobiliza
tion camp."
Six sites for the latter have been ac
cepted, at Fort Worth, Houston, Fort
Sill, Waco, Deming and Linda Vista,
the latter near San Diego. It was
stated in the dispatch that the prox
imity of Arizona to the border might
aid in securing either a cantonment
camp or a mobilization camp. An
other inducement would be the climate,
which would permit work at all sea
sons of the year.
Governor Campbell at once took the
matter up, not in behalf of any point
in Arizona, but in favor of some one
point on which the members of the
delegation might agree and forwarded
the following telegram to each of the
senators and representatives:
"Arizona will be much disappointed
if no cantonment selection is made in
the state. We have unequalled climatic
and strategic surroundings in connec
tion with the several sites offered the
site board. Unexampled forage and
foodstuff crops will tend to make
prices reasonable. I believe Arizona
cantonment could be managed as eco
nomically as elsewhere and the effi
ciency derived from the better condi
tion of the men is not to be disregarded.
Please use your most diligent efforts in behalf
of selection for Arizona. Please wire how we can serve
further to bring this about."

DEFINITE PROPOSITION IS MADE .
FOR REMOVAL OF OLDTOWN DITCH
: ' 1

I

Commission Plans Bond Issue Which Would Forever Take
From City Unsightly and Dangerous Canal Which Now Bisects City Cost to Municipality Would Not
Be In Excess of $80,000 and Might be Only $70,000

The town ditch is to be removed from
the city limits. Valuable land through
which the unsightly water course wends
its way is to be reclaimed and the men
ace to the lives of children and to the
health of every one is to be a thing of
the past. That is if the citizens of
Phoenix really want all this.
The city commission in considering
the budget for the ensuing fiscal year
will include provision for meeting the
expense of an election to determine
whether the city shall issue bonds for
between $70,000 and $80,000 to meet a
portion of the expense of the removal
of the ditch. The election is likely to
be called at an early date following the
adoption of the budget.
Following the efforts of City Com
missioner George X. McBean, a definite
proposition has been received from the
reclamation service looking to the re
moval of the ditch. The reclamation
service officials have announced in a
communication to the city commission
that it will remove the ditch, and divert
the waters from a point east of the
city limits, north to the Grand canal
and back to the lands west of the city
by means of the Nineteenth avenue
lateral, for the sum of $120,000. It is
estimated that this is the amount the
improvement will cost.
Figures of the city engineer and of
other engineers indicate that there will
be reclaimed to property owners, lands
valued at not less than $40,000 and pos
sibly as much as $50,000. Should the
amount recovered reach $50,000, it will

mean that the citizens will be called
upon to meet an additional expense of
$70,000, this sum to be raised by the sale
of the proposed bonds. Should but $40,
000 be recovered, it will mean that
bonds must be issued amounting to

$80,000.
Commissioner McBean is confident
that once the proposition is placed
squarely before the citizen taxpayers,
there is little doubt but that the pro
posed bonds will be voted practically
unanimously. The citizens generally
have been frequently before the city
commission almost demanding that by
one means or another, the town ditch
be removed. It has been shown that
the city should construct a conduit
that would take care of the waters of
the ditch, but the expense of such work
would almost prohibit. It would cost,
so the engineers say, about $200,000 to
place the ditch in a conduit from Ninth
street to Seventh avenue. This would
mean not only that the ditch would
still be open through a large area in
the city limits, but that there would
be a conduit requiring attention and
repair expense at some time in the fu
ture.
The exact date of the proposed bond
election has not been definitely deter
mined upon, but it is likely that it will
be not later than in September. In the
mean time, an aggressive campaign of
education will probably be inaugurated
to the end that when the election is
finally held, the sentiment for the re
moval of the ditch completely from the
city limits will be overwhelming.

EXTRA COPIES FOR STATEWIDE EDITION

With the thousands of extra copies of the Statewide Edition of The
Arizona Republican printed on Sunday, the demand has been so great
that but a few hundred now remain and from present indications it will
be but a short time until all will be in circulation, doing the maximum
of good for Arizona. This 100-page edition will be mailed by The Re
publican to any address at 15 cents the copy. Single copies will be sold
over the counter for 5 cents. One can merely make out a list of names
to which it is desired to send the edition, bring the list to the office
and pay the cost and The Republican will do the rest.
The Phoenix Chamber of Com
merce plans to make extensive use
of the edition to promote the inter
ests of the state. It is generally re
garded as the most complete paper
of its kind ever issued in the south
west. Every industry and every
part of the baby state is covered
with excellent write-ups which were
secured only through considerable
effort and no person can get a copy
of the Statewide Edition of The Re
publican and fail to be impressed
by the resources of the great state
of Arizona.

CHECK ARTISTS
IN LAW TOILS

to have forged a number of checks in
the name of his grandfather, C. E.
Tucker.
Richard H. Fulton was released on
his own recognizance by Justice De
Souza after being arraigned on a
charge of doing business as an agent
for an investment company without a
license. His trial was set for Friday
at 2 o'clock.
William Rosser charged with stealing a
motorcycle from Albert Suncelia,
waived preliminary examination and
was held to answer to the superior
court in the sum of $100 bail.

Charged with issuing a bogus check,
Ralph L. Colby was taken into custody
yesterday. The $25 check made in the
Valley bank and passed at the Owl
Drug Store is said to be but one of
many put in circulation by Colby who
was arraigned before Justice De Souza.
His preliminary hearing was set for
3 o'clock Saturday morning.
Harvey Ward, another alleged check
artist, who is charged with obtaining
money by a bogus check announced his
guilt when brought before Justice De
Souza for arraignment yesterday. He
waived examination and was bound
over to the superior court in the sum
of $1,000 bond. Ward is the young man
who is charged with working with
Ashley Ptelzride the boy who is alleged

Asking a continuance on the ground
that a handwriting expert should be
required to compare the recognized
signature of Charles Korrick with the
names that appear on the referendum
petitioners on the minimum wage law
which Mr. Korrick is alleged to have
signed more than once, Leon S. Jacobs

requested the court to continue the
case until Friday morning when Pres
ton T. Slayback, auditor of the Arizona
Hercules Copper company, could ap
pear as a witness. The continuance was
granted by Justice Wheeler.
The expert witness who was to ap
pear yesterday could not be located by
the county attorney who did not resist
the motion for a continuance made by
the defendant's counsel. When this tes
timony was not offered when the case
came up for hearing County Attorney
Laney presented as his first witness
Thomas A. French, secretary of the
State Federation of Labor, who swore
to the complaint. It developed that Mr.
French had sworn to the complaint
without making any investigation. He
based his charge entirely on the fact
that the petition bore Mr. Korrick's
name more than once. He did not take
any steps to locate D. O'Conner who
made an affidavit that he had positive
knowledge that Mr. Korrick signed the
petition twice, according to French's
own testimony. No search was made
for O'Conner.
"Did you sign Mr. Korrick's name to
the petition," French was asked under
cross examination.
"I did not," replied the federation
secretary.
"Do you believe Mr. Korrick wilfully,
knowingly and unlawfully signed the
petition twice?"
"I do," said the complaining witness.
Hugh Callahan was the state's next
witness. He also testified he had made
no attempt to find O'Conner.
The state then rested. Counsel for
the defendant asked for a dismissal on
the ground that there was no proof of
corpus delicti, that the chief witness
had never been interrogated and that
no effort had been made to locate him.
Primary evidence had not been in
troduced, contended counsel. The court
ruled with the state.

Do not wait 'till tomorrow; phone
that WANT AD to The Republican
office now, and get your wish fulfilled.

Los Angeles Trailer Company,
Los Angeles, California.
Gentlemen:
Trailers are considered by most people to be a mere frame with
springs mounted on a couple of axles on two or four wheels. Many
people have spent considerable money to learn that this is not
the case.
While we have always considered it economy to have nothing
but first-class constructed trailers to operate with Jeffery Quad
trucks, which is usually under conditions that a two-wheel drive
truck cannot operate, we wish to tell you frankly that the trailer
built by yourselves is one of the very few trailers that we would
wish to call successful in the way of keeping in the tracks of the
truck, and not wobbling all over the road.
After having tried out several makes of trailers, and also having
purchased several from you, we wish to advise that we are getting
better results with your trailers than with any others we have used
or experimented with.
Yours very truly,
HARTWELL MOTOR COMPANY,

Gentlemen:
Replying to your favor of Dec. 18th, would
state that we have had very satisfactory results
from the trailers which we have purchased
from you.
We find these trailers a very valuable asset
to us in our delivery business, as they come in
very handy, particularly in country districts.
By using them in conjunction with our Ford
cars, we are enabled to take care of our emer
gency deliveries. We have now over thirty in
operation and are very pleased with the results.
Yours truly,
C. W. RALPH
E.P.T. Manager of Stations.

Gentlemen:
We are mailing you under separate cover a
photograph of your trailers used by Banks
Bros. for the hauling of the Cardiff ore. We
wish to state that Banks Bros. are entirely sat
isfied with these trailers and would have no
other trailer.
In this picture Banks Bros. are shown, one
standing at the front of the truck and the other
one leaning against the rear end of the trailer.
Believing that this photograph shows your
trailers up to a good advantage and saying our
customers and ourselves are satisfied in every
way with your trailers, you may use us as
references.

Mr. W. F. Payne,
City.
Dear Sir:
We understand that you are interested in in
formation regarding trailers for use with motor
trucks.
We have been using a two-wheel trailer,
which we secured from the Los Angeles Trailer
Company some eight or nine months ago.
We use this both with our two-ton truck and
with our Ford truck and get excellent satisfac
tion from either.
We find that the use of this trailer gives us
almost as much delivery capacity as an addi
tional truck.
Our trailer has been in use continuously
since we have had it, and apparently is in as
good condition as when we first got it.
We believe that the trailer idea with motor
trucks represents about the most economical
delivery system yet tried.
Yours truly,
(Signed) EL PASO SASH & DOOR CO.,

Gentlemen:
Replying to yours of the 18th inst.
We have been using one of your trailers be
hind a Ford roadster for eighteen months at our
retail yard in Los Angeles, and we would not
know how to get along without it.
We are also using several of them in our
country retail connections, and they are giving
excellent satisfaction.
Yours very truly,

Gentlemen:
A year ago we ordered from you our first
two-wheel trailer for use behind a Ford. Since
then we have received three other two-wheel
models and are now beginning to operate the
four-wheel model recently shipped us, behind a
two-ton truck.
For your information, the two-wheel models
have given us excellent service with light cars,
and we anticipate equally good results with
the heavier model.
Very truly yours,
O. T. BASSETT & CO.

Gentlemen:
We are pleased to say that we have been
using two of your one-ton, two-wheeled trailers
for over a year, to supplement our auto equip
ment and know of nothing that is more con
venient to have around than a number of these
trailers, by which the delivery capacity of our
plant can be immediately increased, so efficient
ly and economically.
We have been satisfied in every respect.
Yours very truly,

A special grand jury session will not
be necessary to return indictments
against the 35 Russian Molokans who
failed to register under the selective
draft order is the opinion of Assistant
United States District Attorney J. H.
Langston. It is the belief of Attorney
Langston that the men can be present
ed by information although it will be
necessary to try the cases by a trial
jury.
Failure to register for the selective
draft constituted a misdemeanor rather
than a felony because the maximum
punishment was placed at one year
and in case of a misdemeanor, it is not
necessary to secure indictments by a
grand jury before presenting prisoners
in court.
A special session of the federal court
will probably be held in this city some
time during July providing satisfactory
arrangements can be made. At this
special session, the Molokans and other
"slackers" will undoubtedly be tried.
Judge Sawtelle of the federal court
of this district will be unable to con
duct court in Phoenix during July and
to insure the special session of the
court it will be necessary to secure the
services of a federal judge from some
other districts. Efforts are now being
made to this end in order that all such
cases can be speedily disposed of.

This is Red Cross week and it has
started off in splendid style with a
single donation of $750. Now the Red
Cross chapter is looking for a gift of
$1,000, and expects to get it, too, for the
general public well appreciates that
the soldiers of the United States must
be cared for on the battle front and it is
the Red Cross which does this essential
work.
Several people have stated that when
they receive their Liberty bonds, they
intend to give them to the Red Cross,
thus in a most practical manner help
ing out the good and tremendously im
portant work which the national mercy
organization will be called upon to do
for the soldiers.
All over the Salt River valley the call
has gone forth for rallies for the Red
Cross. Mesa is to have a meeting and
another has been called for Tempe.
Other cities and villages will not be
behind for all appreciate that Arizona,
having done its bit and more for the
Liberty Loan, is not going to be be
hindhand for the Red Cross.
The president has asked the United
States to raise $100,000,000 for the Red
Cross and there is no doubt that the
people, knowing that a dollar given may
save a soldier's life, will respond nobly
to this appeal to them.

The temperature on the streets yes
terday was 110. In the Columbia the

ceptionally good. Olga Petrova's
great success, "Panthea," featuring

Dorothy Bernard and Jack Sherrell in
"The Accomplice," and a single reel

Pauline Frederick at Lamara
Made famous by a statue for which
she posed and by poems inspired by
her wonderful beauty, Daudet's famous
character "Sapho" voluntarily chose to
give up all the fame and notoriety which
might have been hers to live in semi
poverty for the sake of Jean Gaussin,
the young student.
Pauline Frederick, in the Famous
Players-Paramount adaptation of the
world-famous story, has drawn a life
like portrait of this girl, uneducated,
unrefined and yet the inspiration for
some of the greatest men and artists
of the time. What was it that fascinated
her throng of admirers, that brought
all of Paris to her feet and yet at the
end drove her to leave all splendor and
luxury for the self-sacrificing career of
a Red Cross nurse? The answer will
appear on the screen of the Lamara
theater today. The Burton Holmes
Travelogue will also be shown.

cooks, and the fun starts the moment
they go to work. Art Uline, as the
owner of the American Kitchen, has
his hands full with the two cooks.
George von Blix will be seen as a
tough character. The rest of the cast
includes Miss Lillian Rose, Alice Vin
cent, Blanche DuBois and the beauty
chorus in songs and dances. The
wardrobe will be of the best.
On June 28 Ed Gilbert, known as

"Millionaire's Double" at Hip

If your wife ran away with another,
if you were sandbagged by a burglar
and had your overcoat stolen, and the
burglar was later killed and thrown
into the river and your coat was the
means of leading people to believe that
you were dead, would you come back
and watch a bunch of society crooks
try to steal your fortune. Then if they
saw the resemblance between you and
the man they thought dead would
you side in with them and help to rob
yourself? That's just what Lionel
Barrymore did in "The Millionaire's
Double," which finishes at the Hip
today and tonight. With the feature
is shown for the final times also the
fourteenth episode of "The Great Se
cret."
Tomorrow comes "The Sixteenth
