NATIONAL GUARD WILL
GIVE SOCIAL SMOKER
Companies A and B Plan to Meet
Business Men at Festive Board.
That the business men of Phoenix
and the members of the two local
national guard companies may es
tablish closer relationships and ac
quire better understanding of the
ideas of the one and the needs of the
other, a smoker has been arranged
by companies A and B, First in
fantry, to be given in Melczer hall
next Monday evening. Today invi
tations will be sent out to merchants
and citizens engaged in commercial
pursuits and every effort will be
made to arouse such interest in the
affair as will result in bringing out
one of the largest and most repre
sentative gatherings of its kind in
many months.
To many citizens the companies
of national guard are looked upon
in much the same light as though
they were simply social organizations
or clubs. Their real purposes and
aims are lost to those not familiar
with the workings of the guards
men's organizations. It is believed
that while the smoker of next Mon
day night is designed as a social
affair, there will be shown to those
outside the organizations that there
is a well-defined purpose behind the
social end of the companies.
Heretofore many local guardsmen
have found it difficult to secure per
mission to absent themselves from
their employment in order that they
might be in attendance at the an
nual maneuvers in which the regu
lars and the national guardsmen join.
If it can be shown the employers
that much good in a many-fold man
ner is to be derived from these an
nual encampments, it is believed that
they will take more kindly to the
idea of allowing their employes to
absent themselves from their work.
The smoker of Monday night will
be presided over by Col. J. H. Mc
Clintock, acting in the capacity of
toastmaster. There will also be ad
dresses of an impromptu nature by
the invited guests. Music will be
furnished by a male quartette and it
goes without saying that the re
freshments will be both pleasing and
satisfying.

TOO MANY HEIRS.
Jockey Ransch Threatens to Thin
Them Out.
Los Angeles, May 24.—Jay Ransch,
at one time a noted jockey on the
English turf, is in jail tonight on a
concealed weapon charge, following an
alleged threat to kill his six-year-old
niece, Kissie Ransch. The child is
said to be co-heir with the former
jockey to a large fortune belonging
to Mrs. E. M. Scholl, who lies at the
point of death at a hotel which she
owns in this city.
Mrs. Scholl, who is the mother of
Ransch, claims to have been attached
to the racing stables of the late King
Edward and that of Alfred Vander
bilt. Ransch was arrested just as he was
leaving the apartments of his mother.
The detectives found a large auto
matic revolver in his pocket. Accord
ing to the physicians of Mrs. Scholl,
he had used this not only to threaten
the life of the little girl who had been
adopted by the dying woman but had
told his mother that he would kill her
if she did not cast off the child.
Ransch is said to have been con
cerned in the notorious $3,000,000 "turf
scandal in Paris about a year and a
half ago. For his part in that he was
ruled off the turf for life. He came
here with a small fortune.
SULTAN DECORATES AMERICAN.

Recipient Sold Rails Used in Original
Construction of A. T. & S. F. R. R.
Sebastian B. Schlesinger, the com
poser, who was once a Boston mer
chant, has been decorated by the sultan
of Turkey with the order of the Medji
dieh. The honor was bestowed in recogni
tion of his musical attainments and
those of his two daughters.
The Baroness de Reibnitz, now Mme.
Isidore Braggiotti, and Miss Bertha
Schlesinger have inherited the talents
of their father.
The sultan, having heard the whole
family sing at his palace in Constanti
nople, showed his appreciation by or
dering the decoration. Mr. Schlesinger
had left for Italy, where his elder
daughter lives, so the ceremony was
performed by Hon. John G. Leishman,
American ambassador to Rome. This
was all the more appropriate, as Mr.
Leishman was formerly ambassador at
Constantinople.
Mr. Schlesinger has published over
100 songs successfully in three lan
guages—French, English and German.
Among recent compositions are
"L'Heure exquise," "Une Prison,"
"O, Ma Charmante" and "Lettre a Non
non."
Sebastian B. Schlesinger was, in the
'70s, a partner in the well known Bos
ton house of Naylor & Co., iron and
steel merchants. The firm did a large
business in steel rails, and in that way
was interested in the original con
struction of the Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe railroad. Boston Globe.

SENIORS ARE GUESTS
OF THE JUNIOR CLASS
Students, Faculty and Board Mingle
for Night on Equal Footing.
With a total of 100 merry, happy
youths, members of the faculty and
school board, the junior class of the
Phoenix high school last evening ten
dered a reception and banquet to the
senior class in the new Patrick hall.
It was one of the most brilliant school
affairs ever held in Phoenix, both in
point of personnel and gastronomic
qualities. With Justus Goebel acting
as toastmaster and with
"Hang Sorrow; care will kill a cat,
And therefore let's be merry"
as the spirit of the evening, the two
classes and their guests indulged in a
session of deft merrymaking and ju
dicious eating until the bountifully
spread tables were pretty nearly swept
clear.
It was one of those occasions when
position in life was completely forgot
ten and all joined in creating and dis
seminating good fellowship. Through
out the banquet which was served by
Mrs. Turner, Ben Massie's orchestra
discoursed classic and popular selec
tions and furnished music for the
dance which followed and which con
tinued until midnight.
The toasts, a list of which follow,
give a better idea of the real bril
liancy of the oral end of the recep
tion than any pen description could
accomplish.

A WAKE OF RUIN.
Chinese Rioters Leave Flaming Vil
lages Behind Them.
Changsha, May 24.—A messenger
who arrived here from Yi Yang re
ports that one hundred houses have
been burned by mobs. The officials
have fled and the town is at the mercy
of the rioters. The telegraph wires
have been cut and details are lacking.
Bands of rioters have advanced
along the main road and are moving
northward. Several villages have been
entirely destroyed.

CROSS COUNTRY BY AEROPLANE
Paulhan Is as Much at Home in the
Air as a Sailor Is at Sea.
Louis Paulhan is a daring cross
country flyer, who is naturally as
much at home in the air as is a sailor
at sea. He and Latham are rivals.
They are of the same age, their sheds
are only a few yards apart, both
commenced to fly at the same period,
and both are unusually skilled. Paul
han, an ordinary mechanic who would
have remained unknown but for the
aeroplane, graduated in the dirigible
balloon service. From a youth he
was connected with airships; even
when he accomplished his compul
sory military service, he was in the
dirigible balloon corps.
He built a model aeroplane and
was later provided with a man-
carrying flyer. From the first he
showed a preference for high alti
tudes. When flying before the presi
dent of the republic at Juvisy in the
late fall of 1909, he broke away from
the aerodrome, flew over the Seine,
the highroads packed with automo
biles, and the market gardens. Then
he returned and landed within a few
feet of the presidential box.
Later he made a trip from the avia
tion ground of Chalons to the mili
tary town of the same name, eighteen
miles away. There was a strong
breeze behind him when he started,
making possible a speed of sixty
miles an hour, at which rate the au
tomobiles, obliged to follow the sinuo
sities of the road, were unable to fol
low. A circuit of the town was made,
thus giving an object lesson to the
military occupants of the ease with
which all their fortifications could
have been discovered and their plans
laid bare. W. F. Bradley in Outing.
o
ORIGIN OF ENGLISH FASHIONS.
It would be interesting to trace the
progress of fashion in England from
the days of King Alfred, when, com
merce having extended the arts and
sciences and opened up communica
tion with the rest of the world, men
began to grow rich and women to
study the art of dress.
For some centuries England set her
own fashions, indeed, it would appear
that it was not until after the French
Revolution that Parisians began to set
the fashion for English women. Once
more the signs of the times seem to
point to a growing desire in this
country to originate our own modes—
a desire which the leading London
firms are happily in a position to en
courage. From the Gentlewoman,
London.
o
THE FEMININE MAJORITY.
An interesting discussion of the
woman problem in England is printed
in the Springfield Republican. It seems
that the surplusage of women inhabi
tants over men in England is very
large and still increasing. It rises in
part from the fact that so many young
men have emigrated to the colonies.
There is a movement on foot to pro
mote the colonization of English wom
en, but especially young women of
high culture. The condition seems to
be that there are more educated wom
en than there is suitable work for
them. English ladies become dress
makers and milliners and go into
shopkeeping of various kinds, but in
the colonies there is a demand for the
higher forms of work that they are
able to do.
Naturally enough, it is said, the
women object to being turned out of
their own country, and hold it is their
right to remain in the land rich in
associations and the atmosphere of cul
ture which means more to them, ap
parently, than to the young men who
have gone forth sturdily to the fron
tiers of civilization.
THE BOY WHO FORGETS.
I love him, the boy who forgets!
Does it seem such a queer thing to
say?
Can't help it; he's one of my pets—
Delightful at work or at play.
I'd trust him with all that I own,
And know neither worries nor frets;
But the secret of this lies alone
In the things that the laddie forgets.
He always forgets to pay back
The boy who has done him an ill;
Forgets that a grudge he owes Jack,
And smiles at him pleasantly still.
He always forgets ’tis his turn
To choose what the others shall play;
Forgets about others to learn
The gossipy things that “they say.”
He forgets to look sulky and cross
When things are not going his way;
Forgets some one's gain is his loss;
Forgets, in his worktime, his play.
So this is why I take his part;
Why I say he is one of my pets;
I repeat it with all of my heart;
I love him for what he forgets!
—St. Nicholas.
