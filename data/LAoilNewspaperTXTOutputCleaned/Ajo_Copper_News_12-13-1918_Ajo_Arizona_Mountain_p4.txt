CHANCE FOR YOU IN THE
NAVY NOW, YOUNG MAN
The Navy Mobilization Office,
742 Market Street, San Francisco,
has received telegraphic in
structions from the Navy De
partment, Washington, D. C., to
continue its efforts to secure deck
and engineer officer material for
induction into the naval service.
Engineer officer material will be
assigned to the U. S. Navy Steam
Engineering School located at
Stevens Institute of Technology,
Hoboken, N. J.
With the signing of the armistice
last month, the emergency
which made necessary the original
call for engineers and deck
officers did not cease to exist, but,
on the contrary, was greatly in
creased. The country is now
faced with the colossal task of
returning its “Victory Boys” as
speedily as possible, consistent
with safety and personal comfort.
This is the task which the Navy
is now called upon to accomplish,
and it can best be done with the
cooperation of every man qualified
for a commission in these
branches of naval service.
The U. S. Navy Steam Engi
neering School is open to men be
tween the ages of 20 and 40, who
meet the physical requirements
of the navy for line officers, who
are of thorough ability and officer-
like character, and who have
completed an engineering course
(mechanical, electrical, civil, mining,
or chemical), at certain recognized
technical schools, or who
possess an education and experience
along steam engineering
lines adjudged equivalent thereof.
The course consists of five
months of intensive training
comprising both technical and
practical.
A graduate of this school will
be commissioned an Ensign in
the Naval Reserve Force, (Pay
$1,700 per annum, plus allow
ances for sea duty and depend
ents). The duty to which a grad
uate of this school will be as
signed will be that of engineer
officer in the Auxiliary Branch of
the Navy for service on cargo
carrying vessels and troop trans
ports.
Properly qualified applicants
will be individually inducted into
the Naval Reserve Force, and on
being assigned to the School, will
be rated Chief Machinist Mate,
and will draw the pay of that ra
ting ($3 a month, plus allow
ances for subsistence, depend
ents, and uniform) during the
course of instruction.
Particularly desirable oppor
tunities are presented to the
trained engineer, in that he is en
abled to supplement his schooling
and practical experience
along technical lines by an in
tense applied course of engineer
ing which gives him an opportunity
for patriotic service during
the emergency with good prospects
for advancement in rank.
Application may be made to the
Navy Mobilization Stations, 742
Market Street, San Francisco;
Union Oil Building, Seventh and
Spring Streets, Los Angeles; or
American Bank Building, Fifth
and Broadway, San Diego, for in
duction for assignment to this
school.
One of the prettiest of the
Christmas windows is that of the Ajo
Drug Store. Man, better not let your
wife or sweetheart see the dainty display!
