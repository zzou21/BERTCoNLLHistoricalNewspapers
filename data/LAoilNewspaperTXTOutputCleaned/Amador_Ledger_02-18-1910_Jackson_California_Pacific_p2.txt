REGISTRATION DELUSIONS.

As much misunderstanding exists in regard to the effect
of registering as a republican or democrat, it is not out of
place to make the subject as plain as possible. An idea
prevails that if a voter is registered as a republican, he must
vote the straight ticket of the party to which he claims
affiliation not only at the primary election, but also at the
general election. If this position were correct, it would of
course deter hundreds of both republicans and democrats
from declaring their party affiliation when registering.
Indeed, the officials have been informed that if such action
was required of the voter he would refuse to register as
identified with any political party. A citizen values his
right of independent action more highly than his enrollment
under the banner of any party. The truth is, however, that
the individual surrenders not one jot of his independence
as a sovereign voter by registering under a party name. He
can scratch to his heart's content when he goes into the booth
in November to make up his ticket. He need not cast his
ballot for a single candidate in his party column if he so
elects. Further than this, the same freedom extends to the
primary election in August. At that time a registered
democrat, for instance, will be given by the election officers
the party ballot containing the names of all candidates of his
party for the party nomination for the various offices. He
is not compelled to vote for the printed names thereon. He
can go outside of the printed list, yes—outside of his party
ranks if he pleases in his selection of candidates. He can do
this by writing the names of the persons of his choice in the
blank spaces left for that purpose. This was done at the
primaries for the municipal election in San Francisco. It
will be remembered that Heney was the regular democratic
nominee for district attorney. And yet he came within a few
votes of being defeated by Fickert, a candidate of the
opposing parties, for the nomination on his own ticket.
Under the existing law, it is possible for the democratic
primaries to select a republican as the nominee on that
ticket, or vice versa. For example, Judge Wood, our present
superior judge, will unquestionably be the republican
candidate to succeed himself. He has many admirers in the
democratic ranks, who will prefer him for that position to
any man within their own party. There is no reason why
they should not express such preference at the democratic
primaries. By writing his name on the democratic ballots
they have the right to make him the democratic nominee for
judge, and thereby eliminate all opposition from a party
standpoint.

ABATING AN EVIL.

The printing of addresses on envelopes for private parties
or corporations by the post-office department is to be stopped.
This interference on the part of the government with the
printing business has been going on for many years on a
gigantic scale, taking millions of dollars every year
from printers scattered over every state and territory in the
United States. How the unfair competition has been
maintained for such a lengthened period in the face of strong
opposition is an enigma. Every country postmaster in the
Union has been converted under this system into a solicitor
for printing business against local printing offices, for the
sake of the commission allowed for securing orders. Of
course, the local printers could not compete with the govern
ment as regards price, the stamped envelopes being furnished
to customers in lots of 500 or over for a trifle over the cost.
Last year a general protest against the outrage went up
from all over the country, and a demand that the govern
ment cease this practice. A committee of Congress, after a
thorough investigation, has decided to recommend that it be
discontinued. We presume, therefore, that in a short time
there will be no more printing of addresses on envelopes
under government supervision. Every printing office will
feel the beneficial effects of this repeal of an unrighteous in
terference on the part of the government with private enter.

HIS GOOD NAME

HARRY C. ERNE

[Copyright, 1910, by American P. < ■** Afm*
elation.]
Van Rastle was a gentleman who
had struck a streak of bad luck. He wore a threadbare suit, a hat with a
hole in the top, and his trousers were
much frayed. Nevertheless, he
himself that a gentleman in rags with his
breeding would always be, and
It was recognized so where he had been
brought up. But Van Rastle decided
to try his luck in the West, and
when he came to that country, where
pedigree is not considered, he found
himself on the same social bus as a
stage driver or a cowboy.
Van Rastle was prospecting on Clear
creek, in Colorado. One night while sleeping in
the little cabin he had thrown together for ten-
dollar protection he was awakened by the sound of footsteps
without. Presently he saw where his
door was a streak of perpendicular
light and he saw that the door was being
opened. In a few moments the
light had become a square, in the cen-
ter of which was a crouching figure. It
crept into the cabin and had its
hand on the few dollars Van Rastle
possessed when the matter came to a
crisis by Van Rastle ordering him to
throw up his hands.
The next scene was a western court
room, the judge sitting on the typical
dry goods box. The prisoner, an ill
favored young man with a crafty eye,
stood apart. The Judge addressed the
prisoner:
"Now, then, Tom Baker, what you
been trying to rob this man for?"
"Hain't I got a right to plead guilty
or not guilty?" asked the prisoner.
"Oh, you been tried so many times
you know a lot about law, don't you?"
"Reckon I pleads not guilty."
"How air you going to prove such rot
as that?"
"I don't need to prove it. You got
to prove that I robbed him."
"Waal, that's easy. Step up, Mr."—
"Van Rastle," the witness supplemented with some of his former pride
in his name.
"What's that first part of it?"
"Van."
"Well, Mr. Dan Hustler, tell how
this galoot robbed you."
"I heard a step without"—
"How didn't you know it wasn't a
painter?" Interrupted the accused.
"Then my door opened," continued
the witness, "and I saw the figure of
the prisoner."
"How did you know it was him?"
"He crawled in and had his hand on
my money."
"His money, judge! Jes' 's if a mis
able looking coyote like that ever had
any money!"
Sir. Van Rastle winced.
"I ordered him to throw up his
hands. He did so, and, grabbing him
by the collar"—
"Judge, he's got to prove I had a
coat on! I hain't got no coat and nary
collar to my shirt."
"Then I marched him down here to
Empire and turned him in to the com
mittee." "I hold you, Tom Baker," said the
judge sternly, "It was easy 'nuff to
prove you done it."
"Mightn't I have the witness?" asked
the prisoner?
"Have the witness! Ho. You got his
money. What d'you want him for?"
"I want to cross examine him."
"Oh! More law talk, eh? Well, go
ahead."
"What's yer name," Dan?"
"Peter Stuyvesant Van Rastle."
"D'ye hear that, Judge? He admits
he's by occupation a rustler."
Then followed questions as to the
witness' age, place of residence—in
deed, everything the prisoner could
think of. Finally the Judge stopped
the questioning with:
"You, Tom Baker, shut up! Yer
thinking you air a-running this case in
stead o' me. How many times you been
in jail?"
"S'pose I hey been in jail, Judge.
Didn't you never read any stories in
the newspapers telling how an innocent man went to jail because one of
his pals turned state's evidence and
swore him away?"
"This hain't no sich case, Tom Ba
ker. You was caught in the act."
"Who caught me? This yere rustler
says he caught me, but how you going
to believe him? Hain't my word 's
good as hisn?"
The judge looked puzzled.
"Tom Baker," he said presently,
"what 'd you go and mix me all up
for?"
"I didn't mix you up, Judge. I just
set you right. How do you know what
crimes he's committed?"
The Judge looked at Van Rastle sus
piciously.
"Stranger," he said, "hey you—hey
you"—
He paused. He was trying to say
something that he couldn't get out.
Then a sudden thought struck him.
"Tom Baker," he said, "you go 'long.
And if ever you are brought up before
this yere court again I'll turn you over
to the committee to lift you where the
grass's too short for yer toes to tread
on."
The prisoner went away jubilant.
Van Rastle, dismayed at the course the
trial had taken, stood irresolute whether to make a protest or go to his cabin
without saying anything. After all
but he and the Judge had left the room
the Judge said to him.
"Dan Rustler, I want to explain.
That Tom Baker's one of the sharpest
rascals in these mountains. If I hadn't
shifted him off he'd a brought out yer
whole record."
