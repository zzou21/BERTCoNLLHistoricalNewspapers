PHOENIX, ARIZONA. APRIL, 27, 1902.
As expected, in the suit of Thomas
Wilson against Governor Murphy and
former Auditor Vickers
THE Judge Kent yesterday
sustained the demurrer
interposed by the attorneys for the gover
nor, and overruled the demurrer of the
ex-auditor. As The Republican has
stated all along, not only was there
no fraud against the territory or anybody else in the issuance of the
warrants in controversy, but there was
not even a technical reason for calling
into question any act of the governor
in the premises. Judge Kent ac
cordingly held that the action against
the governor was improper, and had
the case been on trial on the merits he
could properly have stated that Eugene
Ives, in bringing the action, was
prompted only by the lowest motives
known to a cur. Ives knew from the
beginning that the governor was invul
nerable, and his entire proceeding
against both officials has been a grand
stand play for personal and political
purposes.
In overruling the demurrer inter
posed by the attorneys of former
Auditor Vickers, the court merely
"cleared the deck for action." Mr.
Vickers has repeatedly stated that he
wished the case tried on its merits
at the earliest possible moment, and
when the demurrers were argued, his
attorney, Mr. Morrison, specifically
stated in open court that his client
was not relying upon the demurrer for
his defense.
But note the consistency of the
Democratic press controlled by Ives.
For weeks his organs have been howl
ing that action on the demurrers
would not settle the issues, and that
the merits of the case could only be
brought out on trial. Now that the
court has decided that there was tech
nical ground for the action, Ives'
vicious organs rush to make the state
ment that the court upheld Ives' con
tention that the warrants were illegal
ly drawn. Even the ordinary citizen
with but little knowledge of court pro
cedure, knows that when a demurrer is
interposed the contentions of the plain
tiff are technically admitted for the
time being, but the plaintiff's conclu
sions as to the law are denied. No
court would pretend to pass upon the
merits of the facts involved until the
facts in question had been fully
brought out in trial and the law duly
applied thereto. Judge Kent, in pass
ing upon the demurrer of the ex-
auditor, merely says in effect, "If the
facts are as stated by the plaintiff, he
has a ground for action, and the trial
must proceed to determine whether
the plaintiff's allegations and con
clusions are well founded." And that
is all there is to it. The judge is care
ful to make this point clear. In
closing his decision upon the technical
points at issue, he states that "there
fore, so far as this DEMURRER is
concerned, the complaint as to these
causes of action is sufficient."

The case against Mr. Vickers will
now go to trial, and the merits will be
determined without delay, so far as
he and his attorneys are concerned.
In view of the lies repeated by Ives
and his organs over and over again,
it is proper to state to the citizens of
Arizona once more that of all the
money covered by the warrants in
question, the territory got full value
for every dollar. Not one cent was
fraudulently expended and Ives knows
it as well as anybody in Arizona. Not
only that, but every dollar was ex
pended strictly for the very purpose
had in view by the legislature which
made the appropriations. The Repub
lican speaks by the card, for its pro
prietor was the auditor who issued the
warrants. Not only did the territory
receive full value for every dollar ex
pended, but the expenditures were de
cided as legal by the assistant attor
ney general of the United States for
the department of the interior; and
also by the attorney general of the
territory of Arizona, the only author
ized legal adviser of territorial officers.
And the courts will uphold the legal
ity of every warrant when the facts
are brought out.
Under the terms of a bill now pend
ing in congress the government would
be empowered, in the
ARMY AND
NAVY INVENTORS.
event of its enactment into law, to take possession of any and all
inventions or improvements in naval or military equipment
made by persons in the army or navy,
paying such compensation as might be
allowed by a court of claims. With
the recent noteworthy expansion of the
federal military and naval establish
ments there has come an accession of
activity in the field of warlike inven
tion. New weapons, devices of equip
ment and details of armament appear
in rapid succession, and if once adopted
by the government bring fortune if not
fame to the lucky inventor.
There is, of course, ample ground for the as
sumption on which the proposed legis
lation is founded that the government
is entitled to a first call on any novelty
of this class. Sometimes an important
invention will be donated, as was the
disappearing gun carriage; but fre
quently the inventor retires from the
service, to reappear later at the head
of a corporation organized to promote
his discovery and secure fat govern
ment contracts.
It is desirable, on all accounts, that
the bright minded men in the army
and navy who devote themselves to intricate problems of warlike invention
should remain in the public service.
Great conflicts between nations in the
future will be won by the possession of
the best tools of war; and in making
these we are by no means pre-eminent
as yet. There has been little opportu
nity for experiment on a large and
practical scale, and even less legisla
tive disposition to sanction costly tests
and investigations, which old world
powers regard as necessary and indis
pensable. Now that the government
has become so promising a customer,
indeed, favored private enterprise has
not infrequently succeeded in relegat
ing the man of ideas and inventive
skill to the background. Instead of a
reward for promotion, superior inven
tive skill is likely to prove a draw
back and an obstacle to an officer un
ambitious of a distinguished professional
career.
The proposition that the less expert
and original an incumbent of high sta
tion may be, the better qualified is be
to take judicious action, still finds sup
porters in private and official life. It
has been urged against General B..;zier,
chief of ordnance in the military
establishment, that he ought not in be
a member of the board of ordnance and
fortification which selects and adopts
ordnance materiel, because, forsooth,
he is the inventor of a disappearing gun
carriage. It is nothing to the point,
apparently, that General B..;zier
turned over to the government all
rights in his invention, without a dollar
of compensation. He is an inventor
and an ordnance expert—and that
seems to be enough to keep him off the
very board. Of all others, for which his
tastes, training and acquirements fit
him most distinctively.

[paragraphs] lately in the passage of the
[spect?] showing new... [illegible] have been deciphered already.
The raw sugar is accumulating in the
hands of planters, who are holding on
to their property until the last possible
chance of access to the American
market on better terms. As a result of
postponed action the raw crop is
likely to be pushed upon the market at
once and sold for what it will fetch.
The trust will reap the advantage. The
planters will be ruined.
Habits are like porous planters easy
to acquire, but hard to get rid of.

APPRECIATED AROUND.
The Republican takes pleas

morning to its new Los Angeles

appreciation of this paper by
advertisers abroad. It is rec
ognized by them to be without

lation and general excellence.

volume this season than ever
before.
LITTLE JAMES
(The Rapid and Extraordinary Development of the Fourth Ward.)
Th' Fourth Ward is so crowded now
with fine an' intelligent voters an'
[conscience?] of street improvements in the regular
inhabitance of th' Ward can't hardly
git their breaths an' they say they
wisht th' election was over. Th'
taxpayers sez they druther not have
any Councilman f'um that ward, th'
lection's so much trouble an' expense.
This year th' Young People's
[Council?] streets at the rate of $1,000 dollars a
month. Next year they'll find they cut
their grade down to low, an' just before
th' election they'll hire a lot of voters
to fill 'em up again. Th' tax
payers sez if this here perpetual rais
in' an' lowerin' th' grade of the Fourth
Ward is to be goin' on forever they
druther pay fer havin' th' streets
paved with McAdam or asphalt or
somethin' else that can't be moved
easy.
There's one thing th' Fourth Ward
folks are proud of, an' that's
that th' Ward is more Populist 'n they
thought it was. Sez they: "It seems there's
about a hundred of us voters an' we
didn't think we had more'n half that
many. Some of our citizens ain't
quite as progressive an' prominent an'
permanent as we'd like to have 'em,
but sich as they are, they're here now,
an' we got a right to count 'em. It
pears to us as if th' last census was
all wrong. There was lots of natives of
th' glorious Fourth that got over! Joke!
If th' government wants to do th' right
thing by Phoenix at th' next census
it won't hire no enumerators, but the
mathematicians of th' Young People's
Democrat Society, which makes a
special study of figgers. If they
fail to see any of th' inhabitance of th'
Ward it's because they are dead or ain't
here."
The Fourth Ward was always sposed
to be th' littlest wun in Phoenix, but
it's got most as many able bodied
voters into it now as there was in th'
whole town a year ago, and mebbe
more'n it'll have a month -slenn. If
all th' other wards 'd come to th'
front like th' Fourth, Phoenix will be th'
biggest town of its size on earth.
Th' Fourth Ward is a great hive of
industry. Which ever way one looks
he sees men standin' around armed
with picks an' shovels. They don't work
by fits an' spells an' jokes, but just keep
at it about so hard all th' time.
A taxpayer was standin' around
watchin' th' laborers an' gettin' more'n
more nervous because he thought they wasn't
serious work. He sez to Captin
Joseph Anxler Busch, sez he, "I don't
see, don't it me as if us taxpayers was
intendin' t' lose mo' of our money?"
Captin Busch he sez, "These here hon
est workin' men are savin' money for
Phoenix every minute. They're busy
enjoyin' sun strokes an' savin' doctors' bills that the city's haf t' pay.
You can easily afford to pay a man $3
dollars a day to keep out of any
of a sun stroke that might cost us a
hundred dollars."
