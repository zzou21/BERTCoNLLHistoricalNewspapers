PHOENIX, ARIZONA, MAY 12, 1901.

We observe with sincere regret the
political editorial paucity of the Ariz
ona. Citizen and the void he left by the withdrawal
of the name of the managing editor. Mr.
O'Brien Moore, fills us
with an almost physical pain. Of our
mental anguish there can be no doubt.
The void is, after all more apparent
than real. Mr. Moore's name is still
there but the big, bold capitals in
which it was wont to be displayed
are gone. And
again, what's in the type in which it's
printed? The cause of our woe is the
shortening of the editorial column and
the diversion of the purpose of the
new Citizen to elevate Journalism in
Arizona. It started out well in this
noble work and at the time it ceased
lifting, an additional altitude of per
haps three and one-quarter inches by
actual measurement had been at
tained.
Mr. Moore came from the east and
his business partner from China with
a noble determination to head off the
ebb of Bryanism which set in last No
vember. No Journal in all this land
stood truer to Mr. Bryan in his falling
fortune than the Arizona Citizen, and
there seemed a chance yet for the res
cuing of its name from oblivion. Even
some of the contumely was being wiped
off of Pettigrew and we believe that if
the Citizen had been allowed to pursue
its glorious career the "Third battle"
might have been fought. But the Citi
zen has quit. In the language of the
race track it has "thrown up its hat,"
though Mr. Moore was commonly un
derstood to be its head. It has fore
sworn politics and the redemption of
the democratic party, and has gone in
for sociological reform, or else is en
gaged in booming the manufacture of
playing cards.
Under the title of "Sin and Amuse
ment," the Citizen in its latest issue,
which arrived at this office, concludes
in a half column editorial that card
playing, if carried on in a proper en
vironment, is healthful and even en
nobling. We expect our other demo
cratic Tucson contemporary, the Star,
of moral, if not religious tendencies, to
take issue with the Citizen on this
point. Bryanism, meanwhile, will
languish and the press of Arizona will
sink back to the depths in which Mr.
Moore found it some thirty days ago.
President McKinley touched the
sympathetic nerve in the most cordial
receptions which mark
ed his journey through
New York, the Empire State of
Texas. Texas, and in the ex
change of messages with the
president at El Paso, the gateway of
Mexico, which was its consummation,
when he observed at Austin that Texas
was "the highway of the Pan-American
movement in industry and com
merce," and well as the nearest of the
states to the Spanish-speaking peo
ples with whom "there exists a feeling
of good will and amity."
When the presidential party entered
Texas it entered a field which has a
history stirring and distinct. It has
memories of its own that only the
progress of time and the dawning of
other memories have withdrawn from
the lists of controversy; in their day,
those events were themes of divided
feeling between the ante-bellum north
and the ante-bellum south, as well as
between the two republics. That they
can be turned into skillful allusion and
that the president can meet in spirit
his veteran brother magistrate over
the waters that separate the two na
tions is due, as he has said, to the
propaganda of "good will and amity"
toward the Spanish-Americas.
It is recognized by Mexico in that
exchange of greeting on the banks of
the Rio Grande that America is now
her best friend as well as her nearest
neighbor. The memories of Chapul
tepec are wiped out by the memories
of that stern demand from the Wash
ington government which evicted
France and empire from the republic
together. In Mexico as well as in
Cuba, the United States has inter
vened in the cause of Independence,
and under the protection of the Mon
roe doctrine the vigorous trunk of the
republic has grown until out of all the
Latin states it is the best planted.
There has been a good feeling be
tween this country and Mexico for a
generation, but the tangible illustra
tion which it has just received is a
timely commentary on the attempt
of old world enterprises to awaken
distrust between us and it now.
Mr. Russell Sage benevolently ex
plains that the "calls" that he has
made and have been sent him
have been quite cheerfully returning to him.
These were for the purpose of inducing
activity in the market and enabling
worthy young men to make money
and help support their families. Mr.
Sage is a truly benevolent man and
meant to help the poor to drive the
wolf from the door.
Some of the missionaries to China
think that Mark Twain will never un
derstand the situation till he is sent
out there as a missionary himself.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to
send him. Nobody knows what he
would convert the Chinese to except
that it wouldn't be Christian Science.
Mr. H. G. Wells, the novelist, is
said to be so much addicted to writing
that he often forgets to eat. Now, if
some of the novelists would become so
much addicted to eating that they
would forget to write the world would
feel that the matter was properly
balanced.
Those stupid Russians think the
likin duties about which we are hear
ing so much are just obligations to
keep on licking Chinamen, in season
and out of season.
Progress has lived in vain when a
Canadian magistrate is able to say,
"I don't know anything about Michi
gan."
The original gold brick man is to be
buried at the expense of his friends.
Really it pays to be honest.
One of the western improvements
that the mikado has annexed is a
large, up-to-date business panic.
The western habit of pulling a gun
at secret society initiations has its
good points.
Wall street has its feet in the stocks
—clear up to the ears.
John Dough rules the under-cut.

"Oh, he wasn't runnin'," sez Paw. "You ort to keep a closer track of current events. Mac's a hold-over an' lives in the second ward." "I thought he lives in Washington," sez Maw. "I thought you meant McNenl." says Paw. "I meant McKinley," sez Maw. "I got a glimpse of him once," sez Paw. "He was surrounded by rough riders an' rowdies an' members of the community, but I guess he made his speech, I was too busy to see."

HOW IT IS AT BEAUMONT.
One of the Vanderbilts dropped a
penny on the floor of a hotel a few
days ago and at once went down on his
knees to hunt for it. That was the way
his family became possessed of so much
money. Now at Beaumont, according
to the dispatches, there are few men
who would even stretch out their arm
for a living five-dollar bill. But they
have their fortunes to make there and
are in a hurry. Dallas News.

arism. They do not affect the city
citizens to the same extent, because the
business is limited, and persons who
go out for pleasure occasionally do not
feel the burden of the nuisance to the
same extent, though they contribute
largely to the receipts of the toll road
companies. This is a tax on trade as well as an archaic in
stitution, which does not reflect credit
on the community. Ottawa Citizen.
QUESTIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT.
President McKinley, it is said, will
try to build up a white man's repub
lican party in the south. How can he
do it without abandoning the black
man? Indianapolis News
FIGHTING BATTLES O'ER AGAIN.
The Mineral Wealth's silly insinu
tion that anyone influenced the Sun
advocate editorially the ceasing of the
fight to retain the territorial Hamilton
paper has yet made, and it has made a number of
late. Through a long series of contests
for the betterment of conditions and
for democratic principles the Sun has
at least succeeded in getting a reputa
tion at home among its own people
where prophets are least likely to sec
ure recognition for being dictated to
by no man or class of men. Hence the
little Mohave sheet's dirty fling, which
might otherwise be construed as an in
sult, falls upon deaf ears. Yuma Sun.
COCHISE OVERSHADOWED.
During the short session of congress
Hon. Marcus A. Smith used his utmost
endeavors to secure a favorable report
on a bill allowing Cochise county to re
fund her indebtedness at a lower
rate of interest. The rush of business in re
gard to the Philippines and the river
and harbor bill during the closing days
of congress completely excluded all
other business and he was unable to
secure any action whatever on the bill.
This is one question that will receive
prompt attention at the next session of
congress and Cochise county will be
given an opportunity to unload some
of her bonded debt at a lower rate of
interest. Bisbee Review.
SPREAD OF THE SHAMROCK.
The Irish are going to make their
mark in South Africa, if a firm of
Corkonian seedsmen have their way.
Shortly before St. Patrick's Day this
firm sent to each of the twelve Irish
regiments now serving in Africa a
large package of shamrock seed. Some
of the regiments have planted their
seeds already, but others have been
too busy to do so; but before they leave
South Africa they intend to speckle the
veldt with shamrock. May it grow there
as well as its sons grow wherever thev
take root and that, it seems, in every
where.
YOUNG LIONHEARTS OF FINANCE.
Wall Street, like the bride's father in
the poem, challenges in vain the impet
uous newcomers. It mutters words of
caution and contracts its credits, but
the western men, scorn of cautions,
open up their strong boxes and cry, "On
with the lance!" and as it proceeds
After long period of stagnation and
contraction the country has
for two years plunged forward a gener
ation. The expansion of industries and
the accumulation of wealth are some
thing stupendous. Bankers fifteen hun
dred miles from the Atlantic seaboard
However it may end, this movement
has revealed the fact that a London
or Paris lending money on call in Wall
street and commission brokers get orders
to buy and ship blocks of securities to
investors in towns they never heard of.
The course of financial empire has taken its way with a
vengeance! The inflation of values
and expansion of credits have been
enormous. Every thoughtful person
recognizes the danger of a "scare" in
such a situation, but the optimistic
throng cries, "There isn't a cloud in the
sky!" and scoffs at all warnings and
the end is not in sight. New York
Herald.
THE FAR FLUNG BATTLE LINE.
A point which was brought out to
Great Britain's great disadvantage, as
a world power, in the interesting
speech of Gen. Jas. H. Wilson, at the
Loyal Legion banquet, recently, is the
necessity which the wide extension of
her world-operations put her under of
being represented in serious emergen
cies by inferior Indian soldiery, accord
ing to the Mail and Express. Afghans
and Hindoos turned out poor stuff in
China, when contrasted with good
white troops. And now Mr. Brodrick,
the English war secretary, is making
speeches to remind Great Britain that
she must be "quite ready to fight on the
Nile, the Yang-tse, the Orange river or
the Indus." England has generally
been equal to the emergencies she has
been placed in, but it must be admitted
that her far flung base is necessarily
getting a little thin in spots. Mr. Brodrick says that the British
army must be improved without any
delay whatever. There is a hint of the
solution in his attitude, if not in
his words.
WHIRL OF THE WORLD.
Rev. Luke Evers, rector of St. An
drew's church, Fleet street, has re
ceived permission from the holy father,
through the Congregation of the Prop
aganda, to have mass celebrated in his church at 2:30 a. m. on
Sundays and holidays. This mass will
be for the particular benefit of the men
employed in the big newspaper offices
which are situated about a stone's
throw from St. Andrew's church.
The reverend vicar reports that a con
veyor on the great morning daily is un
finished, which is generally about 2 or
2:30 a. m. His grace favored the prop
osition and the approval of his congregation
before inaugurating this unique
practice.
The privilege extended to Father Ev
ers is good for ten years. St. Andrew's
is the only church in the world where
mass may be celebrated at such an
hour. The first mass at 2:30 a. m. was
celebrated on Sunday, May 5.
The Paraguayan war debt fell to $49,607,188 in
1883. It rose to $125,000,000 in 1890.
The somewhat hackneyed "gag" "Put
me off at Buffalo" pains new life and
significance this year, and will doubt
less be the spoken or unspoken desire
of millions.
If a woman is physically miserable
and mentally unhappy, the child she
bears will reflect her own condition.
Every woman who anticipates
motherhood ought to think of this and
be a fair godmother to her own child,
endowing it with health, beauty, and a
happy disposition.
The maternal health is largely the
result of her care. She is nervous, her
appetite fails, she cannot sleep. Restore
the appetite, quiet her nerves and give
her sleep and she becomes a new
woman.
"It has made a new woman of me,"
is the constant testimony of women
who have used Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription. It tranquilizes the
nerves, encourages the appetite and
induces refreshing sleep; it restores
feminine strength and cures weakening
drains. Heals inflammation and ulcer
ation and cures female weakness.
"During the first month, when I looked for
ward to maternity, I could not keep anything
on my stomach," writes Mrs. H. O. Anderson,
South Britain, New Haven Co., Conn. "Was so
weak that I went to bed on the 1st of June and
never got up until the 8th of August. I tried
different doctors, but with little benefit. I read
that many ladies were helped by using your medi
cine, so I thought I would give it a trial. I began
to take your Favorite Prescription in November, and I had a nice little baby girl in
December following. My baby weighed over
eight pounds. I was only ill for about one hour,
and got along nicely during confinement. Was
up and dressed on the eighth day. I never had
the doctor with me at all, just the nurse and one
or two friends. My friends thought I was sick a
very short time. This makes my second child.
With the first one I did not take Favorite Pres
cription. The little one lived just about two
months, and was sick all the time. This
