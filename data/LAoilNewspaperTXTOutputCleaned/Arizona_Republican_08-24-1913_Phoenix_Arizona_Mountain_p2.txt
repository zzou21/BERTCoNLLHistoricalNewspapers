The Ha u m men from Tempo will
arrive in this fair city this afternoon
and play not at Grant Park but the purpose is
thrilling the crowd

Keyed up to the highest pitch of en
thusiasm by their recent victory over
the Tempo team, the Phoenix team will

cavorting through nine m - journey to Mesa this morning to meet
the national pastime with the Brackett battalion on their own

the Maroons, who have the advan- j stamping ground for the purpose of
tage of a Sunday game on the home j whipping out the sting of the defeat
grounds again, two Sundays in suc- i administered by Mr. Fred Brack
cession. The day finds Manager Kaum i et just two weeks ago. Upon that

memorable occasion the Brackett men

in something of a quandary. He
knows that the Maroons are now find
ing their batting eye, and that he
is likely to lose the game, but at the
same time he cannot afford to weaken
his line-up by putting Spikes on the
mound on account of his return game
with Mesa on Thursday, and the prob
abilities of not being able to use
LaRocke in that game because the
Kansan is suffering with a very sore
arm. This throws him back on
Oviedo or Tweed, both good men, but
not in the class with his headliner
pitchers. Oviedo has not shown on
the local grounds for some time and
may be used. If he is, he will work
hard, as he always does, and a good
game will result.

As for the Maroons, the same corn

bination that proved so

against the Phoenix team on last
Sunday afternoon will be used. Smoke
Smiley is going good and will show
excellently with the quality of sup
port that is now being afforded the
pitchers by the Maroons, and then
there is Tommy Clark to fall back
on. The game on the local grounds,
therefore, can be looked forward to
with a great degree of interest both
because of the possibilities of another
defeat for Tempo and because of the
fighting qualities of the Maroons, anyhow.

coming up from behind in the last half
of the ninth inning with Goodman, who
had pitched an unusually good game at
the bat. Honest John Kelly grooved
one over and Goodman politely placed
the same on the reverse side of the "Hi
Ko'd fence", and two men who had
hitherto faced certain smudging on the
bags came gleefully home, while Good
man gathered up his paraphernalia and
started satisfactorily home.
In the game this afternoon, Busted
Mitt Bill Barngrover will try his hand
pitching for the Mesa team, he having
signed up with Manager Brackett yes
terday. It remains to be seen if the
Old Head has enough to get away with
it from the slugging aggregation that

fortunate Phoenix now has. It is known that he

is well aware of the fact that the local
team is one hundred per cent better
than formerly, and it is possible that
the locals will treat Bill with the same
degree of contempt that they experi
enced for LaRocke in Thursday's game.
From a glance at the lineup as pub
lished above, it will be seen that the
same combination exactly will be used
that was used on Thursday. Hall who
showed enough for the most carping
critic on Thursday afternoon after a
hard all night's ride from Bakersfield,
is feeling in excellent shape and prom
ises even better work than at that
time. The Mesa men, however, are.
heavy hitters and may get to him a
little, but he has a strike out record
that is a beaut to fall back on.

ANOTHER CUB VETERAN GOES TO MINORS;
RICHIE'S WORK VERY POOR THIS SEASON

PORTLAND, August 23 The Port
land sluggers hammered the Los An
geles pitchers for a total of sixteen
hits in the game here this afternoon,
obtaining a lead of five runs on the
final score, which was 9 to 4. At no
time was the game anywhere near the
Los Angeles players who were out
classed. Four costly errors added to
the advantage of the Portland terrors.

Replete With Thrills
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23. One of
the largest Saturday crowds of the
season saw Venice tear down Sacra
mento's perfect defense, and fall upon
Jack Lively for enough runs to win
a ninth-inning game. Lively re
tired under the fusillade, but the score
had already been tied and there were
no outs when Kinsella was called to
the rescue. Charlie Sterrett, the lat
est addition to Venice's catching staff,
batting as a pinch hitter, proceeded
to break up the game with a drive
through second scoring the winning
run.
The game was replete with thrills
Snappy fielding and daring base runs

were featured.

Lew Richie.

Another Chicago Cub veteran was discarded a few days ago when a
d'js.1 was put through with the Kansas City club releasing Lew Richie
to the Blues in exchange for Jim Vaughan, the left handed pitcher,
formerly with the New York Yankees, and another American
Association player whose name was refused
Richie was one of the best twirlers in the National league last
year, his record being .667 for the season. This year, however, he made
a very poor showing with the Cubs, winning but two out of the seven,
games in which he pitched.

ANOTHER DUB FIGHT

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
VANCOUVER, August 23. The
elimination contest at the righthouse
arena to decide whether Eddie Moy,
of Allentown, Pa., or Ray Campbell,
of Seattle, should be the opponent of
Willie Ritchie here on Labor Day was
won by the Seattle boy after a lively
fight of ten rounds. Neither fighter
showed any real lightweight class
but they were fairly evenly matched.
Referee Hewett's decision was not
well received. Three times Campbell
had Moy in a bad way from straight
smashes to the jaw. Campbell in
flicted all the punishment and had
Moy hanging on during the last
round. Moy landed a lot of light ones
but was unable to do any damage.
Campbell had the better of the sec
ond, fifth, eighth, ninth and tenth
rounds. In the fourth Campbell
stepped into a blow that caught him
on the nose and the remainder of
the round he was hanging on.
While promoters of the Welsh
Ritchie bout scheduled for September
twentieth say it will take place,
there is a noticeable absence of mon
ey security so far. Welsh sprained
his ankle and as it is still giving him
trouble his manager wishes to wait
until after the Labor Day match be
fore settling matters.

COMPLAINT DISMISSED

National Commission Refuses to Take
Action Against C. Murphy
ST. LOUIS, August 23. President
H. B. Johnson of the American League
today telegraphed the sporting editor
of a local paper that the national
commission could take no further ac
tion on the complaint of Williams
Grayson Jr., former owner of the
Louisville Association team, against
Chas. Murphy, president of the Chi
cago Nationals. Grayson was recently
barred from organized baseball by
the national committee and fined
$500. Grayson then gave out for
publication certain letters which he
claimed exposed Murphy as a violat
or of baseball law.

POWER BOAT RACES AT KEOKUK
KEOKUK, Iowa, Aug. 23 It is gen

week at the annual regatta of the
Mississippi Valley Power Boat asso

opened Tuesday and will be con
tinued until Friday.
Among the contestants are two
new boats entered by Commodore
Blackton of the Motor Boat Club of
America, whose "Baby Reliance III"
broke all existing world's records at
the association regatta at Davenport
last year. The new boats were de
signed to pass the sixty-mile-an-hour
mark. Whether this will be accom
plished remains to be seen, but the
experts who have seen the craft on
trial spins are of the opinion that they
will turn out to be world-beaters.
Another notable entry in the re
