A very serious accident happened in Plymouth on Friday, February 25th. Ike and Tom Long were blasting wood in Plymouth and Ike lit a match, with which to set off a blast, and threw the remains of the lighted match down on the ground in front of him, where he had a box of giant caps.

Isaac and Tom Long, both of this place, met with an awful accident on Friday last, while blasting with giant powder. Isaac, the eldest boy, was holding the box of giant caps, which contained 95, between his knees, while Tom was getting the powder ready to blast with, when Isaac took a piece of fuse, put a cap on it and lit it, intending to throw it away to hear it explode. Either the match or a spark from the fuse dropped in the box of caps, causing them to explode in his face. This caused the giant powder Tom was holding to explode also, throwing him several feet in the air. The Pritchard boys, who were working some distance away, heard the explosion and cries for help, and came to their assistance. They saw how bad they were hurt and came to town and got Rosenwald & Kahn's delivery wagon and some more boys to help, and brought them in town. Dr. W. A. Norman was called in and he did all he could to relieve their suffering. Next morning they were taken to Sutter Creek sanitarium, and are under the care of Dr. Goodman. Last report they were doing nicely. The dance given at Drytown by the Plymouth brass band was a complete success. 29 tickets were sold. After paying all expenses they cleared $15. Margaret Allison, who has been working for Frank Mann, returned to her home in Spring Valley. Several Plymouth people attended the dance in Drytown on Saturday evening last.

Paul Parker of Jackson is visiting his sister, Mrs. H. E. Potter of this place. Wild Roses.
