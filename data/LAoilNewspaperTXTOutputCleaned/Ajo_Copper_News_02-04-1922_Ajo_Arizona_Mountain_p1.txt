do like it, drop in whatever you
think is right.

AJO, PIMA COUNTY, ARIZONA, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1922.

Lon Ferra, Former Ajoite,
Strikes It Rich at Oatman; Gold

Lon Ferra, formerly a resident
of Ajo, has struck it rich at Oat
man, according to all reports.
A dispatch from Oatman to the
El Paso Herald says:
The late strike on the Ben Har
rison claim of the Tom Reed at
Oatman is considered the most sen
sational ever known in the district.
In a surface cutting of a small
cropping, an 18-inch vein sampled
an average of $200 a ton gold;
while from a 6-inch pay streak is
being taken ore that assays up to
$27,000 a ton, with much of it
sacked that averages worth $14 a
pound. Some of the quartz is leaf
covered with gold, as though pour-

ROAD MATTERS—
Tom Smith, connected with the
Gillespie dam company, is here to
day from Phoenix on road matters,
being accompanied by Allie Stout
of Gila Bend.
Secretary Franck of the Chamber
of Commerce has forwarded to
Tucson the road petition requesting
the board of supervisors to declare
a county road, the road from
Gibson to the Maricopa county line
en route to Gila. Maricopa coun
ty will build from Gila to meet
it, commencing work at once and
following the railroad track most
of the way.
The distance from Gibson to the
line is 16 miles.

COL. GREENWAY HERE—
Col. John C. Greenway, general
manager of New Cornelia and of
the C. & A., is in Ajo this week.
He is accompanied by Colonel
Sprague of Chicago, who has a son
here—A. A. Sprague—and who is
a member of the Chicago firm of
Sprague, Warner & Company, whole
sale grocers.
Colonel Sprague's wife, Mrs.
Sprague, is also in the party. They
will be here several days.

COUNTY ENGINEER HERE —
W. C. Lefebvre, county engineer,
was here this week on road busi
ness, accompanied by his assistant,
E. M. Whitworth.
T. J. Jewell has returned from a
trip to Los Angeles.

A FINE LINE OF OIL STOVES
and REFRIGERATORS AT BOOTH’S.

Pat Stanford wishes it stated
through the columns of The
News that a report is untrue he
had heard to the effect that he
would be a candidate for deputy
sheriff in the event of the re
signation of Tom Dolen.
Asked if he had resigned,
Deputy Sheriff Dolen told The
News man he had not and had no
intention of resigning.
Earl and Harry Steele have re
turned from Phoenix. Harry,
who went to consult an eye
specialist, comes back improved.
It was 26 degrees above zero
on the 29th, last Sunday morn
ing, duplicating the record for
the winter of Jan. 20, when it
was also 26. Most Ajoites will be
surprised to know the records
show this, although it was gen
erally conceded that Sunday
was one of the cold days of the
winter so far.

An armed guard has had to be
placed upon the find and the ore.
There is to be milling in the
Tom Reed mill of the lower grade
material. Development at depth is
to be carried on by crosscutting
from the Ollie Oatman air shaft.
The rich ground is under lease
to G. A. Stoney and Alonzo Ferra,
who have rights to 600 feet along
the Ben Harrison and Ollie Oatman
claims and downward for 200 feet.
There is local belief that a perma
nent addition has been made to the
mining ground of the camp, and
there is expectation of return to
the boom times of a few years ago.

JANUARY PRODUCTION—
New Cornelia’s production for the
month of January was 1,602,909
pounds.
The cathodes stacked up in the
yards were also reduced somewhat
during the month, as the ship
ments for January totaled about
5,200,000 pounds.

MINING MAN—
John Caretto, prominent Bisbee
mining man, is here attending to
the assessment work on the Bisbee-
Ajo property in which he is inter
ested, this property being located
near Dripping Springs, about 35
miles southwest of Ajo.

PLAN RECEPTION FOR
EX-GOVERNOR G. W. P. HUNT
Plans are being made for a public
reception for former governor G.
W. P. Hunt on his arrival in Phoenix
from Siam.
Former Governor Hunt was to
have landed in New York several
days ago, and is due in Phoenix
next Sunday or Monday, Feb. 5 or
6.

GASKILL AND BRIGGS HERE—
James P. Gaskill of Los Angeles
and Walter M. Briggs of Pleasanton,
Calif., were recent visitors to
the camp.
Mr. Gaskill was formerly general
manager of the Ajo Consolidated,
which was purchased by New
Cornelia. Mr. Briggs was president
of the Consolidated.

“Buy Something Made of Copper”

Arbor Day was observed ap
propriately in most of the
Ajo schools. From the state un
iversity, particulars have been
received relating to the State
league of high school debating
societies. The Curley High has
made application to join, and a
communication has been sent to
the principal of the Tucson High,
who has charge of this district,
asking to be given an opportunity
to compete in the next debate.
Mrs. Harney of the Clarkston
High School is ill and under treat
ment at the hospital.
The attendance is increasing.
Eight new pupils appeared Monday
morning for admittance. No
room is overcrowded, but almost
all are comfortably filled with
about the correct number a teacher
should have in a room.

PRICE FIVE CENTS

COL. GREENWAY HEAD OF
YALE ALUMNI OF STATE
(Arizona Republican)
Col. John C. Greenway of War
ren and Ajo, general manager of
the C. & A. and of New Cornelia,
was re-elected president of the
Yale Alumni association of Arizona
at a dinner meeting of the organi
zation at the Phoenix Country
club Monday evening. Eighteen
Yale alumni, representing several
portions of the State were
present.
Frank Cullen Brophy was re
elected secretary.

ARIZONA SCHOLARSHIP
Perhaps the most important fea
ture of the meeting was the initia
tion of a movement to establish an
Arizona scholarship at Yale,
whereby at least one Arizonian
may be kept at the famous univer
sity. A definite report upon the
plan will be submitted to the mem
bers of the association at the April
meeting.
All Yale men in Arizona, not
members of the association, are
asked to get in touch with the sec
retary, who will outline for them
the purposes of the organization
and assist them in becoming inte
gral parts of it.

EDITORIAL
The versatility of an editor is
shown by the fact that A. K. Par
ker, who formerly wrote such ele
gant Jeffersonian-brand editorials
for the Tucson Star, is now lamb
asting the Democrats as editor of
a dyed-in-the-wool Republican daily,
the Tucson Citizen.

With the mercury going down to
26 degrees twice in the month; and
with the minimum being 40 or
lower only nine times in 31 days,
January 1922 may be said to have
been a humdinger for a winter
month in Ajo. And to all appear
ances at this writing, February is
trying to follow in January’s foot
steps in more ways than one. And
Steele Bros. stand a good show to
sell that carload of stove wood—if
they ever get it. The S. P., they
say, has been ever since Monday
hauling this car from Casa Grande
to Gila Bend (63 miles): on Thurs
day the car had not yet arrived.

The Democrats could not do bet-
ter than nominate Colonel John C.
Greenway if they want to name
an all-round man who in the event
of his election would bring the
greatest possible prosperity to the
great State of Arizona.
