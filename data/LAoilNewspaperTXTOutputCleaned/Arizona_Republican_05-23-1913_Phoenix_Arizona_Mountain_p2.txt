TEMPE GETS
GLOBE DATE
And Maroons Will Play the
Colts in Tempe Sunday
Mesa Plays Giants Same
Day With Grand Opening
the Thirtieth

An unexpected opportunity to fill a
three-day playing engagement in Globe
and Miami was the cause of Frank
Hulin's turning over his date with
the Colts on Sunday to the Maroons,
and his hieing him to the tall hills
about the mining region. With the
consent of the league, Van Tyne en
tered negotiations with Manager
Frank Castle of the Maroons, and the
result is the Maroon-Colt game will
be pulled off in the south side town
Sunday afternoon.
The Tempe team leaves for Globe
this afternoon, taking autos via Roose
velt. The Saturday and Sunday dates
are with Globe, and on Monday the
team hooks up with Miami on the
return voyage. Whether the valley
team will be victorious or not remains
to be seen, for there is little dope to
go on. The last time the Tempeites
played in the mining country they
made a good showing against the
home teams. Having improved con
siderably, they are quite confident of
having a hand in the game.

News for the Ball Fans
MESA, May 21. Manager C. Frel
Brackett of the Mesa Athletics was
present at the managers' conference of
the Valley league Wednesday at Phoe
nix and reports that a permanent or
ganization was effected, and that a
big game will be played between the
Phoenix Giants and the Mesa Ath
letics at the Mesa park Sunday. This
is expected to be one of the hottest
battles of the season as Harry John
son of the Giants is firm in his be
lief that he has the strongest team
in the state, while Manager Brackett
is holding the same opinion of the
Mesa aggregation, and is laying plans
to give the Giants a taste of "Mis
souri hospitality" by "showing" them
that they are not in it.
The grand opening, or dedication, of
the Mesa ball park will take place on
Decoration day, when the Mesa
Broncho Busters will attempt to lasso
and put their brand on the Phoenix
Colts. The Mesa band will furnish
music between the innings, and a good
time is promised all who attend. A
part of the proceeds will go to help
the Mesa band boys.
These games are on the regular
schedule of the league, and the aver
ages will be counted on the official
schedule. It has been hinted that the
manager of the Colts has a $100 opin
ion that his team is a winner and
can make the Mesa team look like it
had been dropped by a cyclone, but
the Mesa team believes he will have
another think due him after the 30th.

Mighty Mundorff

drove out two home runs, each with
two runners on the paths ahead of

WORLD SHARES VALLEY'S
ORANGE MISFORTUNES
Care Given Damaged Orchards Here
Contrasted With Neglect of
Others
If the orange crop in the Salt
River valley is now in a uselessly
recuperative stage after a hard siege
of frost, the rest of the citrus world
is little better off in the matter of
supply for the market. The blighted
trees in the valley are not in such a
pitiable condition as some people
think. Some of the trees have been
killed outright, but others escaping
with their lives will grow stronger
than ever to produce another big
juicy crop next year. With new
grafting, the stems of the last year’s
crops will be in position to bear fine
fruit in another year or two.
In contrast with the care that is
bestowed on orange trees here after
the frost had rendered them almost
useless is the neglect of the Azore
islanders, whose orchards are decay
ing rapidly.
Since 1872 the crop of the islands
has fallen off until today practically
no oranges are exported. The rea
sons given are Spain’s competition,
disease and unscientific treatment of
the trees and fruit. Spain had, and
still has, a decided advantage over
St. Michael’s by facilities in shipping
the fruit by steamers direct, while
St. Michael’s was dependent upon
sailing vessels. Notwithstanding the
admitted superiority of St. Michael’s
fruit, Spain gained the market by
delivering fruit at stated periods and
in better condition.
Orange culture in the Azores at
present is in an unsatisfactory con
dition. The trees are neglected, and
fully half of the ripe fruit, it is esti
mated, is destroyed by rats. Wind
falls retail at approximately 10 cents
a hundred, and thousands of them
are left on the ground to rot. Today
the retail selling price of good fruit
varies from 5 to 20 cents per dozen.
