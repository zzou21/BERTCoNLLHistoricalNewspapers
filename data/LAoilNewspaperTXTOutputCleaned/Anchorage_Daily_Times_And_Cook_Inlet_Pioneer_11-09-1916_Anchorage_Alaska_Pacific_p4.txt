COMPLICATIONS
ARE PROBABLE

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Two complications are possible from the operations of a German submarine flotilla
on the United States coast—one with Germany over the blockade to
United States shipping that may result even though the operations of
the submarines are carried on outside the three-mile limit, and the other
with the allies because of the admission of German submarines to United
States ports.
It is observed here that the sinking of ships in proximity to the United
States coast has already shown its effect in precautionary orders given
shipping generally to remain in port.
The result, of course, it is pointed out, amounts to an interference with
neutral commerce. It has become apparent, too, that even though the operations of the submarines may be
carried on in strict accordance with the rules of war, the situation is
fraught with many possible complications involving the neutrality rights
of this country. It is recalled that at the outset of the war, when allied
cruisers hovered off the port of New York and so near the coast that commerce was impeded, the United States
in that instance considered their operations practically constituting a blockade. The government notified Great
Britain and France of the situation, and the ships were withdrawn further
out to sea.
With respect to the admission of submarines to ports of the United
States it is pointed out that in all probability the allies will hold this
government financially responsible for all damage done by submarines after they leave any port in the United
States. Although this probability was not stated in the notice to neutrals on
the subject sent out last week, there are precedents which will be urged in
support of claims of this character.
In some diplomatic circles the visit of the German submarine U-53 to
Newport and her later attacks on British ships, bringing actual submarine
warfare to the very shores of the United States, are taken to indicate that the events of the past two
days mark only the beginning of a definite campaign on the part of Germany to force the president to show
his hand.

AMERICAN INVENTS
ONE-MAN SUBMARINE
Through the invention of a new
type, one-man submarine, the first
full-sized and fully-equipped craft of
which was completed a few weeks ago,
Milton J. Trumble, president of a refining company, of Los Angeles, who
perfected an oil refining process that
brought him a fortune, expects to revolutionize warfare at sea to such an
extent that the power of the present
dreadnought will be greatly minimized.
While the strictest secrecy has been
maintained regarding the building of
the new underwater vessel, it was
learned that the craft recently was
launched at Naples and that, so far as
preliminary tests are concerned, it
comes up to all the hopes of its builder.
The principal feature of the craft is
that it is distinctly a one-man boat.
It is also constructed so that there is not
an inch of unnecessary space. The
operator of the craft easily may control every desired movement of the
submarine.
The craft, while capable of being
submerged by displacement, ordinarily
is submerged by means of a three-
blade propeller connected with its
keel.
In the event of an accident, crippling the motive power of the craft,
an automatic arrangement sends the
boat to the surface of the sea, thereby
giving its operator a chance to escape.
Always the vessel is submerged, except for its conning tower, the upper
portion of which is only twelve inches
above the surface of the water.
Equipped with an especially designed 110-horsepower motor the submarine, it is said, is capable of a speed
of thirty knots an hour.
