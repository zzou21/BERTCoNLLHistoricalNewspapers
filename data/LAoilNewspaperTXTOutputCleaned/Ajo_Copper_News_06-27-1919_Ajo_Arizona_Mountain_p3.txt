Ajo Scores Over Los Angeles
Mrs. Martt Browne left Saturday
on the 5:45 gas car for Los Angeles,
where she will spend two or three
months. Though going ostensibly to
escape the heat, in reality Mrs.
Browne goes principally on business,
it being her intention to sell her
Los Angeles property and invest the
proceeds in this camp, purchasing
a lot and erecting a fine apartment
house for rent. She thinks Ajo is
the coming city.
We can fill your order for ANY
THING in the printing line.
B. Burstein left Saturday for Los
Angeles to visit his family and to
transact business.
