THE MINES OF ARIZONA

This department is under the di-
rection of Mr. W. E. Defty, the
well known mining engineer, who
will carefully scrutinize all mat-
ters relating to mining in order
that only reliable information re-
garding legitimate enterprises
shall find a place here.
The Republican would be pleased
to receive information from
any part of the state regarding
the development of the mining in-
dustry. All communications
should be addressed: Mining De-
partment, Arizona Republican.

Still Developing
Capt. John C. Greenway, general
manager of the Calumet and Arizona
Mining Company, has returned from
an inspection of the company’s prop-
erties in Pinal county. He states
that the company has spent about
$300,000 in the development of these
properties, which are in the Superior
district. He said present indications
are rather discouraging, though the
property has not been abandoned
and there is some hope that better
results will yet be obtained.

CALUMET & ARIZONA

Developments at New Cornelia En-
countering of Water An Import-
ant Matter

According to latest advices from
the southwest, developments of far-
reaching importance have been tak-
ing place at the Calumet & Arizona's
steam-shovel property at Ajo, in
connection with the water problem
which indicate that the situation has
apparently been solved.

The question of water at Ajo for
the reduction of the ore has been
one which has given the Calumet
& Arizona officials some little con-
cern, although as a last resort if in-
sufficient water were developed at
the property, the management knew
it would always be possible to pump
water from a distance of forty miles.

About a year ago a well was driven
which encountered a good flow of
water, but not sufficient for all re-
quirements. Recently a drilling cam-
paign was started, but it was not un-
til a few weeks ago when a hole was
put down at a considerable distance
from those heretofore drilled and in
an entirely new area, that any large
quantity of water was encountered.
This well which was sunk to a depth
of 700 feet has been flowing continu-
ously at the rate of 200 gallons per
minute. The management is putting
down other wells to further develop
this section and there is little doubt
but that ample water for any size
plant determined upon will be en-
countered. It is estimated that about
500 gallons per minute will be re-
quired to supply the plant now under
consideration and all other needs.

The New Cornelia management is
greatly pleased with the way the wa-
ter situation is working out, for it
will result in an immense saving to
the company, as the other source of
water mentioned above, i. e., from
the Gila River 40 miles distant,
would have to be pumped against a
head, as Ajo is at a greater eleva-
tion.

The Calumet & Arizona manage-
ment is now giving their attention
to the method of treating the 40,-
000,000 tons of ore which have thus
far been developed at Ajo. The car-
bonate ores will be leached, but it
has not yet been decided whether or
not the copper will be precipitated
from solution by iron or by another
method. The sulphide ores of which
there are 28,000,000 tons, have been
found to yield a splendid recovery by
the flotation process, and if this
method is selected a very high saving
can be expected. It is stated that
several months more will be neces-
sary for determining the final method
to be used and that any definite re-
sults should not be expected until
fall. (From News Letter.)

This company has also started a
new electric hauling line to connect
from the Briggs motor line to the
Hoatson shaft at Bisbee.
