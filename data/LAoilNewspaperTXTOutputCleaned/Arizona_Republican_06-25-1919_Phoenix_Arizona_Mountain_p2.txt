of the work which America is doing
for the world. I am proud of the
power of my country and of the manner in which that power has been used;
and I am proud of the leadership of
President Wilson.
Only a year ago, General Haig, with
the bluntness of a soldier, said "The
British army is fighting with its back
against the wall." Less than a year
ago, Lloyd George said, "It is a race
between Wilson and Hindenburg," and
at that very moment France was
clinging like a drowning man to the
Rock of Verdun, and turning agonizing
eyes toward America. And America
arrived. The war was won and I chal
lenge the critics of the administration
to suggest how, within the bounds of
ordinary human possibility, we could have won
the war more promptly or with less

loss of American life? The Republican
party is rendering small service to
America when it converts the machinery
of its organization into an instrument

of attack upon American leadership
and American honor.

Chairman of National Committee

with Local Party Leaders
At Stadium in Evening

Chairman Cummings accompanied
by J. Bruce Kremer of Montana, vice
chairman of the Democratic national
committee; Mrs. George Bass of Illinois,
chairman of the associate woman's
Democratic national committee; W. R.
Hollister, executive secretary; W. J.
Cochran, director of publicity, and
Charles F. Maguire, private secretary
to the chairman arrived in the city yes
terday morning.
Mr. Cochran is the Washington cor
respondent for the St. Louis Republic.
He met here an old acquaintance, P. H.
(Pat) Madden of the office of the coun
ty attorney. Not a large but a fairly
representative delegation of the Demo
cratic leaders of the state greeted the
party here and in the afternoon met

The gentlemen who are now leading
the Republican party, criticizing the
president of the United States and
warning the people against the policies
of Wilson and the league of nations,
are the bad advisers of old, the dis
credited leaders, the men whose coun
sel led to trouble, and whose advice
had to be discarded before America
could make progress. Is this too gen
eral an assertion? Let me be a little
more particular. Was it not Senator
Lodge who proclaimed in the Senate
that the Federal Reserve system was
foredoomed to failure? Was it not
Senator Root who said that the Fed
eral Reserve system would ruin the
financial structure of America? Was

Tomatoes, cantaloupes and cucum
bers are very plentiful; the cantaloupes
especially are now arriving in quan
tities. Green chili and bell peppers are be
coming more plentiful with each day.
They are large and of good quality.
Watermelons continue to maintain a
good price and will do so until after
July 4.

the chairman and his party in a love
feast. Republicans and eavesdroppers
were excluded, but it was stated guardedly that the matter largely under dis
cussion was harmony which has been
the chief theme of Mr. Cummings in
his journey across the country. He
probably found the greatest need of it
here of any place he had visited.
It was felt that something should
be done to close the disastrous rift
which began to manifest itself four
years ago and which brought defeat to
the party in 1916 and more decisively
last year.
County Chairman Resigned
The feature of the meeting yesterday
was a speech by Vice Chairman Kremer
who spoke of the republican charge of
extravagance of expenditures during
the war which he reviewed from the
entrance of the country into the war
and the preparation made by the last
congress for the work of reconstruction.
The proceedings at the meeting were
generally informal, consisting of dis
cussions of the local situation and of
plans for getting together. It was de
veloped that the resignation of State
Chairman George Babbitt had for some
time been in the hands of the state
committee. No action was taken on it
yesterday and there was an expression
against action before the meeting next
fall. Names of several men have been
suggested for the chairmanship, the
more prominent being those of W. L.
Barnum and C. W. Miller of Tempe.
It is the prevailing belief that if the
resignation is accepted Judge Barnum
will be chosen.

It was reported that the resignation
of Chairman Babbitt has a string at
tached to it; rather, that it is made with
the intention of forcing its acceptance
unless several of the candidates of the
campaign last fall redeem their finan
cial pledges. It is understood that there
are now outstanding unredeemed
pledges amounting to about $1,500.
Not Many at Stadium
The proceedings yesterday were pre
liminary to another meeting of the com
mittee today when some decisive action
may be taken.
Mrs. Bass of the party met with sev
eral democratic women, and a prelimi
nary associate committee was formed,
probably to be completed today. This
work is understood to be in the hands of
Miss Alice Birdsall.
The concluding event of the day was
the speech of Chairman Cummings at
the Y. M. C. A. stadium last night.
There was not as large an attendance
as the first visit of a national chair
man to Phoenix should have evoked
and the enthusiasm was somewhat re
strained. The latter phenomenon, how
ever, may be associated with the state
of Salt River valley thermometers.
Judge Barnum introduced the chair
man who first called attention to the
fact that the people of Arizona were
looking upon something that had never
happened before, the presence of a na
tional chairman of either party. None
of either, during a national campaign
or prior to it had ever crossed the
Missouri. Mr. Cummings said, though,
that a new condition had arisen, the
world was being made over. It was no
sectional struggle that was now taking
place; it was more than a national af
fair. The contest was international in
character and if it should end in the
overthrow of the Democratic party it
would be the worse for humanity.
It was gathered from the remarks of
the chairman that the Democratic party
was Woodrow Wilson.
He said further:
Chairman Cummings Address
Apparently we have reached a period
in our political history when the party
out of power has become so desperate
in its attempts to secure political con
trol that a concerted effort is being
made by Republican leaders to under
mine the influence of the president of
the United States. Unmindful of the
mighty issues at stake, disregarding
all of the limitations which ordinarily
control political discussion and indif
ferent to the peace of the world, these
leaders pursue a policy which amounts
to a political conspiracy. Much can
be given to the zeal of partisanship
but what place in history will be allot
ted to men who, forgetful of America's
honor, have united in a deliberate at
tempt to destroy the influence of
America's delegates as they sit at the
peace council of the world. The "round
robin" and the pending Knox resolu
tion are part and parcel of a delib
erate purpose to disrupt the peace con
ference and to throw it into confusion,
rendering its deliberations abortive and
leaving the world to chaos. This is the
price which partisanship is prepared to
pay in order that President Wilson
may be discredited as a world leader
and the reactionary elements restored
to power.
As I read the reports of their
speeches of strict and unrelenting par
tisanship, I wonder what phrases of
abuse, what language of vituperation,
what invective, what recital of blun
ders and crimes would have agitated
the political atmosphere if the presi
dent of the United States had led the
country to the disastrous conclusion of
an unsuccessful war. Every epithet
of reproach has already been exhausted
in an attempt to discredit the leader
ship of America's president at a time
when America's prestige was never
greater, America's power never so vast
and America's success never so trans
cendent. The campaign of slander,
which is the very spume of politics,
has been reserved for America's great
est leader in the hour of America's
greatest triumph. To listen to the
spokesmen of the Republican organiza
tion is to gather the impression that
America lost her war, and has been
forced into a discreditable peace, humi
liating to all lovers of constitutional
government and freedom. I do not
know how others may feel about it,
but as for myself, I am proud to be
an American citizen. I am proud of
the army. I am proud of our great
navy. I am proud of the heroism of
American men and women. I am proud
of the role that America has played
in the affairs of the world. I am proud

gentlemen oppose the passage of the
shipping bill which was urged by Sec
retary McAdoo two years before the
war began? Was it not this same
group of leaders who are responsible
for the opposition to the income tax,
the farm loan system and the agricul
tural and labor bills? These are the
same bad advisers, who, hopeful that
America has forgotten their bad advice,
are now tendering their suggestions as
to the future.
The Republican organization has re
verted to type. Its leaders seek to re
store the "good old days of Mark
Hanna." Unable to agree upon any
constructive program of their own, they
unite in unfaltering opposition to any
thing and everything that is proposed
by President Wilson. The threatened
revolt of the seven progressive Repub
lican senators has been suppressed.
The choice committee assignments go
to Penrose, Lodge, Warren and Smoot,
while the unhappy reformers are re
citted with places upon minor commit
tees. The insurrection has collapsed.
The dying spasms of Republican liber
alism have ceased and the reactionaries
are in full control of the Senate and
the House. Will the liberal spirit of
the people of Arizona permit them to
follow a leadership so hopelessly Bour
bon, so pitifully inadequate, so com
pletely reactionary? Will the spirit of
fairness of the people of this state per
mit them to take part in a campaign
of slander which the reactionary lead
ers of the Republican organization are
waging against our president?

So vindictive have become their at
tacks upon the president, so outrageous
have become their assaults, that one
would imagine that President Wilson
was an arch criminal being brought
before the bar of world justice. And
yet, what has he done, save to lead the
country successfully through the great
est war of all times, and following that,
to devote his great talents to creating
a structure of world peace which shall
make the recurrence of war unlikely,
if not impossible. The president has
endeavored to realize for humanity the
dearest dream that has come to the
mind of man since the dawn of civiliza
tion. For the first time in the turbulent
annals of the human race, an agree
ment has been adopted, calculated to
include ultimately all the nations of the
world and to arrange international af
fairs, not in accordance with the out
grown doctrines of another age, but in
harmony with the principles of human
justice applicable equally to the great
and to the small. That an American
president is engaged in this work
should move every American heart,
irrespective of party affiliation or per
sonal prejudice, to a fervent prayer
that he may succeed in his great task.
Despite all obstacles and discourage
ments, he has persisted. Within a few
days he will return to America, bear
ing with him the greatest document of
human liberty ever prepared by the
hands of man. It is not conceivable
that the malice of a few will be per
mitted to deny to America and to the
world this measure of healing.
Vice Chairman Kremer. Mr. Cochran
and Mrs. Bass left for the coast yes
terday afternoon. Mr. Cummings will
take his departure this morning.

ELEVEN COWS DIE

Eleven cows died suddenly and un
der mysterious circumstances yester
day at the ranch of C. E. Cartwright,
six and one half miles northeast of
Phoenix.
Forty beef cattle were turned from
stubble into an alfalfa field at 9:30 in
the morning, and two hours later 13
of them were found lying within a
space less than a city lot. 11 of them
dead and the other three very sick.
These were lying close together in the
middle of the field, and not another
in the herd seemed to be affected.
Dr. R. J. Hight, state veterinarian,
and Dr. H. O. Ramsey were called, and
pronounced them poisoned and were
able to save the three that were still
alive. The stomachs and contents will
be analyzed in an effort to determine
the nature of the poison.
It was thought that it might have
been arsenic poisoning from the
spraying of the fields to kill grass
hoppers but this field has never been
sprayed, which adds to the mystery of
the case.

ERNIE, B. C, June 24. Most of the
residents of Natal, B. C. were taken
from the town in a special train of
boxcars Sunday, when threatening for
est fires appeared about to sweep the
place, according to reports received to
day. A volunteer fire crew which re
mained in the town extinguished the
blaze after the fire in the immediate
vicinity had spent itself. The residents
of Natal spent all day Sunday fighting
the fires.

PRESIDENT-ELECT IS
FETED BEFORE GOING

WASHINGTON, June 24. Development
of close commercial relations between
Brazil and other countries, the United
States in particular, was declared today
by Dr. Epitacio Pessoa, president-elect
of Brazil, to be one of the aims of his
coming administration. In his last pub
lic address in Washington, made at a
luncheon given in his honor by Secretary
Redfield, Dr. Pessoa said the United
States held two undeniable titles to
Brazilian friendship. This country, he
said, always has been a trade friend of
Brazil, and also in the United States the
Brazilian people see the means through
which their commerce may be further
developed. The festivities in honor of President
elect Pessoa ended tonight with a re
ception at the Pan-American union,
given by acting Secretary of State
and Mrs. Polk. Dr. Pessoa and his
party will leave Washington tomorrow
for New York, and later will visit
Ottawa and Boston before sailing for
Brazil, July 6, on the United States
dreadnought Idaho.

"BIG FOUR" PAY VISIT
TO HALL OF MIRRORS

VERSAILLES, June 24. Premier
Clemenceau, President Wilson and Pre
mier Lloyd George visited the palace

this afternoon to inspect the arrange
ments for the ceremony of signing the
peace treaty.

M. Clemenceau and Paul Dutasta,
general secretary of the peace con
ference, drove to the chateau at 2

o'clock. Arthur J. Balfour, the British

foreign secretary, came 25 minutes
later, being followed shortly afterward
by President Wilson and Baron Son

The party visited the Hall of Mirrors,
where the treaty is to be signed.
Later they visited the apartment of
Louis XIV, congress hall, and the sen
ate room in the palace and left at 3:40
o'clock for the return trip to Paris.

FRIDAY, THE 27TH,
PENCE WILL COME

PARIS, June 24. (By the Associated
Press) Friday has been set for the
day for signing the peace treaty.
While the German plenipotentiaries
have not yet been announced, advices
received from Weimar are to the effect
that they will arrive in Versailles Fri
day morning.
M. Clemenceau will open the cere
monies with a brief introduction. No
speech is expected from the Germans.
William Martin of the French foreign
office, as master of ceremonies, will
then carry the treaty to President Wil
son and the premiers, who will sign at
their seats.
After the treaty is brought back to
the signature table, the names of the
other delegates will be called and they
will advance and sign.
It is expected that the signing will
require two hours. The seals of all
the delegates will be arrived in ad
vance; many of them are already in
the hands of the French foreign office.
President Wilson is using the presi
dent's seal, which is official, with the
words "Seal of the President of the
United States."
Some of the seals supplied by the
delegates are merely monograms un
adorned. The French treaty experts regard
the Chinese and Japanese seals as the
most artistic. These are chiefly the
names of the delegates in Oriental let
ters, and are adorned with flowers
and quaint figures.
The expectation was that strictly
personal seals would be used, but like
President Wilson, M. Vandervelde, rep
resenting Belgium, is using an official
seal the Belgian coat of arms en
circled by the words "minister of Jus
tice." The German delegates will sign after
the allies.
The order in which the delegates will
sign, after the signatures of the presi
dent and premiers are attached, will be
according to the alphabetical names of
the countries they represent. When
the signatures are completed, the en
tire party will emerge on the terrace
at the side of the palace, where all the
great fountains will be playing in the
gardens. The Germans will leave on
the side where they entered.
DAY PASSES WITHOUT
MENTION OF LEAGUE

Wednesday and Thursday

WASHINGTON, June 24. There was
a temporary lull today in the league
of nations debate, which has been al
most continuous since the new senate
convened. It was the first time in more
than a month that an entire day's ses
sion passed without a mention of the
peace treaty.
The senate did not take up the
amendment presented by Senator Fall,
Republican of New Mexico, and favored
by many league opponents, to declare
the war at an end.
When the amendment finally is
reached, the prospect is that it will
be ruled out of order after it has fur
nished the vehicle for a debate on its
propriety. In the event it is thus re
jected, Senator Fall is expected to try
later for legislation on a joint resolu
tion offered, embodying a similar peace
declaration.
There were indications tonight that
the foreign relations committee may
not take up the measure, as had been
expected, tomorrow.
