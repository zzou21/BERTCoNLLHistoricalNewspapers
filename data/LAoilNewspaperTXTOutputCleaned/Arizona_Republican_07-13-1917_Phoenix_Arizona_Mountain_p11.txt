ANNOUNCEMENT
Beginning Thursday, June 21, our
store at the corner of First Avenue and
Adams Street will be open till 9 p. m.
We will continue this through the hot
months. In connection we wish to
state that the salespeople in our em
ploy are not being worked overtime.
We believe that six o’clock closing
during the hot months shuts off the
coolest hours for shopping, so have
added extra salespeople for this pur
pose. No goods will be delivered after
six o’clock. All orders after six will go
out the following morning.

ANNOUNCEMENT
Effective July 15th, a charge of
fifteen cents for three minutes and
five cents for each additional minute
of conversation will be made for all
messages transmitted over the lines
of this company between the Glen
dale telephone exchange and the
Phoenix telephone exchange.

This charge is warranted, not only
to prevent high operating costs and
waste of facilities through the use of
these lines for other than necessary
conversations, but to provide that
the subscribers whose excessive use
of lines call for unwarranted facil
ities and increased operating costs,
shall pay for service rendered, as
well as to do away with the discrimi
natory feature of free service be
tween the towns of Phoenix and
Glendale, the expense of which is
being borne, not by the subscribers
of Phoenix and Glendale, but by the
subscribers of the state as a whole.

Again, this charge for toll service
will act as an insurance against the
burdening of the Phoenix-Glendale
lines with calls of unnecessary char
acter; against bad operating condi
tions, and the installation of unus
ual and costly facilities for the use
of a few and at the expense and dis
advantage of the general public and
the operating company.

The present “No charge” condition
results in the monopolization of
the lines and abuse of the service by
those whose conversations are of no
importance other than social, while
the charging of toll will tend to pre
vent the use of the lines by such
parties to the exclusion of others,
and make the lines more useful to
the general public by preventing con
gestion which would inordinately de
lay emergency use; and to make the
entire service more available to the
public.

The present “No charge” condition
is discriminatory and cannot lawfully
be further countenanced by either
the state regulating body or by this
company.

The new arrangement will work to
the advantage of the business men of
this community, who will profit by
prompt and efficient service between
these points.
