ROOSEVELT

AT OXFORD
His
Lecture On
Analogies In History
COLONEL IS NOW A D. C. L.
It Was Predicted That He
Would Not Long Remain
a Private Citizen Ox
ford Had Witnessed No
Similar Scene Recently.
Oxford, June 7. Oxford today con
ferred upon Theodore Roosevelt the
honorary degree of doctor of civil law.
The ceremony took place in the Shel
donian theater where for three cen
turies and more it has been the custom
to hold the exercises, the annual com
memoration of the founders, and other
official assemblies, but Mr. Roosevelt's
reception surpassed in enthusiasm
anything within the memory of the
oldest Oxonian.
His "Romanes" lecture which dealt
with biological analogies in history
proved to be a powerful exposition of
"all the strange analogies" as the lec
turer himself expressed it.
Toward the close Mr. Roosevelt's
voice failed and he was obliged to
leave undelivered a portion of his pre
pared lecture. But before he with
drew from the platform he had won
the great audience in the theater by his
vigorous utterances and forceful ges
tures, being cheered repeatedly.
Even the usually solemn red-robed
dons were carried away and stood up
and joined in the outburst of hurrahs
of the younger element.
Lord Curzon, of Kedleston, chan
cellor of Oxford, in introducing the
new created doctor of civil law, who
appeared for the first time in the red
robes of the doctorate, spoke of Mr.
Roosevelt as "a ruler of men, the
most conspicuous figure in America
since Abraham Lincoln."
After touching on the former presi
dent's many achievements, the chan
cellor said: "Although he is now tak
ing a holiday, it is undreamable that
such a man will long remain out of
public life."
Colonel Roosevelt said:
"Rome fell by attack from without
only because the ills within her own
borders had grown incurable. What
is true of your country, my hearers, is
true of my own; while we should be
vigilant against foes from without, yet
we need never really fear them so long
as we safeguard ourselves against the
enemies within our own households;
and these enemies are our own pas
sions and follies. Free peoples can
escape being mastered by others only
by being able to master themselves.
We Americans, and you people of the
British Isles alike, need ever to keep
in mind that, among the many qualities
indispensable to the success of a
great democracy, and second only to a
high and stern sense of duty, of moral
obligation, are self-knowledge and self
mastery. You, my hosts, and I may
not agree in all our views; some of
you would think me a very radical
democrat—as, for the matter of that, I
am; and my story of imperialism
would probably suit the anti-imperialists
as little as it would suit a certain
type of forcible-feeble imperialist.
But there are some points on which
we must all agree if we think soundly.
The precise form of government, dem
ocratic or otherwise, is the instrument,
the tool, with which we work. It is
important to have a good tool. But,
even if it is the best possible, it is only
a tool. No implement can ever take
the place of the guiding intelligence
that wields it. A very bad tool will
ruin the work of the best craftsman;
but a good tool in bad hands is no
better. In the last analysis the all
important factor in national greatness
is national character.

WHAT OF THE FUTURE.
"There are questions that we of the
great civilized nations are ever tempt
ed to ask of the future. Is our time
of growth drawing to an end? Are
we as nations soon to come under the
rule of that great law of death which
is itself but part of the great law of
life? None can tell. Forces that we
can see and other forces that are hid
den or that can but dimly be appre
hended are at work all around us, both
for good and for evil. The growth in
luxury, in love of ease, in taste for
vapid and frivolous excitement, is both
evident and unhealthy. The most omin
ous sign is the diminution in the birth
rate, and the rate of natural increase,
now to a larger or lesser degree
shared by most of the civilized nations
of central and western Europe, of
America and Australia; a diminution so
great that if it continues for the next
century at the rate which has obtained
for the last twenty-five years, all the
more highly civilized peoples will be
stationary or else have begun to go
backward in population, while many of
them will have already gone very far
backward.
"There is much that should give us
concern for the future. But there is
much also which should give us hope.
No man is more apt to be mistaken
than the prophet of evil.

GROUNDLESS FEARS.
After the French revolution in 1830,
Niebuhr hazarded the guess that all
civilization was about to go down with
a crash, that we were all about to
share the fall of third and fourth cen
tury Rome, a respectable but painful
ly overworked comparison. The fears
once expressed by the followers of
Malthus as to the future of the world
have proved groundless as regards the
civilized portion of the world; it is
strange indeed to look back at Car
lyle's prophecies of some seventy years
ago, and then think of the teeming
life of achievement, the life of conquest
of every kind, and of noble effort
crowned by success, which has been
ours for the two generations since he
complained to high Heaven that all
the tales had been told and all the
songs sung, and that all the deeds real
ly worth doing had been done. I be
lieve with all my heart that a great
future remains for us; but whether it
does or does not, our duty is not al
tered. However the battle may go, the
soldier worthy of the name will with
utmost vigor do his allotted task, and
bear himself as valiantly in defeat as
in victory. Come what will, we belong
to peoples who have not yielded to the
craven fear of being great. In the ages
that have gone by, the great nations,
the nations that have expanded and
that have played a mighty part in the
world, have in the end grown old and
weakened and vanished; but so have
the nations whose only thought was to
avoid all danger, all effort, who would
risk nothing, and who therefore gained
nothing. In the end the same fate
may overwhelm all alike; but the
memory of one type perishes with it,
while the other leaves its mark deep
