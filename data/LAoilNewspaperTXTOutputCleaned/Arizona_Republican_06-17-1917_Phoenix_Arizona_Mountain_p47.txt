ROADSTER

Avery Corpstein, oldest son of Mayor
Peter Corpstein, of the city of Phoenix,
is driving a Haynes light six, four
passenger roadster, delivered to him
during the past week by the Borderland
Motor company. One suit of clothes
was ruined, a new silk shirt was put
"on the bum'' and several quarts of
oil and grease were absorbed in the
suit and shirt before Corpstein finally
had decided that the Haynes was the
car he wished to own and drive. He
investigated the motor car field thor
oughly before he began eliminations.
At the end of his examinations he de
clared for the Haynes and since he has
been driving his light six roadster.
The advice of an engineer, a friend of
Corpstein's, had much to do with his
final selection of the Haynes as the
"one best bet." According to the en
gineer, who, by the way, was a me
chanical expert, there is no greater
value in the world in motor cars than
is found in the Haynes at the price.
Mechanically, declared this engineer to
Corpstein, the car is excellent. Its
features are such as would recommend
it, he declared, to the most critical
of buyers and to the most experienced
motor car owner.
Corpstein investigated these state
ments himself to verify them. In the
service rooms of the Borderland Motor
company he examined critically every
Haynes on the floor. With a perfectly
good suit of clothes and a silk shirt as
his jumper and bib he crawled beneath,
over and into the cars. He probed
their joints, their bolts, their construc
tion, their engines, their springs, their
lighting, starting and ignition systems,
their wiring, with experienced eye.
Finally Corpstein satisfied himself
as to the qualities of the car. He drove
one about the streets of Phoenix and
into the hills about the city. Then he
returned to the Borderland Motor com
pany's offices and announced that he
was satisfied.
Corpstein is an example of Haynes
purchasers throughout the entire nation.
Men and women who know what
they are buying when they buy it and
men and women who are thoroughly
conversant with motor car qualities
are universally Haynes drivers and
owners. Those who are mechanically
acquainted with motor vehicles realize
the Haynes superiorities and recog
nize the Haynes as among the best
cars in the world. It is for this rea
son alone that Haynes owners are
never dissatisfied with their cars and
that Haynes owners, after two or three
years of Haynes pleasure, universally
buy a Haynes when they make their
second, third or fourth purchase.

Long Island Farmers' Wives In
structed by Wealthy Women
Dressed in nobby sport suits and
wearing platinum wrist watches, sev
eral of New York's ultra-society wom
en are touring Long Island to teach
farmers' wives how to can and pre
serve their surplus foodstuff. They are
the Pauline Reveres of the Long Island
Food Reserve Battalion, seeking
to arouse the rural population to the
perils of food shortage and the need
of conserving for next winter all the
food in excess of what is actually
needed during the summer.
Clams, eclairs, real turtle soup and
similar dishes which soothe the pal
ates of the wealthy have been aban
doned by these rich women for rhubarb. That is, they are not eating the
rhubarb, but they are lecturing on
rhubarb. They show visitors just how
to make cans, in which the rhubarb
has been placed, airtight. Cannery ex
perts from the Long Island Experi
ment Station do the talking, and at
the proper moment the lecturers di
rect the attention of the audience to
the airtight experts.
Train of Freight Cars
Freight cars make up the canning
special. The women give the rhubarb
lecture in the freight cars. To the
rear of the train is attached the pri
vate car of Ralph Peters, president of
the Long Island Railroad. The women
ride in that. Over the doors of the
freight cars, in blazing red letters, are
these words:
Preserve or perish! Can or collapse!
In these freight cars, when the train
stops at a country station, are the fol
lowing from New York's select: Mrs.
William K. Vanderbilt, Jr., Mrs. Ar
thur Scott Burden, Mrs. William
Laimbeer, Mrs. Watson Webb and
Mrs. Ralph Peters. Also, from the ex
periment station are Mr. and Mrs. H.
B. Fullerton and Mrs. A. Louise An
drea.
The first lecture was at Nassau.
Pink silk sweaters and the fancy gar
den frocks of the fashionable North
Shore residents mingled with the
Sunday best, black serge and white
shirtwaists of the town. Cooks and
housekeepers came in motor cars to
greet the special. Others came down
the sandy country roads pushing baby
buggies to hear the lectures and set
the demonstrations.
However, it was in Hicksville that
Mrs. Vanderbilt got in the best work
of the day. While mothers attended
the lectures she took care of fretful
babies. It all began when movie men
tried to get a picture of Mrs. Vander
bilt as she strolled on the station
platform, waiting for the lecture to
begin. One of the movie men wheeled
a baby carriage out of the way and
turned the baby's face toward the
sun.
"Man! Don't you know better than
that?" Mrs. Vanderbilt exclaimed impatiently. "The poor lamb can't have
sun in his eyes."
Mrs. Vanderbilt frowned on the movie man and kept a protecting arm in
front of the baby's face while the pic
ture was being taken. The baby's
mother leaned out of a car door, awed,
as she saw her son pulling at a plat
inum bracelet on Mrs. Vanderbilt's
wrist.
The wealthy New York woman soon
was the center of a ring of babies. The
infants, evidently charmed by her
pale yellow sport suit and big black
hat, cooed and gurgled, while their
mothers could give wholehearted at
tention to the demonstrations inside
the cars.
Food for the Needy

"Why not?" Mrs. Vanderbilt laughed
when asked about the nursery. "I
know a lot more about babies than I
do about canning. I've got three of
my own."
Mrs. Vanderbilt sympathized with
the mother of five children over the
high cost of living. She inquired of
another what she fed her baby and
expressed approval when the mother
answered "cow's milk."
It was decided to establish a cen
tral canning station in Hicksville and
furnish motor car service to gather
fruit and vegetables from those who
will have them to spare. This food
will then be preserved and distributed
to the needy.
The special ran into no opposition on the first day of the trip until it
reached the last stop. There a Ger
man band serenaded the canners so
long it had to be asked to stop. There
was a momentary silence and then a
low-voiced command:
"Herman says to play 'The Star
Spangled Banner.' They can't stop us
in the middle of that."
The band played on.

Buy a proved car. A car like the Chevrolet. Your investment lasts.
Motor, transmission and clutch are equally good. All combined with the rear
axle make a perfect mechanical unit and insure satisfaction in day-after-day
use.
This high quality touring car sells for $650 here.

HEARTWELL MOTOR COMPANY
Los Angeles, Dec. 22, 1916.
Los Angeles Trailer Company,
Los Angeles, California.
Gentlemen:
Trailers are considered by most people to be a mere frame with
springs mounted on a couple of axles on two or four wheels. Many
people have spent considerable money to learn that this is not
the case.
While we have always considered it economy to have nothing
but first-class constructed trailers to operate with Jeffery Quad
trucks, which is usually under conditions that a two-wheel drive
truck cannot operate, we wish to tell you frankly that the trailer
built by yourselves is one of the very few trailers that we would
wish to call successful in the way of keeping in the tracks of the
truck, and not wobbling all over the road.
After having tried out several makes of trailers, and also having
purchased several from you, we wish to advise that we are getting
better results with your trailers than with any others we have used
or experimented with.
Yours very truly,
HEARTWELL MOTOR COMPANY,
J. L. Olsen, Mgr. Truck Dept.

Gentlemen:
Replying to your favor of Dec. 15th, would
state that we have had very satisfactory results
from the trailers which we have purchased
from you.
We find these trailers a very valuable asset
to us in our delivery business, as they come in
very handy, particularly in country districts.
By using them in conjunction with our Ford
cars, we are enabled to take care of our emer
gency deliveries. We have now over thirty in
operation and are very pleased with the results.
Yours truly,

Gentlemen:
We are mailing you under separate cover a
photograph of your trailers used by Banks
Bros. for the hauling of the Cardiff ore. We
wish to state that Banks Bros. are entirely sat
isfied with these trailers and would have no
other trailer.
In this picture Banks Bros. are shown, one
standing at the front of the truck and the other
one leaning against the rear end of the trailer.
Believing that this photograph shows your
trailers up to a good advantage and saying our
customers and ourselves are satisfied in every
way with your trailers, you may use us as
references.
Yours truly,

EL PASO SASH & DOOR COMPANY
Wholesale
El Paso, Texas, Nov. 20, 1916.
Mr. W. F. Tayne,
City.
Dear Sir:
We understand that you are interested in in
formation regarding trailers for use with motor
trucks.
We have been using a two-wheel trailer,
which we secured from the Los Angeles Trailer
Company some eight or nine months ago.
We use this both with our two-ton truck and
with our Ford truck and get excellent satisfac
tion from either.
We find that the use of this trailer gives us
almost as much delivery capacity as an addi
tional truck.
Our trailer has been in use continuously
since we have had it, and apparently is in as
good condition as when we first got it.
We believe that the trailer idea with motor
trucks represents about the most economical
delivery system yet tried.
Yours truly,
(Signed) EL PASO SASH & DOOR CO.,

Replying to yours of the 18th inst.
We have been using one of your trailers be
hind a Ford roadster for eighteen months at our

Gentlemen:
A year ago we ordered from you our first
two-wheel trailer for use behind a Ford. Since
then we have received three other two-wheel
models and are now beginning to operate the
four-wheel model recently shipped us, behind a
two-ton truck.
For your information, the two-wheel models
have given us excellent service with light cars,
and we anticipate equally good results with
the heavier model.
Very truly yours,

Gentlemen:
We are pleased to say that we have been
using two of your one-ton, two-wheeled trailers

plant can be immediately increased, so effi
ciently and economically.
We have been satisfied in every respect.
Yours very truly,
