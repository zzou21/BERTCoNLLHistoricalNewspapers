GRADUATING CLASS
PRINTS ITS ANNUAL
A Neat Publication That Is a Credit
to the Class of 1912.
The graduating class of 1912 of the
Tempe Normal school day before yes
terday placed their annual entitled
“The Fountain,” on the market. Some
two hundred copies were also deliv
ered, the orders for them having
been taken a short time before the
close of school last year. R. J. Peck,
business manager of the class, as
sisted by a few members of the class
from town, worked several days ad
dressing and delivering the annuals
but everything was finished up last
Wednesday evening, probably the
last thing the class will ever accom
plish together.
The publication is named after the
lily fountain installed in front of the
main building last year and bears a
small picture on the front page in
resemblance of it. On the following
pages is a large cut, of the Normal
building proper and the table of con
tents. The volume is dedicated “To
that last and brightest star, whose
appearance in the west has been
gladly hailed by the Wise Men of the
East.” Pictures of class officers, the
faculty and the class members are
next in line. Accomplishments of the
class compose the reading matter to
a large degree. Athletics, societies,
jokes, and class organizations of the
school are found in the copy too,
however.
There is little doubt but what this
is the last view of the work of the
class as a whole one will ever see
again. The publication shows the ef
forts of practically every member of
the class, either in the working up
of the book or other labor in behalf
of the class as a whole. The senior
circus and play comes in for its
share of the space in the annual,
every member of the class having
something to do with the former.
It was that affair that cleared them
from debt and left them with money
in the treasury at the present date.
Taking the volume in its entirety it
appears that the complete class of
1912 should be highly recommended
for leaving such a work of art as
“The Fountain” as a last remem
brance of its efforts in the Tempe
Normal school.

HOME AGAIN
J. H. Williams and wife and
daughter, Miss Winona Barber, re
turned yesterday morning from Re
dondo Beach, California, where they
have been located since leaving Tem
pe about the first of July. Mr. Wil
liams has recently tendered his res
ignation as manager of the dining
room at the Normal school and will
move to Phoenix. He has concluded
to open a sanitarium at that place
and expects to go to work at once
upon the construction of a number
of small cottages. No one has been
announced as yet to take charge of
the dining room for the coming year.

FROM CASA GRANDE
Dan Peart, a member of the class
of 1912 at the Normal came in from
Casa Grande Wednesday evening to
be able to take part in the annual
encampment of Company C, N. G. A.

CLEARING SALE
Attention is called to Hyder Bros.’
advertisement in this morning’s pa
per. The semi-annual clearing sale of
the firm commences this morning to
last for two weeks. Many excellent
bargains can be found at the store
and everybody is invited to come in
and see for themselves.

TO LEAVE TEMPE
Miss May Madden, stenographer in
the W. J. Kingsbury law office for
sometime past, has resigned her po
sition at that place and left for
Phoenix yesterday to accept a sim
ilar position with the fair commis
sion.

A NEW BUSINESS HOUSE
It is understood that a new busi
ness house is to be opened up within
the near future in the room recently
made vacant by the move of the
Tempe National Bank. Janitors were
at work yesterday cleaning it out. A
force of men will probably be put to
work within the next few days re
modeling to suit the conveniences of
the new management.

GOOD PICTURES TONIGHT
Manager Goodwin of the Airdome
reports that he has secured some
excellent pictures for the show to be
given tonight.

FROM PHOENIX
John Hyder of the firm of Hyder
Bros. spent yesterday afternoon in
Tempe on business from Phoenix.

FOR THE COAST
Superintendent J. B. Cook of the
Pacific Creamery Company left last
night for Los Angeles on a business
trip in connection with the company.
He will spend a short time with
Mrs. Cook who is already there, how
ever. He expects to return Monday.

FOR THE MOUNTAINS
J. R. Birchett and family left Wed
nesday night for the mountains in
the vicinity of Payson where they
will spend the remainder of the sum
mer.

A NEW SHOP
A new barber shop has recently
been opened up in the quarters made
vacant by the removal of the Row
and Brothers’ shop. It was taken
over yesterday morning by two first
class barbers who have been con
nected with Tom’s place for the past
few weeks.

HOW A BLIND MAN TOLD COLOR
“Is it true,” asked Sallie, “that the
blind can determine color by the
sense of touch?”
“Sure,” said James. “I once knew
a blind man who could tell a red
hot stove just by putting his finger
on it.” —Ladies’ Home Journal.

Stops Scalp Itch
Dandruff and Every Form of Scalp
Disease Cured Quick by Zemo
It is simply wonderful how Zemo
goes after dandruff. You rub a little
of it in with tips of the fingers. It
gets right down into the glands, stim
ulates them, stops the itch, and
makes the head feel fine. No, it isn’t
sticky; Zemo is a fine, clear, vanish
ing liquid. You don’t have to even
wash your hands after using Zemo.
And what a wonder it is for eczema,
rash, pimples and all skin afflictions.
A 25-cent trial bottle at Elvey &
Hulett’s drug store is guaranteed to
stop any skin irritation.
Zemo is prepared by E. W. Rose
Medicine Co., St. Louis, Mo., and is
regularly sold by druggists at $1 a
bottle. But to prove what it will do
at trifling expense Zemo is now put
up in 25-cent trial bottles.

MESA

MEETING OF THE
COMMERCIAL CLUB
Several Matters of Importance Were
Taken up and Discussed and
Committees Appointed.
There was a very good attendance at
the meeting of the Mesa Commercial
Club Wednesday night, and the boost
ers were quite enthusiastic over the
future. The railroad committee re
ported progress in the work of getting
lower rates for the farmers between
Mesa and the coast. So far they had
had no discouragement, which in itself
was gratifying. The question had been
taken up among the business men, the
farmers and railway officials. The al
lied boards of trade has been enlisted
in the movement, and an old time traf
fic man, F. A. Jones, will be in Mesa
tomorrow to attend the meeting of the
allied boards. The committee is get
ting all the figures possible regarding
the proposition of reduced rates and
will endeavor to convince the railroad
officials that it will be to the mutual
advantage of the roads and the farm
ers to make a more favorable rate be
tween the valley points and the coast.
Six dollars cuts off the farmers’ profits
and discourages the growth of alfalfa
for the outside markets. A reduction
to $4 per ton would mean the ship
ping of double the present amount of
hay from this section.
The report of the committee on tele
phone service was heard. The com
mittee reported that the telephone
companies, having just made a combin
ation, it was impossible to learn what
would be done in regard to better ser
vice, but that the manager of the
Mountain States had promised to do
the best he could.
A special committee was appointed
to solicit individual membership in the
club. As the business men are put
ting up from five to ten dollars per
month toward boosting for the valley,
it was believed that the general prop
erty owners should at least contribute
$2.00 per month for the same purpose.
The Commercial Club has made ar
rangements for widespread advertising
of the valley and its resources, partic
ularly the Mesa section, and all who
own property here will be benefitted
by the movement. It is only right that
all who will be so benefitted should
help bear the expense.

PEACHES AND A MELON.
L. V. Guthrie has donated to the
Mesa Commercial Club a fine lot of
Selway peaches, grown on his place in
town. The Selway is said to be a better
peach for marketing than the Elberta,
which it resembles in appearance.
The Selway is a firmer fruit of
better average size and stands ship
ment with much less damage than the
Elberta. Many people claim that the
flavor is also better than its cousin.
A jar of nice Elberta peaches was
also presented by Bailey Ellsworth
from his young orchard north of town.
They are large, beautifully colored and
free from blemish. These, as well as
the Selways of Mr. Guthrie, will be
made part of the club’s window display.
Wednesday morning Bailey Ellsworth
brought a load of fine watermelons to
town for sale to the lovers of that
fruit. Bert Wingar discovered an un
usually large and perfectly shaped mel
on that he thought would look well in
the Commercial Club’s show window;
so he bought it and took it to the club
rooms. The melon weighed 47 pounds
and was twenty-six inches in length.
Many larger melons are reported, but
for a perfectly formed article, the one
grown by Mr. Bailey is hard to beat.

BROTHER AND FAMILY WELL.
Capt. W. J. LeBaron is in receipt
of a letter from his brother B. F. Le
Baron, who is at El Paso, with the
family. The brother writes that they
arrived in El Paso in good shape and
that all are as comfortable as could
be reasonably expected. He says there
are some six hundred refugees from
Colonia Dublan, Chihuahua, where Mr.
LeBaron owns property, and that prac
tically the entire population of the col
ony are across the border. The men
will probably return to the scene of
the trouble as soon as the families are
cared for.

SPENT AFTERNOON IN MESA.
Messrs. Bawden and Beller, partners
of W. C. Lemon in the Mesa Steam
Laundry, were over from Phoenix and
spent yesterday afternoon in the Gem
City. The gentlemen will have the
laundry ready to begin business with
in a short time. There are quite a
number of matters that must receive
attention before the mangle can be
started up.

CHILD HURT.
Tuesday the 8-year-old son of Elijah
Allen hitched one of the family horses
to the front axle of an old buggy for
the purpose of taking a ride. When
the wheels ran the buggy onto the heels
of the animal the latter began to kick
and the boy was struck on the head.
He was unconscious for some time,
but has not been seriously injured and
is getting along nicely.

FELL FROM BOX.
Mrs. Millman is laid up from injuries
received a couple of evenings since.
She was standing on a box on the porch
of her residence when she slipped and
fell to the ground, some five or six
feet. Her shoulder is quite badly
bruised and a sprain of the right arm
will cause trouble for some little time.

ATTEMPTED TO SNEAK.
A Yaqui working on the street gang
attempted to make a getaway yester
day morning. Street Supervisor J. W.
Horsley had taken the man to break
fast and was standing outside to await
the Indian’s return. The latter fin
ished his breakfast, and noticing that
his keeper was not especially vigilant,
started out the back way. Special Of
ficer O. L. Pickens happened to be in
the restaurant, and saw the man leave
by the back way. He followed and
soon had the Yaqui again in charge.
Mr. Horsley was somewhat surprised
when Pickens and the prisoner ap
proached him from behind and he
found that the man had attempted to
“jump the job.” Hereafter, he will
keep a string attached to the men
while they are at meals.

LAND OWNERS’ MEETING.
A meeting has been called of the
land owners of the Higley section to
be held at the home of F. M. Atwood,
Monday evening next to take action
under the new law which permits the
formation of an irrigation district.
While the law does not go into effect
until the 26th, the farmers can meet,
organize and get their surveys and all
other data ready for action.

“THE REFERENDUM.”
Conductor Sparks, of the Arizona
Eastern, was in Mesa yesterday solic
iting signers to petitions to invoke the
referendum on a number of bills, re
lating to regulation of railways, which
were passed by the late legislature.
One of them related to the kind of
headlights; another to number of men
that must be employed on the trains;
another to the 3-cent fare measure and
another to semi-monthly pay days. He
took the matter up with the Mesa Com
mercial Club directors, but the latter
decided that as a strictly commercial
organization for boosting purposes, it
was hardly the proper thing to take
action as a body, either to approve or
disapprove the circulating of the pe
titions; that was a matter entirely for
the individuals to settle. Mr. Sparks
thanked the board for their fairness in
the matter, and proceeded to canvas
for signers. He met with excellent
success, but learned something in his
rounds. Parties who were ardent sup
porters of the “initiative,” the recall
and the referendum” when the matter
was before the public gave him a Klon
dyke reception (not all of them of
course), while many who opposed such
an innovation on the part of Arizona,
willingly lent their names to help get
the question before the voters. They
evidently acted on the principle that if
the state has such a law everyone
should be given an opportunity to in
voke it, no matter whether the signer
approved or disapproved of the meas
ure under fire.

VISITING ON COAST.
Chas. Mickley of the firm of Mickley
& Sanger, is now a widower. Mrs.
Mickley went to Los Angeles this
week to visit with a son who is at
tending a medical college in that city.
She will remain until the latter part
of next month.

BIBLE STUDENTS IN TOWN.
Tuesday night a large party of the
Loyal Sons Bible Class of the Christian
Church, Phoenix, came to Mesa in an
auto truck. The party was accompan
ied by Pastor E. N. Phillips and had a
delightful time. They rode over the
city, sang songs, ate ice cream and
drank lemonade. The sons were not
alone, as they brought the girls of the
Philathea Class with them.

HANDSOME FURNITURE.
M. P. Holladay is installing some
very handsome and substantial furni
ture in his place of business. The fur
niture consists of settees, four seats to
a single piece, two and two back to
back, with a high single walnut back
between. On top of each piece will
be an electric bulb. The seats are up
holstered. J. B. Cram, who makes
“anything in wood,” was the archi
tect. The tables are also very hand
some and substantial.

HE GAVE HIMSELF
THE WORST OF IT

Francisco Duarte Escaped With a Sus
pended Sentence.
Francisco Duarte yesterday pleaded
guilty to the crime of grand larceny
when it was discovered that he had
really committed a lesser offense. He
was then adjudged to be guilty of petty
larceny and was given a suspended
sentence.
It was suspected that Duarte had
been implicated in the theft of a horse
and saddle near Mesa. He fled with
another Mexican to California and
was arrested at Los Angeles. 
It turned out that Duarte had nothing
to do with the theft though he
afterward had a guilty knowledge of it
and he sold the saddle which he knew
had been stolen.

HAYDEN

HAYDEN, July 31 — Walter Nash
arrived Wednesday from his vacation
of two weeks at McCabe, Ariz., near
Prescott. It seems Walter was not
favorably impressed with his recent
existence here as a “summer wid
ower,” as he brought Mrs. Nash with
him on his return.
Will Nash, who recently received
his appointment to the naval academy
at Annapolis, is in Hayden for a short
visit with his brother, Walter Nash.
At an early date Will will leave for
Annapolis to enter a preparatory
school there, where he will fit him
self for the examinations which he
will have to pass about a year hence
before he can be admitted to the
academy.
Later developments in the case of
Priminteo Molino, the Mexican who is
held by the authorities here, charged
with stealing firearms from a num
ber of our citizens, is that he was re
cently an inmate of the reform school
at Benson and was released on proba
tion. He is only about nineteen years
of age. His case has been taken up
with the management of the school,
and he is now being held pending
further advices from that quarter. In
addition to the three pistols taken
from the Ray Consolidated dormitory,
which have already been mentioned in
these columns, another very valuable
pistol has been recovered and identi
fied as the property of a man in Ray,
from which place Molino came to
Hayden. With the apprehension of
Molino a source of considerable an
noyance to the local authorities has
been removed.
General Mill Foreman B. H. Dozen
bach has been ill recently and is tak
ing a vacation of several weeks, which
has been spent in the Salt River val
ley up to the present, but he has now
been joined by General Mill Foreman
R. F. McRea, and they will together
spend a few weeks on the Pacific
Coast before returning to Hayden.
Deputy Walter Gibson has gone to
Globe, having in charge a prisoner,
Luis Meranda, who received a ninety
day sentence in the justice court here
a few days ago.
