SHOWING OF FACTS

BY BOARD OF TRADE

PARTIAL RECORD OF THE LAST

YEAR'S WORK.

Some of the Things It Hopes to Ac
complish This Year.

Now that the board of trade direc
tors are vigorously pushing a cam
paign for the raising of money for the
maintenance of the board and the ad
vertising of the valley for the next
year, it is very timely to recall a few
facts that will give the public some
thing of an idea of the work of the
board. One could write a book on the
subject and then not tell all that the
board has done for the good of this
city, county and territory and on the
other hand, every observing person
knows that the board has done a great
deal of good. Few however appreciate
how much it has done, or recall on the
instant the proof of its real value. But
to strengthen the faith of the faint
hearted or those who might ask to
be relieved of their part of the natural
support of the board, the following
lists have been furnished by its pres
ident. The first one tells of just a
part of the board's work during the
past year, which was not a very nota
ble one either, and the second list re
cites some of the things the board
hopes to accomplish during the next
year, together with a showing of some
facts concerning the organization.

This is a very refreshing drink and
is especially recommended for the
invalid to whom a cooling drink with
tart flavor is appetizing. Boil the
raspberries and strain, and to one
pint of the strained juice add one
pound of granulated sugar. Let it
stand over night. In the morning
boil it again for about ten minutes
and bottle. When serving put two
tablespoons in a glass of cold water.
