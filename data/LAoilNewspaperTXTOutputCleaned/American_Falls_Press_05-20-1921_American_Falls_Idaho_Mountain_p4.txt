SPEAKER FLAYS
BOARD OF TRADE
H. R. Burdick, President, N. D. State
Farm Bureau Says World's Wheat
Crop in 1920 Was Sold 57 Times by
Commission Men.
"The world's output of wheat was
sold 57 times between September first
and April first 1920 on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
"Sixty million dollars in commissions
alone were made on the Chicago
Board of Trade between September
first and April first 1920.
"The bank failures of North Dakota
were not due to the working of the
Nonpartisan League but to five successive
crop failures.
"The solution of our agricultural
problems are economic and not political.
"The sixty-two percent of the price paid
by the consumer for products of the
farm goes to the middleman after the
farmer has sold his product. More
efficient marketing will raise the price
to the farmer and lower it to the consumer.
Farm Profit Small.
"The net profit of an average family
of five on the farm is $480 a year, provided
you add $230 a year for homegrown
products consumed by the farmer and his
family.
"These are times for the farmers to
get together locally and nationally in
the assistance of agricultural conditions
in general.
Thus did H. R. Burdick, president
of the North Dakota State Farm Bureau
cryptically state the agricultural
proposition of today to Southern Idaho
farmers at the Bannock Hotel
Monday afternoon. He was one of the
three speakers and representatives of
the National Farm Bureau Federation
who are touring the northwest to determine
sentiment regarding cooperative marketing
and compulsory 100 percent pooling of products.
Mr. Burdick stated that he was not
a nonpartisan, that in fact two years
ago he opposed Frazier for governor
and was soundly defeated, "I had the
idea," he said, "like a good many of my
friends that I ought to be governor.
When the election was over I found
that I was about the only person in the
state that thought so.
"But if anyone asks me why the
banks in North Dakota have failed I
will tell him that it was not the nonpartisan
league but five successive years of drought
that did the business. I believe that our
agricultural problems are economic and not
political."
Run Against Fraser.
Mr. Burdick explained the marketing
plans of the Wheatgrowers Association
in detail and stated why some plan of
marketing was necessary. He told the
story of a western wool producer that
could find no market for his product and
went to a small New England manufacturer
with his product. There he had it manufactured
into cloth, had the cloth made into clothing
and sold the suits made of virgin wool
for $36 and netted one dollar per
pound on all his wool.
Mr. Burdick explained that what
transpired for the grain grower would soon
be effected for the stock grower as well.

A GO THAT MAY MAKE HIM RICH
He Bought A Sand Lot Seven Years
Ago
Judge Oliver owns a sand lot 30
miles east of Los Angeles and a few
feet west of a 10,000 barrel oil well—
actual fact. A book agent gave him
a deed to the lot seven years ago and
today it is worth—well nobody knows
how much it is worth.
In 1914 a book agent, Kelly by name,
sold the Judge a set of American Encyclopedias
for $128 and threw in a lot at Huntington
beach as a bonus. The Judge gave the
set away as a present and threw the deed
to the lot in an old trunk, only to feverishly
dig it out again a few months ago. The
agent told Mr. Oliver at the time that the
lot was the biggest bargain he ever
bought and now he is sorry that he
didn't buy several sets of the works.
The First Well.
Last July the Standard Oil Company
brought in the first well in the vicinity
of Huntington Beach in Orange County,
California. Last February, the Utah
and Idaho people who had purchased
the lots organized a company and had
Fred C. Hathaway of Salt Lake arrange
to lease their land to the Globe
Petroleum Company. Terms were that
the property owners were to have one
sixth of the oil and a bonus of $100
each. Judge Oliver received his bonus
yesterday.
The latest news from the field is
that Friday May 13th, the Huntington
Central well on property which is just
twenty feet from the property of the
Utah and Idaho people brought in a
gusher that produces 10,000 barrels of
oil daily.

TO GET TOGETHER
President Howard of National Farm
Bureau Urges Laying Aside of Prejudices
for Great Advantage of Agriculture.
The success of the whole agricultural
industry at the present time requires
that every farmer get behind the county,
state and national farm bureau, according
to President Howard of the National
Farm Bureau before 100 delegates from
southeastern Idaho to a grain growers
meeting at the Hotel Bannock Pocatello,
Monday. Mr. Howard stated that the great
enemies to successful farmer cooperation
were lack of adequate, educated and
efficient management, lack of proper
financing and jealousy in leadership.
Farmers, he stated, are in the habit
of getting by as cheaply as possible with
cheap help, poor management and lack
of brains. They expect a $100 man to fill
the shoes of a $1,000 man, he said.
The success of the present farm bureau
movement he said was doubly insured
because the farmer was financing his own
project. Ordinarily he borrowed the money
necessary to finance his business ventures
and this lost control of his own business.
Leadership jealousies were regarded the
third great source of trouble in
Mr. Howard
farmer organizations,
urged all producers to forget petty jealousies
and unite in a common program
under the leadership and direction
of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

RECLAMATION
The city planner that is expected in
American Falls in the course of a few
weeks will draw $25 daily and expenses.
And he is a comparatively young man.
Topography work is still going on
but on a greatly reduced scale, three
parties having been dispatched to other
locations.
The U. S. R. S. has entered into a
contract with the Boise Chamber of
Commerce to match a ten thousand
dollar fund for the investigation of
the cost of reclaiming the proposed
Mountain Home project. The diversion
point for water for this project
would be the Milner Dam.
Oswald Basin wants to reclaim several
thousand acres out from Idaho Falls. The
settlers there have everything but the
money. Water could be procured only
through the building of the American
Falls dam.
