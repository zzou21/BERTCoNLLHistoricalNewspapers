LEAVES FOR CANYON
ON AN AUTO TOUR

Party of Tempe People on a Two
Months' Overland Trip
S. Z. Earl and Frank Fogal, accom
panied by their families, left yesterday afternoon on a two months' auto
tour in the northern part of the
state. They planned to camp last
evening on the Agua Fria river west
of Phoenix where they will be joined
this morning by L. L. Harmon and
wife. This party planned to leave
last Thursday in company with Dr.
D. G. Devore and C. G. Jones, but
owing to rushing business their de
parture was delayed. The aforemen
tioned two left, according to previous
arrangements though, and are now
camped near Prescott waiting for the
remainder of the party.
Mr. Earl is driving a thirty horse
power Cadillac machine formerly
owned by Mr. Fogal. The latter is
driving a Hudson car which he pur
chased but a short time ago. Both
of the cars have been in the shop
for some time past, having been thor
oughly overhauled and repaired. At
the same time they were fitted out
with the necessary camping equip
ments and when they left yesterday
assembled the popular path-finding
machine which always attracts so
much attention.
Word was received Monday from
Dr. Devore that they had reached
Prescott safely on the second day of
their trip. No accidents had been met
with and all were greatly pleased
with the trip so far. He did say,
however, that the roads seemed to be
unusually bad, but little else could be
expected at this time of year.
As soon as the full party is together they will continue on to the
Verde valley where they plan to
make headquarters. All with the ex
ception of one member of the party,
are members of the board of direc
tors of the Tempe Verde Oil com
pany, which has a large holding in
that valley. They do plan however
to make a number of side trips which
will include the Grand Canyon and
practically all the scenic points in
the northern part of the state.

PULLED OUT
The threshing machine recently re
ceived here by Wm. Strong, agent for
the J. I. Case company, was unloaded day before yesterday and delivered

working off of the one engine.
Women, who bear children and remain healthy are those who prepare
their systems in advance of baby's
coming. Unless the mother aids
nature in its pre-natal work the crisis
finds her system unequal to the de
mands made upon it, and she is often
left with weakened health or chronic
ailments. No remedy is so truly a
help to nature as Mother's Friend,
and no expectant mother should fail
to use it. It relieves the pain and
discomfort caused by the strain on
the ligaments, makes pliant and elastic
those fibres and muscles which
nature is expanding, prevents numb
ness of limbs, and soothes the inflam
mation of breast glands. The system
being thus prepared by Mother's
Friend dispels the fear that the crisis
may not be safely met. Mother's
Friend assures a speedy and complete
recovery for the mother, and she is
left a healthy woman to enjoy the
rearing of her child. Mother's Friend is sold at Mather's.

MANY COMPLAINTS
The city marshal has received a
number of complaints of late in re
gard to loose stock running around
on the streets. He intends to en
force the ordinance on this matter if
the stock are not kept closer tab on.
It does not take a horse or two very
long to destroy a tree along the road
or get into somebody's yard and
tramp everything into the ground.
All live stock found after this, loose
upon the streets, will be promptly
placed in the city pound where it will
cost the owner a little to regain
possession of them.

STILL AT LARGE
Walter Dilman, the man who beat
all his bills here last Sunday is still
at large. No trace of his where
abouts have been found, although at
one time he was reported captured.
That report came here Monday afternoon said to have originated at the
sheriff's office in Phoenix, consequently
it did not take long to spread.
During that time Dilman was evi
dently increasing the distance between Tempe and himself so that it
would be hard to give any possible
conclusions as to where he is now.

BARRING THE WINDOWS
Marquis Rich, proprietor of the
tailor and cutting shop next to the
postoffice, is having a large number
of steel bars made which he proposes
to place over the windows and doors
in the rear of his establishment. A
short time ago somebody broke into
his shop and stole two pairs of
trousers, some that he had just fin
ished in connection with two two
piece suits. Since there were no
more goods left in the wholesale
house to match that, Mr. Rich prac
tically lost two brand new suits of
clothes. He is now making sure that
nothing of the sort will ever hap
pen again, ten bars being placed over
each window, and eight over the door.
HOURS CHANGED
The library hours at the free reading room have been changed to from
four p. m. to six p. m. They were
formerly a half hour earlier than

the change were made.

ON TWO HIGHWAYS
OCEAN TO OCEAN

Mesa Centrally Located So Far as the
State Is Concerned and Will Witness
Passing of All Motorists
It transpires that there are two
ocean-to-ocean highways planned and
both will no doubt become a fact. It
is now certain from the pathfinders'
reports that Mesa will be on both,
should both be constructed. After
crossing the Salt river from the north
side, the road will be along the county
road to Mesa and then along the
Mesa-Roosevelt road to Globe, for all
who follow the continental highway.
If the tourist chooses the Borderland
route he will come to Mesa just the
same and then turn toward the south
and east, going via Gilbert and Higley to Florence, thence to Tucson, etc.
Harry Locke, one of the members
of the Good Roads association, was on
the south side yesterday and visited
Chandler and Higley and mapped the
road from Higley to Mesa. The map
he is now securing will appear in a
guide to the roads of Arizona. This
guide will take up the road system at
the California line and show every
road in the state to the point where
the main roads cross into New Mexico.
There the work will be again
taken up and carried out along the
same lines. Strangers touring Arizona, if they possess one of these
guides, cannot fail to find Mesa. All
roads will naturally lead here, as it is
recognized as being one of the most
important towns on the great route
from ocean to ocean. No other sec
tion of the road will afford a finer
view of the agricultural resources of
the state or more magnificent scenery.
The Mesa section, from this town to
Roosevelt, will give the visitor a view
of the great Fish creek canyon, the
wonderful engineering feat of road
building down into the canyon and
the imposing gorges through which
flows the little stream known as Fish
creek.
N. J. Gorham, Cashier Bank of
Woodville, Ga., had a very severe
attack of kidney trouble and the pains in his kidneys and back
were terrible. "I got a bottle of
Foley Kidney Pills from our druggist
and they entirely relieved me, I have
more benefit from them than any
other medicine." Elvey & Hulett.
o
BETTER SERVICE
On July 15th the Mesa rural delivery
system will be extended to cover
a much wider area than heretofore.
There will be two carriers instead of
one. The new route will be known
as Mesa R. F. D. No. 1, and will sup
ply mail to many who now have to
make regular trips to town to get
their mail. Postmaster Newell has
been working for a long time to se
cure this route and only recently
succeeded in convincing the department that it was an absolute neces
sity. At present the carrier had to
cover twenty-five miles daily, and in
the summer this is quite a task for
both man and beast. The division of
the route, with the added territory,
will make it much lighter on the car
riers and, what is of the most im
portance, will give the rural popula
tion better facilities for securing their
mail promptly. The mail will not be
carried on Sundays.
PARTIALLY PARALYZED
While preparing to dive from a
spring board at the Mesa canal Sun
day, Royal Barney, of Thatcher,
slipped and fell striking on his head
and shoulders. The shock caused par
tial paralysis and the young man is
quite badly hurt. Mr. Barney is vis
iting at the home of Ed. L. Fomeroy
and family.
EARLY GRAPES
Charles Crismon was in town yes
terday from his ranch and brought
an auto load of fine watermelons. In
addition to the melons, he had a few
bunches of Thompson seedless grapes
and a bunch of ripe Lady Downings.
Mr. Crismon does not believe
there are many places in the valley
where Lady Downings are ripening
at this season of the year. His ranch
is most favorably located, the frost
belt having failed to extend to his
section of the valley.
WILL HUNT BEAR
Allen Conklin and W. R. Michels
left yesterday for the Mogollon moun
tains where they expect to remain
during the summer. They say they
will at least stay while the hunting is
good. They expect to find other
game but will make a specialty of
bear. This is the season of the year
when Bruin roams the mountains to
appease his hunger and build up his
system after his winter sleep, and
the Mesa hunters expect to make ex
penses and wages in selling bear pelts
for rugs.
FITTING UP OFFICES
M. J. Dougherty, attorney at law,
with offices at present in the Chandler Court, is having his building, first
door south of the Mesa opera house,
fitted up and when in proper shape
will move in. He will have three
commodious rooms, with book cases
and plenty of space for the building
up of a great library. The rooms will
be fitted up in modern style and will
give a great deal more room than
the present quarters.
CASE SETTLED
A civil case in justice court was
settled yesterday. The Toggery
brought suit against B. C. Irons on an
account. There was a dispute as to
the balance due and the matter was

ROOSEMORE MINING CO.
Messrs. Moore, Smith and A. H.
Parker have formed the Roosemore
Mining company, and are putting a
small amount of stock on the market
for the purpose of developing the
claims which lie twenty-eight miles
to the southeast of Mesa. The prop
erty has a fine surface showing and
the shaft sunk on the ledge so far
shows that the values increase as
depth is obtained. Mr. Parker, who
is an old timer and, on frequent occa
sions a successful mining man, is
sanguine that the company has a big
proposition. He says that the com
pany will need to sell very little
stock as he is confident that the ore
will pay for the development, as soon
as the necessary preliminary work is
completed. Several Mesa men have
taken blocks of the stock, and he has
no doubt that the proposition will
prove a winner.

This year they get a New Perfection Oven
Also a New Perfection Toaster
Also a New Perfection Broiler
"Gee, what a difference in the meals a good stove
makes," said one of the boys. And they will tell their

AMUSEMENTS
THE COLISEUM
The Coliseum was packed to the
full legal limit at the first show last
night and was well filled at the sec
ond performance, a fine testimonial
to the popularity of that amusement
resort. The new bill starts off in
fine feather, the star act being that
of Boyce and Godfrey, the comedy
acrobats. Their stunt alone is worth
the price of admission, for they are
not only acrobats of the first order
but their clownish antics are amusing.
One of them does a fearless
trick in jumping blindfolded from
the top of two barrels set upon a
table, into another barrel at the side
of the stage. A miscalculation might
kill him or cripple him for life. Tucker and Harrison, the rube jokers and
singers, are quite amusing, the lady
being an attractive little body and
her companion, in his stage dress,
contrastingly unattractive. The Watsons have a singing and talking act,
with intervening dances, though in
criticism it should be said that both
these teams are either lacking in
lung power or afraid to speak and it
is noticeable at times.
The news slides are good as usual
including more political pictures. Van
man and his wrecked balloon are
shown, as is also the Corning rail
road wreck. The photoplays are new
and as good as usual.
THE EMPRESS
The Empress was well patronized
again last night at the first show
though the second had a light house.
The full bill was given as shown the
night before and it is an interesting
one. The reel showing "The Post
Telegrapher" is one picture in a thou
sand and it is seldom one has an op
portunity to see so good a one. It is
a superb delineation of an Indian
outbreak and is portrayed with great
naturalness. There are other fine
pictures and along with Emil Spatz
in illustrated songs a good program is
given, one that is rarely seen in a
straight picture house.
AT THE WIGWAM.
Patrons of the Wigwam theater were
given a treat last evening at the open
ing of a new program which will be re
peated tonight and for the last time to
morrow evening. It is one of the best
moving picture shows seen in Phoenix
for some time.
Every one of the four films is en
tertaining. Probably the ones which
delighted the theatergoers the most last
evening were "A Mexican Elopement"
and "The Star Reporter."
The first is a thrilling western scene
and depicts a young Mexican couple
eloping, pursued by their angry par
ents. All are on horseback and they
ride over mountain and desert before
arriving at the parson's home. There
they are married just a few minutes
before being caught by their pursuers.
If you want to see a modern up-to-date
newspaper office such as in the
big cities you will find it in "The Star
Reporter." Jack Wilson is the reporter.
He is a star too. He lands a story
about the failure of a bank which is a
"scoop" for his paper and also withdraws his money deposited in the bank
just as it closes its doors.
"The Wooden Bowl." "The Queen's
Necklace" and "His Mother-In-Law"
are other numbers on the program.
"The Queen's Necklace" is a dramatic
story beautifully staged and power
fully acted.
