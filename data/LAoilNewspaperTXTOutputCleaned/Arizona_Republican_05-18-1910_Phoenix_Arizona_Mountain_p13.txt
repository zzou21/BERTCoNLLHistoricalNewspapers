Miss Hollisier of Evanston, Ill., national organizer of the W. C. T. U.,
was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. L. R.
Rousseau Wednesday and Wednesday
evening, accompanying Mrs. Rousseau to
Fowler Thursday morning. Wednesday
she gave a very entertaining
talk at the church to a fair sized
audience. A map was exhibited show
ing the area in the United States
which was free from saloons and the
section in which whisky is sold. In
speaking of the south being almost
wholly dry, Miss Hollisier said that
the cause usually given, that of liquor's
harmful effect upon the negro, was
only partly the cause. She gave as the
main cause the wonderful advantages
the south had over the north. Nowhere
is there such a pure American citizen
ship as in the south, there being a
small per cent of foreigners. She says
that while many foreigners make good
citizens in other respects, it is the man
from over the seas who clamors for
liquor and will have it. There are
also few large cities in the south
where the saloon element can fortify
its power, and no large breweries in the
north where political parties are so
fiercely divided. Each party is around
some issue which may throw
the vote to its opponent. This can
seldom do so in the South.
That instead of becoming a political
question the worldly question remains as
it should, a moral question, and
easily disposed of. Miss Hollisier
cited a number of instances to dis
prove the statement that a town is
ruined when deprived of saloons. The
example given of business men in
the south is that business has increased
wonderfully. Miss Hollisier lectured
at Fowler and West Pinal and advised a
W. C. T. U. in this part of the valley.

Levi K. Heard was out through

ing taking pictures for advertising pur
poses. He took the picture of Stanley

Tuesday night being the first Tues
day after the 14th, is the time for meet
ing of the Dairymen's Co-operative
Association at the home of Stanley How
ard. Only a few have seen fit to at
tend these meetings, so that the hard
work has fallen rather heavily upon
them, but the good results of their work
are very apparent for the month of
April. It was easy for some when they
joined the association to dream dreams
that the association would compel the creameries to
pay a fabulous price for butter fat regardless of the price of butter. Then
when they found that there were other
interests to be considered besides their
own desire for a high price, they lost
courage and said the association was doing nothing.
The price for April is what the association is
fighting for. The interest and
doing nothing
alone shows
to-morowing. Last year for April the
dairymen received 40 cents for butter fat.
This year they received 43 1-2 cents
with the wholesale price of butter just
the same as it was in April of last
year. If more dairymen would join
the association still more effective
work might be done. If those who al
ready belong would attend the regular
monthly meeting more could be ac
complished. The few who do attend
hesitate to make any radical moves
without the sanction of the majority
of members. It is urgently requested
that there be a good attendance at the
meeting Tuesday night.

sary. Elvy & Hulitt endorse every
word of this.
