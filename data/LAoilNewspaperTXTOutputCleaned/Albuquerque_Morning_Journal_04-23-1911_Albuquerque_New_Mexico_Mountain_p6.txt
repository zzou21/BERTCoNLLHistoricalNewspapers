V 11.1 WOLTLLK.
The lain Noun Webster and other
gentlemen who have compiled the
dictionaries now in general vogue did
well enough in their way; but no
other theory save ignorance of New
Mexico's fight for statehood can ac-
count for the gross paucity of adjectives
in all the volumes available.
The supply is far inferior to the de-
mand. To be sure we have such a
large and varied assortment through
the miracle of the present statehood
movement and the drain on any im-
ply would be heavy; but it has about
reached the limit.
Look at it another way. H. H. Fer-
guson of this city, J. D. Hinton, A. A.
Jones and W. H. McGill, professing to
represent the sentiment of the demo-
cratic party of New Mexico have
come out flat-footed and brazenly in
Rn ttcnipt to THE VOTERS OF
NEW MEXICO. No amount of ex-
cuse, no explanation from democratic
home, no appeal to patriotism, no pretense
from any quarter can cover the un-
patriotic, contemptible attempt
to defeat the admission of New Mexico.
The people of New Mexico have
had enough of H. H. Ferguson.
They stood for his article brunted at-
tack on every move made by the con-
stitutional convention with forethought
and chivalry. People bore in mind
the fact that Ferguson had in years
past done real service to the terri-
tory; they recognized now that every
effort to publish appreciation has been
cancelled and nullified by his work
during the past week. Mr. Ferguson
has none on record as a foe to state-
hood. He expressly and plainly com-
mitted himself, after the reconfirm of
the 18,000 majority for the constitu-
tion ballot to the will of the people. He
went out of his way to commit him-
self as an advocate in the vote
of the people. On the heels of that
he has broken every promise and
pledge made after the election; he
has thrown his word to the winds
and plotted to attain into the thin air
AGAINST STATEHOOD. No protest
of his dishonest motive will now avail
Mr. Ferguson this time. The public
patience has given out and he will
find the people of New Mexico will know
where to find him as well as J. D.
Hinton, W. H. McGill and A. A. Jones.
In the blindness of their own effort and
with no idea of New Mexico's future
have as a place to play petty politics,
these men have fixed on the moment when
prospects were most favorable to make
another fight to defeat the will of the PEOPLE OF
NEW MEXICO.
The constitution drawn was
ratified by one of the most tremendous
majorities ever polled in New
Mexico,
Mr. Ferguson admitted to a
representative of this paper, after the
ratification election, that it was evi-
dent that the people of New Mexico
were willing to accept that constitu-
tion it it would bring statehood.
With Michigan in sight Mr. Ferguson,
the "I bu m en fit to put himself
and his political schemes in the way of
the will of the people of New Mexico.
Taking advantage of the recognized
fact that any bunch of knockers can
possibly delay at a crucial moment. Mr. Ferguson
him brazenly stood up before the people of the
territory and told them that their (le-
gislative) rights must be sacrificed to the il-
l will of himself, Mr. Jones, Mr. Hinton
and Mr. McGill and the small bunch
of men behind them in private. Their
position is that if we can block state-
hood, well, we the people must
suffer it.
He has authorized the use of the
destruction of the destiny of New
Mexico," Ferguson hint the people.
"Self till the people, Mr. Ferguson
and his lieutenants at the poll in a
manner which would make a man at
best withdraw himself from the public
eye and stay in retirement.
It is interesting to find them gentle-
men in the lotup itn of H. K. Nicholson,
national chairman of the Anti-Hay-
wood league, who brought before the
House committee of the House
COHORT act of the most malicious loua,
FILTHY DEEPLY DISHONEST, lies which were brandid
by thousands of the people of this
territory in a flood of indignant elate-
ments which he finally had to hunt the ii Tit
committee. Perhaps Mr. Nicholson, when
he presented these to the committee the first
time, believed some of it was true
now he knows it all a compila-
tion of spectacular lies. Mr. Nicholson
is not resident of New Mexico
and knows nothing about New Mexico; he is another of the Holler-Than-Thou
crowd, who would give con-
gress instructions as to what the 300,
000 people of New Mexico shall do
and what they shall not do.
The disgruntled democrats of this
territory throw their lot with the
foreign peddlers of falsehoods, ho

stile to wreck the state of New
Mexico on the rock of their own
puffed up roguery.
If statehood is killed by
resumption of this delay in the House
committee on territories, it will
be the work of these peanut politics chieftains accomplish the
defeat of our admission, New Mexico
knows now where to place the re-
sponsibility at the door of the demo-
cratic party. If the democratic party
does not sanction the work of these
politicians at Washington, it had better
go on record quickly. If the demo-
cratic party of New Mexico places
statehood above party advantage, it
had better make its position known
at once. If the democratic party of
New Mexico recognizes H. H. Ferguson
as its standard bearer, well and
good. The democratic party in that
case stands for want of political
tact and statehood for a rotten com-
monwealth; it stands for personal ad-
vantage against the development of a
great southwestern empire; it stands
for machination, not progress; for
contemptible political juggling,
for a life interest and not for the pub-
lic weal. For every month that the
democratic party as represented by
Mr. Ferguson delays the admission
of New Mexico into the union it will
lose thousands of its voting strength
in New Mexico. Such activity as that
of Mr. Ferguson reflects shame on
the party and shame on the territory;
to whose everlasting discredit be it
said, that traitors from home have al-
ways arrived at the crucial moment
to block the wheels of statehood
when everything was running,
smoothly.

A PUBLIC MATTER
Every business man in Albuquerque
who is interested in the health of his
city should make it a point to attend
the meeting at the Central High
school next Thursday evening at
which further steps will be taken to
complete the organization of a local
anti-tuberculosis society.
The large attendance at the first
meeting held during the past week
indicates a fluttering interest in the
proposition. The interest, however,
should be wider and greater. The
proposed organization is one whose
activities will benefit every man,
woman and child in the city. The
health of the city means the prosper-
ity of the city; more strict sanitary
regulations against the spread of dis-
ease will mean a corresponding bene-
fit to every man who has business in-
terests in Albuquerque. The pro-
posed society contemplates a cam-
paign of education. It proposes to
awaken the people to the importance
of protecting themselves and their
visitors against the scourge of Ameri-
ca at the present day. The develop-
ment of New Mexico into the nation's
sanitarium brings corresponding re-
sponsibilities for the people of New
Mexico, and the first thing necessary
is to become familiar with the na-
ture of the problem which is to be
solved. If every inhabitant has an
intelligent idea of what tuberculosis
is, an intelligent idea of how it is
to be solved, if every inhabitant has
an intelligent idea of how it is
communicated, and how to avoid
such infection, the situation is greatly
simplified. Health seekers are
coming to New Mexico in increasing
numbers; we must make preparations
to let them get the fullest benefit
from the climate without endangering
the health of our own people. It
can be done effectively if certain
simple precautions are strictly ob-
served at all times. This society has
a field for tremendous usefulness and
it ought to have the fullest co-operation
from every citizen.
A MINING STRIKE.
"Why," asked a well known engi-
neer in this city yesterday, "are the people going through
here to Loswell and to Iteming to get a ranch to irrigate by pumping? Why don't they
stay in Albuquerque. We have the
land and the water and the pip-
ing; crops are as sure and the expense is
less."
We believe it's all in the start. Bos-
well, with her magnificent irrigation
country is attracting wide attention
with pumping systems which it has
been found will greatly extend the ir-
rigable area. Iteming has already
made a spectacular success of the
pumping plan and has advertised that
success far and wide. And in no
other section are the money-making,
opportunities open to the pump that
are found right here in the Rio
Grande valley.
What we need is a beginning. The
machine will run itself when once
started. What we need to do is
to make such an initial success of the
pumping scheme that it will attract
the attention of the west. To him
that hath shall be given; every well
that is pumped makes another well
much more likely. The very name
"Rio Grande valley," or "Mimbres valley"
means success to the prospective farmer or investor. He doesn't need to
be shown. It is high time that Al-
buquerque takes things in hand so that
Central Rio Grande" will be equally
synonymous with success.
We are just beginning to realize
the possibilities. An enterprising
farmer on the mesa has started to
pump water 4,000 feet to irrigate his
own land. If he succeeds we should
advertise the fact; get more deep
wells, more shallow wells, more
pumps and engines. It's easy after
you have made a beginning; here, as
was the case on the Pecos and the
Mimbres it will take a tremendous
effort to start the ball rolling; after
that its own momentum will lift the
rest.
Nothing succeeds like success.
We note that the Presbyterians, in
Pima county, express confidence in
Rev. S. S. Wagner, stating that "a paper of the
standards of the Morning
Journal should give publicity to the
report sent in by an officious lawyer
in the House when the real facts might
have been obtained." We would
call the attention of the ministers to
the fact that the facts as set forth in
the Morning Journal article
published in this paper
coincide with the facts
as set forth by the presbytery. The
Morning Journal did not convict Mr.
Wagner of any wrong doing, but gave
the news of the case; and gave exactly
the same publicity to the defense of
Mr. Wagner.
This paper has followed in this case

its usual policy of printing the news
without fear or favor, and the "re-
grets of the presbytery are entirely
uncalled for. The only inaccuracy in
the first report that the minister was
actually imprisoned, was at once cor-
rected when it was discovered that
bond had been furnished.

not being able to hold on for the big

prove that although royalty com-
mands a high salary it is a great
drawing card,
IT MIGHT BE A WISE Idea to
meet some of the returning New Mex-
ico knockers at the Raton pass and
tell them that we are not at home.
THE DEMOCRATIC sore heads form
a good barometer. When they are do-
ing nothing you may guess that
statehood is humming; when they
are out with the hammer you may be
assured that chances for admission
are improving.

A.H. HARLLEE
Committee of Judicial District
Eulogize Late Leader of New!
Mexico Bar Who Recently
Passed Away.
Special Correspondent to Morning Journal
Silver City, N. M., April 11. Fol-
lowing is the report of the commit-
tee in the Seventh Judicial district
court on the death of Arthur H. Harl-
lee, esq.:
To the Hon. Albert C. Mechem,
Judge of the Seventh Judicial Dis-
trict Court of New Mexico:
Your committee upon the death of
Arthur H. Harllee, esq., beg leave to
report:
Mr. Harllee was a native of Sum-
ter, S. C. He came to Silver City, a
young man, in the fall of 1882, and
was admitted to the bar in that year,
in the December term of the district
court for Grant county. He resided
and practiced law at Silver City from
his admission to the bar until his
death, which occurred in Silver City
on the morning of March 18th, 1911.
Mr. Harllee brought to the prac-
tice of his profession broad and pro-
found legal learning, a calm and dis-
criminating judgment, and an untir-
ing industry, which has seldom been
equalled and never excelled among
his professional brethren. Both in
and out of his profession, he was a
scholar; a great lover and accumu-
lator of books and possessed a fine
literary taste. In mind and tempera-
ment he was essentially judicial; he
had none of that extreme partisan-
ship and one-sidedness of view which
often characterizes the successful ad-
vocate. He was not eloquent and he
never attempted to use any of the
arts of oratory. In speech he was
deliberate, often hesitating; yet on
occasion he could present a matter,
whether to judge, jury or public aud-
ience with an impressiveness, a
breadth of view, and fairness of
statement which proclaimed the care-
ful study and logical thinker.
Such a man does not meet with
sudden success in the legal profes-
sion. But his advance, if slow, is cer-
tain. In the earlier years of his pro-
fessional career Mr. Harllee was ap-
pointed master of chancery in many
important cases, where his eminent
fairness, learning and industry were
displayed; his findings, whether of
law or of fact, were rarely, if ever,
set aside and he demonstrated the
usefulness and importance of that
decried office.
During the last decade of his life
Mr. Harllee enjoyed a large and luc-
rative practice. In his own district
he was facile princeps, and he was
universally recognized as one of the
leaders of the New Mexico bar.
He was a member of the consti-
tutional convention in 1910, and dis-
charged his duties in that position
with the learning, candor and en-
ergy, which ever characterized him.
In the death of Arthur H. Harllee
the legal fraternity has lost a most
estimable member and New Mexico
a valued citizen.
We recommend the adoption of
the foregoing, and that the same be
spread upon the records of the court.

Sixty-Five Blocks of Streets
Graded; Sanitary Condition
Splendid; Thousands of Trees
Set Out.
(Special Correspondent to Morning Journal
Carlsbad, N. M., April 22. The
city administration elected a year ago
is still on the job. Extensive im-
provements are being made this
spring. Annually sixty-five blocks will
be graded by the end of the month,
fifty blocks being already completed.
This district has been made a sprink-
ling district and regular sprinkling of
the streets will begin May 1st. In all
directions the town has had a general
cleaning up. Practically every place
has connected with the sewer, after
much urging by the authorities. The
condition of Carlsbad has never been
so good in the history of the town.
H. Mclennan, the mayor, is
about early and late, directing the
improvements under way. It is a
matter of pride with the mayor to
make the town sanitary and beauti-
ful. R. M. Thome, the street com-
missioner, has given much time to
the street work now nearing com-
pletion. They have had the backing of
the entire board; Judge C. H. Price,
O. M. Cooke, and W. S. Jolley.
Mayor McLennan and J. S. Os-
borne have put the city park in
shape. Two months ago it looked
worse than the city dump. It is now
graded and set out to trees of many
kinds. The trees are coming and be-
fore long the city park will be the
pride of the town.
V. H. Tracy has set out trees along
the streets in North Carlsbad and
otherwise improved this part of the
town. Major K. P. Hutto and others
have set out about 6,000 trees along
the banks of the Pecos river. The
Cemetery association has had the
cemetery enclosed and set out a large
number of trees. The Santa Fe rail-
way is fixing up the grounds around
the depot, building concrete walks
and slicking up the park north of
the depot. The roads into town are
being graded and bridges put in root
order. Concrete bridges are being
built whenever a new bridge is need-
ed. On the whole Carlsbad has never
had the overhauling that it is under-
going this year, public-spirited cit-
izens are at the helm and take pride
in the clean well-kept municipality.

How Old People
May Prolong
Their Lives
At advanced age the organs act
more slowly than in youth. Circu-
lation becomes poor, blood thin and
watery, appetite fitful, and diges-
tion weak. This condition leaves
the system open to disease such as
Coughs, Colds, Grippe, Pneumonia,
Rheumatism, etc.
VINOL is the greatest health
creator and body builder we know
of for old people, as it supplies
the very elements needed to re-
build wasting tissue and replace
weakness with strength.
VINOL IS THE PROOF
A case is recorded in Albany, N. Y. of
a woman who told the way breaking
down by age and illness to the
weak and feeble condition of old people.
She had no strength and the slightest ex-
ertion tired her, but Vinol made her
well and strong, and she alleges that she
feels ten years younger than she is. Before taking Vinol,
We ask every aged person in
this neighborhood to try a bottle
of VINOL with the understanding
that we will return their money if it
does not prove beneficial.
