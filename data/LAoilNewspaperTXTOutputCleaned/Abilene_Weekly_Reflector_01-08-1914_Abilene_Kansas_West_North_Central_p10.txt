CAPTAIN WINS IN BATTLE

Puts Pirate and Accomplice In Arm
tun I Brings Them to Port and
Federal Authorities Take
Charge
IT B D U VAL
San Francisco, Jan. 3. A sea
rover in Arctic trade turned pirate,
Andrew B. Nelson, himself a mas
ter mariner and one time owner of
the schooner Hera, was brought to

port in irons, locked in the brig of
the steam lumber schooner William
ette, and turned over to the federal
authorities, who held him in $10,000 ball on a charge of assaulting
Captain Reiner on the high seas
with intent to murder.
With him was brought Joseph
Laramie, a bricklayer, charged with
being an accomplice in the crime.
He was held in the same ball. Neither
man will admit that he knows
the other.
Nelson was arrested after a hard
fought battle in the captain's cab
in, which he had entered muffled
in a towel, wearing a brown wig as
thick as that of a woman and as palpably
false, a false mustache and carrying
in his outstretched hand a
semi-automatic pistol in his
stretched hand.
Though disarmed, he drew a double action revolver. He was getting the better of
the captain when two sailors and
a waiter rushed into the room and
overpowered Nelson and ironed
him. Laramie stood outside the door.
The Willamette carried $1,500 in
cash and there were 26 passengers
on the quartered aft. A launch fol
lowed the vessel, keeping distant
about half a mile for some time, and
Captain Reiner believes the pirate
intended to rob the safe and hold
up the passengers for their cash and
valuables and make his escape to
shore in the launch.

Senator Bristow May Speak Up In
Topeka

Kansas City, Jan. 3. Tonight
Kansas may learn whether Senator
Joseph L. Bristow's allegiance is to
go to the Progressive or to the
Republican party, but not until
then.
Senator Bristow was at the Blos
som House last night on his way to
Topeka and Salina. "I have been

keeping in touch with the Kansas
political situation or what the news
papers say the situation is, but I am
not ready to talk tonight," he said.
"It may be that I shall make a
statement at Topeka tomorrow
night."

SECRECY IN MR. LIND'S VISIT

President Wilson Will Tell Nothing
About the Conference

Pass Christian, Miss., Jan. 8.
President Wilson and John Lind,
his personal representative in Mex
ico are deeply absorbed in a dis
cussion of the Mexican situation.

It was their first meeting since
last July, when the president con
ferred with Mr. Lind at the white
house preparatory to the latter's
departure for the City of Mexico.
For two days a mysterious reti
cence has been apparent at the pres
idential cottage, concerning the
present conference. When dispatch
es from Vera Cruz announced that
Mr. Lind would come to Pass Chris
tian, there was a noticeable mani
festation of displeasure among the
members of the president's party
that his destination should have
been made public. President Wilson

The same effort at secrecy with

respect to the Chester's whereabouts

was frustrated by wireless news of

her location near Ship Island. No
announcement has been made of the
results of the conference.

So Hodges Speaks of Plan for Com
mission Legislature

Topeka, Jan. 2. Gov. Hodges
does not want to make the commis
sion legislature for a state a politi
cal issue, but hopes that the move
ment for better state government
will follow the demands of the peo
ple of Kansas for more efficient gov
ernment. It probably will not be
made a part of the Democratic plat
form. The governor wants the
commission government for a state

to be a big non-partisan movement
as was the demand in Kansas for
commission government for the cit
ies which were forced through the
legislature by the non-partisan sup
port of every good citizen over the
combined opposition of the politi
cians of all parties.

New York, Jan. 3. The withdraw
al of J. P. Morgan & Co. from more
than a score of great corporations
and the statement shortly afterward
by George F. Baker, an almost
equally dominant figure in Ameri
can finance, that he would soon take
similar action, gave Wall street
generally a thrill which almost
brought trading on the stock ex
change to a halt.
While it is not true that

many of the prominent bankers hadis,ate-

information foreshadowing this mo
mentous move toward ending Inter

locking directorates, the public and
brokers had no suspicion of what was
taking place in the inner councils of the greatest of all
American houses of finance. Wher
ever telephone and ticker flashed
the news about the street groups of
men gathered to discuss what was
the all absorbing topic.
Mr. Morgan says "The necessity.

of attending many board meetings
has been so serious a burden upon
our time that we have long wished
to withdraw from the directorates
of many corporations. Most of these
directorships we have accepted with
pleasure and not without a feeling
that we were constrained to keep in touch with
the properties which we had organ
ized and whose securities we have
recommended in the market both

here and abroad.
"An apparent change in public
sentiment in regard to directorships
seems now to warrant us seeking to
resign from some of these connec
tions. Indeed, it may be in view
of the change in sentiment upon
this subject, that we shall be in a
better position to serve such prop
erties as securityholders if we are

not directors."

Topeka, Jan. 2. Gov. Hodges is
going to help the Kansas Motor Car
association in its campaign for a
highway commission to have gener
al supervision of the highway im
provement work of the state.
"This commission ought to be ex
pert road builders," said the gov
ernor. "The commission would be
advisory and not intended to be in
absolute control of the road work.
When a county decided on road im

provement work it would ask the
commission for advice. The com
mission would send its engineers to
that county. The commission would
then make up a set of plans and
specifications for a complete road
improvement work for the entire i

county.
"Then the work could go ahead
and the county build part of the
roads planned this year and another
section next year. All the work
would be a part of a general road
plan for the county. It would stop
the piecemeal road work now in the

TEST THE EUGENICS
LAW IN WISCONSIN

Milwaukee, Wis., Jan. 3. Steps
were taken to bring a test suit to
determine the constitutionality of
the eugenics law which requires male

persons to present a doctor's cer
tificate showing a clean bill of
health.
The law went into effect Thurs
day and Alfred A. Peterson and
Hattie J. Schmidt, each 29 years

old, were the first to seek a license.
They were accompanied by an at
torney and when County Clerk Wi
lule refused them a permit because
the intended bridegroom did not

have a physician's statement of
pure health, action was begun.
Peterson, with his attorney, be
gan a search for a doctor who would
examine him for $3, the price pre
scribed in the law.

one hundred divorces were granted
there.

ties did not have a divorce in the

REACHED DECISION
FIVE MINUTES

Tried on Penitentiary Charge
Theft of Pineapple Syrup
From Box Car

A penitentiary sentence faced A. I
Grierson late yesterday afternoon
when his case went to a district
jury. He was charged with
breaking a seal on a box car in
Herington and taking from the car
a two-gallon jug containing pineap-
ple syrup for soda fountain use, J
valued at $2. The jury was out
for more than five minutes when it
returned a verdict for acquittal.

That the verdict was in
with the wishes of the hearers who
filled the court room was evident
from the outburst of applause that

greeted the verdict.
Judge King to rap for order.
The box car was broken into in
Herington, and Grierson, then an employee
of the company, was charged with
both sides.

thought it contained booze. Attorney
Hurd based the prosecution entirely on circumstantial evi-
dence, but the case for the state was
too strong. The defense ar-
gued that the theft was committed
by someone unknown to the court,
Judge King instructed the jury to
find the defendant not guilty unless
the circumstantial evidence was
such that any other theory of the
theft was clearly inconsistent.
Grierson, who now lives at Kan-
as City, was defended by W. W.
McCanless, now of Kansas City, who
as county attorney conducted the
prosecution in the famous "tar
party" case at Shady Bend. A dam
age suit instituted by Grierson
against the Rock Island was hinted
at yesterday in the court room.
Refuses Habeas Corpus Writ
Judge King refused a writ of ha-
beas corpus applied for by Attorney

John Hessin of Manhattan, asking
for the release from a sanitarium
at Bonner Springs of John Louber,
a retired business man of Junction
City. Louber was adjudged insane in
a probate court hearing, and Judge
King ruled that it was not within
his jurisdiction to go into the mat

ter of Louber's sanity.
Parole for Milford; Brownell Insane
William Milford this morning

pleaded guilty to the charge of ac
cessory after the fact in connection
with the arson cases at Herington.

Judge King suspended sentence
pending Milford's good behavior and
Milford left at once for his home

in Kingman county. The charge
against Milford was changed from
arson to the one to which he pleaded

guilty. The sentence could be
made five years in the penitentiary
but the charge will not be pressed

unless Milford gets into trouble

again.
Milford was running a shoe store

in Herington when the fire was set.

Because of debts and poor out-
comes, he was persuaded by the others to join
with a wife and two oaoies. i"

I'nlon Young People s Meeting
A meeting of the Abilene Union
of Young People's Societies will be
held at the Christian church next
Monday evening, Jan. 12, to hear
Gilbert Fenton, field secretary of
the Kansas State C. K. Union, who
will give an address on Christian
Endeavor principles.
Mr. Fenton seeks to revive interest in church attendance, denomin
ational study, Sunday school evan
gelism and increased financial sup
port of denominational missions. He
has a message that will be of interest to C. E., Epworth League and
other young people's societies in the

city; also workers in every depart
ment of church activities, both old
and young, will receive an inspiration from his message. Everyone
invited.

Obituary F. H. McFerren
Frederick H. McFerren was born
in Franklin county, Pa., Nov. 4,
1877; died Dec. 31, 1913, at his
home at Chapman, aged 36 years.
1 month and 27 days. When three
years of age his parents came to
Kansas, settling southeast of Chap
man. With the exception of six
years spent at Bushton his name has
been in Dickinson county and the
last four years in Chapman, having

a position in the hardware store of
J. L. Larson. He united with the
Lutheran church when 17 years of
age and remained a faithful and
consistent Christian to the end.
During the past year he was super
intendent of the Lutheran Sabbath
school and had his life been spared
would no doubt have been continued
in that position. He was a
willing worker in all departments of church work. He was
united in marriage to Miss Dessie
Dlehl, June 1, 1904, and leaves a
wife, father, mother, four brothers,
four sisters, and a large circle of
relatives and friends to mourn his
early departure. Four nephews, and

two cousins were pall bearers.
The funeral services were held in
the Lutheran church on Saturday
