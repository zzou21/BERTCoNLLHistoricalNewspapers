Golden Belt Petitions
Now Being Signed

MEMBER ASSOCIATED PRESS GREATEST NEWS GATHERING ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD

ABILENE, KANSAS, THURSDAY MORNING, MARCH 20, 1919

NO. 27

Petitions for hard surfacing with
brick or concrete the Golden Belt
from Abilene to Chapman are being
circulated, having been approved by
the state highway commission. The
district extends on the east of Abilene
halfway to the Enterprise road.
East of Detroit it takes in land south
of the river which will be reached by
a new bridge over the Smoky Hill
between Enterprise and Chapman. The
road will be entirely on the north side
of the U.P.R.R. between Detroit
and Chapman.
County Engineer Karl Riddle has
prepared some official figures on the
cost of a hard surfaced road. It is
based on the cost of a road costing
$40,000 a mile. Probably this is
excessive but is taken as a basis to be
on the safe side. The estimate is one
furnished for the Golden Belt
between Abilene and Chapman, an 18
foot brick or concrete road with a
10-foot earth road beside it for tractor
or traffic. The average width of the
district is 4 miles, some distances
are 5 or 8 miles, depending on the
location of the road. Mr. Riddle's
estimate follows:
Cost of road ....$40,000.00 per mile
Paid by govt. 15,000.00 per mile
Paid by county 12,500.00 per mile
Paid by township 6,250.00 per mile
Paid by district 6,250.00 per mile
Average cost as estimated to each
acre and quarter section in the dis
trict for special tax without interest.
These figures are as carefully es
timated as is possible in anticipating
the action of the Board of Appraisers
who will appraise the land in accord
ance with the benefits derived from
the improvement.
The total cost of the eleven miles
will be divided by the total appraised
valuation of the land within the district
and a rate determined. This rate will
then be applied to the appraised value
of each tract and its levy determined.
Of course, as said before, the ap
praised values are in relation to the
benefits derived and not representing
any true value of the land.
First quarter section next the road,
pays 11 per cent of total cost of road;
tax per acre each year for 20 years,
21 cents; total tax per acre, $4.15;
tax per year on quarter section, $34.37;
total tax during the twenty years,
$687.50.

Second quarter section from the
road pays 6.5 per cent of total cost;
12 7/10 cents per acre per year;
total payment per acre 20 years
$2.54; total tax per year, $20.31;
total tax on quarter section in 20
years $406.25.

Third half mile from road pays
5 per cent of cost; 9 cents per
acre per year; total of tax per
acre, $1.80; total tax per quarter
section per year, $15.62; total tax
for 20 years on quarter-section,
$312.50.
Fourth quarter section from road
pays 2 1/4 per cent of cost; 4 9/10
cents per acre per year; total on one
acre in 20 years, $1.95; total per
year on 160 acres, $7.80; total on 160
acres in 20 years, $156.00.
If the state good roads amendment
carries, the state will pay 25 per cent
of the total cost of the road, reim
bursing counties and districts to that
extent for all roads built after March
1, 1919.
When it is remembered that up
keep, now costing $100 to $400 a
mile on the Golden Belt annually is
eliminated and a brick or concrete
road 18 feet wide is provided for the
traffic that ever will be, it is evident
that every farmer will be eager to put
the plan in operation.

DECIDE PRIZES FOR CONTEST.
Teachers' Meeting and Spelling Con
test Week from Saturday.
From Saturday's Daily.)
The county commissioners have
granted three first prizes of $10 and
three second prizes of $5 for the win
ners of the spelling contest to be
held at the courthouse Saturday
morning, March 29. Last year the
prizes were only $5, first prize and
$2.50, second prize and in the grade
school contest there was a tie and the
prize was divided. The test this year
consists of 100 words, written,
which are graded by the judges.
In the afternoon the county teach
ers' meeting will be held and Miss
Julia Stone of Topeka, state super
visor of schools and Prof. M. L.
Smith of Manhattan, supervisor of
rural school education, will address
the teachers. The meeting will be in
the nature of a preparation for the

"Pershing's Crusaders"
Coming to the Lyric

For a year the United States Gov
ernment cameramen have been busy
registering the activities of our sold
ier and sailor boys on thousands of
feet of motion picture film.
As a result, the people of Dickin
son county will have the first chance
on Tuesday evening, March 25 at the
Lyric to see what has been done by
our boys up to date over here and
over there.

"Pershing's Crusaders" is the title
of this first official government fea
ture film of the war, and it really
constitutes a motion picture Malory
of our first year at war.

A successful effort has been made
to picture the government's handling
of the gigantic task of preparation
for war. The recruiting of our army,
the building of huge cantonments, the
clothing and feeding of our troops,
the making of arms to equip them,
the building of enormous ship yards
and the rapidity with which ships are
being built and launched.
You will see our boys in training,
fleets of aeroplanes in dizzying flight,
our great floating fortresses on vigi
lant guard, our swift destroyers
searching the sea for the hated Ger
man periscope.
The greater part of the picture
shows our boys, maybe your boys
in France. It follows them along the
long road to the front. It shows the
vast stores of munitions and supplies
flowing like rivers through the quaint
French villages up to the front line
trenches. It depicts the first Ameri
can field gun to throw a shell into the
German trenches, the first American
troops entering and occupying a first
line trench, the first batch of German
prisoners taken by our soldiers, the
first baptism before a battle.

HAIL AND RAIN AND WIND.

WHAT'S A QUARTER MILLION
TO FORMER ABILENE BOY.
A dispatch from Idaho says re
garding a former Abilene boy: "J.
Kobb Brady, millionaire son of form
er United States Senator Brady, is
still after the Dempsey-Willard fight.
Today Brady wired Tex Rickard,
asking him to consent to a long dis
tance talk from New York with
Brady and Fred Hutz, once Rickard's
partner. They will ask Rickard
under what conditions he will consent
to staging the Willard-Dempsey
match as a 20-round fight in Foca-
tello. Brady is prepared to offer
$10,000 to buy the fight outright,
or, he said, to raise a cool quarter mil
lion if necessary."

County Had Regular Spring Visita
tion of Moisture.
From Saturday's Daily.

GUARDIAN SUES FOR DIVORCE.

Legislature Has
Finished Session

BALING WIRE PUT OUT

THE LIGHT OF HOPE

A few nights ago the city of Hope
was without light. The current was
mysteriously cut off and many were
the complaints against the service.
Repair men were sent out from Abi
lene by the Riverside company and
tracing the lines they found that
someone had tossed a piece of baling
wire into the light company's dis
tribution lead, causing all the street
lights to be burned out and nearly
costing one workman his life as the
wire crossed the current with other
lines. The repairs cost over $100,
the people of Hope were without
light all because of reckless
meddling with electric lines.

Minor at Herlington Accuses Husband
of Cruelty and Gross Neglect.
Daisy Sinclair, through her guar
dian, J. V. DeMand, has sued for di
vorce from her husband, J. K.
Sinclair. They were married in Ra
mona in 1918 when she was 16 years
old and for a time lived together in
Herlington, where she still makes her
home. The husband lives at Hope.
Mrs. Sinclair alleges cruelty and
gross neglect and claims that two
months after they were married they
went to Salina where her husband
refused to pay their board bills and
her clothing which she had bought
herself before being married was held
by the creditors. She says that her
husband made no attempt to redeem
them and has refused to provide for
her, though well able to do so.

(Associated Press
Topeka, March 20. The Kansas
legislature adjourned last night after
completing the appropriation bills.
The appropriation will be the larg
est in the state's history, including in
crease of salaries all along the line.
Compared with previous sessions the
number of new laws adopted is small.
It has passed the following meas
ures of statewide importance:

A stringent anti-profiteering law.
A law authorizing the confiscation
of motor cars carrying liquor into the
state.
Prohibiting any but the English
language in public, parochial and pri
vate schools.
A constructive road and bridge law
which strengthens the measure al
ready in force in the state.
An inheritance tax on direct heirs.
Established a division of Irrigation
in the board of agriculture.
Free dental inspection in all public
schools.
Fixing a gas pressure standard to
consumers of natural gas.
Authorizing cities to levy taxes for
public health nursing.
Fixing a quality test for gasoline
for motor cars;
Ratified the National Prohibition
Amendment.
Abolished the tax rebate.
Extended the Anti-Discrimination
law, making it applicable to individ
uals as well as to corporations.
Appropriated 13 million dollars for
state expenses for two years.
Established an open season for
quail for ten days of each year.
Established inspection of brands
for cattle, horses, mules, sheep and
hogs to prevent theft.

The legislature killed the following
measures which were up for discus
sion:
The repeal of the primary election
law and all attempts to amend the
law.
The so-called Indeterminate fran
chise bill for public utilities corpora
tions. The bill to destroy the industrial
welfare commission.
Home rule for cities.
Practically all measures to regu
late insurance companies.
Amendments to the workmen's
compensation law.
Teachers' pensions.
Transformation of state reserve
bank.

The success men of the country freely declare that
they owe their success mainly to the fact that they
opened a bank account early in life. Then when the
chance for an investment came along they were ready
for it. Youth and energy make a fine combination
but youth, energy and capital are invincible.
YOUNG MAN, BE INVINCIBLE. START A
BANK ACCOUNT WITH US TODAY.

The state shall never be a party
in carrying on any works of internal
improvement except to aid in the
construction of highways and the re
imbursement for the cost of perman
ent improvements of highways, con
structed after March 1, 1919, but
such aid and reimbursement shall not
be granted in any county in which no
aid and reimbursement shall not be
granted in any county in which no
more than 25 per cent of the cost of any
road or highway, nor for more than
$10,000 per mile, nor for more than
100 miles in any one county, except
that in counties having an assessed
valuation for more than $100,000,000
such aid and reimbursement may be
granted for not more than 150 miles
of road or highway; and the restrict
ions and limitations of sections 6 and
0 of article XI of the constitution, re
lating to debts and internal improve
ments, shall not be construed to limit
the authority retained or conferred by
this amendment."

Changes In the Law.
As a special order yesterday after
noon the senate considered the house
permanent roads bill, which amends
the measure enacted into law two
years ago. The most important
change was the striking out of the
provision to force a county commis
sion to act on petitions for roads
within sixty days.
This and other minor amendments
are expected to be concurred in by
the house.

Important changes in the law, are:
The governor is authorized to sign
petitions for any land owned by the
state in the districts and the state will
pay its part.
Petitions may include one or more
types of road instead of one. This
will permit the building of earth roads
and getting federal aid.
Avoid the Bad Points.
The petition may call for the im
provement of roads along new right
of way, that is, a new road may be
located with the petition.
The county commissioners are
authorized to change the route of the
road as described in the petition to
avoid bad hills, railroad crossings
and round corners.
The county may let contracts for
all of the work or may let contracts
for part and may supply all or part
of the materials for the contractors.
County commissioners may pay as
much as 60 per cent of the cost of
the work as it progresses.
Lease Stone Quarries.
The federal aid can be received on
streets in towns of 2,500 population
or less. In towns of the third class
the federal aid will be applied. The
balance of the cost of improving a
street which forms a part of the high
way may be paid by the county and
half by the city commissioners.

The bonds issued for hard roads
are in addition to all other bonds
authorized by law.

Any county can buy or lease any
gravel pit or stone quarry and build
roads for the purpose of securing
road building materials.

The Tenantry Amendment.
The farm "tenantry" amendment
reads: "To encourage the purchase,
improvement and ownership of agri
cultural lands and the occupancy and
cultivation thereof, provision may be
made by law for the creation and
maintenance of a fund, in such man
ner and amount as the legislature
may determine, to be used in the pur
chase, improvement and sale of lands
for agricultural purposes. The legis
lature may provide reasonable pre
ferences for those persons who served
in the army or navy of the United
States in the world war and holding
a discharge certificate."

Topeka, March 15. The last of the
three constitutional amendments to
finally pass both legislative houses,
with all amendments agreed upon,
went through the senate today. This
was the good roads resolution. This,
with the land tenantry and tax class
ification, are the three amendments
which will be submitted at the elec
tion of 1920. The good roads amend
ment is not all that was demanded by
the people. It does not allow the
state to build roads as was expected
but reads:

"The state shall never be a party
in carrying on any works of internal
improvement except to aid in the
construction of highways and the re
imbursement for the cost of perman
ent improvements of highways, con
structed after March 1, 1919, but
such aid and reimbursement shall not
be granted in any county in which no
more than 25 per cent of the cost of any
road or highway, nor for more than
$10,000 per mile, nor for more than
100 miles in any one county, except
that in counties having an assessed
valuation for more than $100,000,000
such aid and reimbursement may be
granted for not more than 150 miles
of road or highway; and the restrict
ions and limitations of sections 6 and
0 of article XI of the constitution, re
lating to debts and internal improve
ments, shall not be construed to limit
the authority retained or conferred by
this amendment."

TERMS TO HUNS
SOFTENED SOME

(Associated Press
London, March 10. There is a
strong feeling in political and diplo
matic circles in Paris in favor of in
viting Herbert Asquith, former Brit
ish premier, to become the first presi
dent of the League of Nations, ac
cording to the Daily Mirror.

Paris, March 19. Inclusion of the
League of Nations covenant in the
preliminary peace treaty will not de
lay signing the treaty which it is
hoped will be accomplished within
two weeks, said Lord Robert Cecil to
British and American correspondents
today. He said three amendments to
the covenant have been submitted,
but added that he was "sure there
will be no difficulty in meeting all
legitimate objections."

FIXING UP THE
TREATY'S TERMS:

Paris, March 18. President Wil
son is holding an important confer
ence with Premiers Lloyd George, Or
lando and Clemenceau at his Paris
white house today. This meeting
takes the place of the session of the
supreme council, which was post
poned until tomorrow. The question
to be discussed is the large one of se
curing accord between the great
powers on all phases of peace treaty
and its early presentation to the Ger
mans. It is expected that an agree
ment will be reached as to the in
clusion of a League of Nations as an
integral part of the treaty in accord
ance with a resolution which already
has been adopted by the conference.
