JOHN DEERE MOWERS

L

Easy Cutting interests every man who is going to buy a mower. Power
at the Knife is what is wanted. The Dain Vertical Lift Mower has
strong cutting qualities because of the economical transmission of power
from the drive wheels. It is a well known fact that any pair of gears
working together has a tendency to push out of mesh. The heavier the
work the greater the tendency. By setting the gears on the Dain so
this thrust action of one pair opposes that of the other, the thrust is
neutralized. The gears always run true and free on the bearings. Each
gear keeps the other in mesh and running on the correct pitch line.
Thereby making the mower easy of draft and a powerful cutter. We
sell it under a very strong Guarantee as to its cutting qualities, and dur
ability. We would be pleased to have you call and look it over.
