Millions more starving to death in cold

Many Die From Disease
For Countries Of Plenty Fear
Death From Famine Land
BY DR. FRIDTJOF NANSEN
Explorer and Russian Relief
Specialist, Who Recently Returned
From the Famine-Stricken Volga
Region to England.
In an Interview in London With
J. H. Bronner, Correspondent
of NEA Service.)
LONDON, Feb. 16.—To come back
from the lands of plenty after being
in famine-stricken Russia is like wak
ing from a terrible nightmare.
The American people have been
generous and prompt in aiding the
famine sufferers; but they
cannot fully visualize the extent of
the calamity.
The lands along the great River
where famine followed
floods have an area and popula-
tion approximately equal to that of
France.
For these people the great number
of millions is directly menaced
by death and millions—no matter
how frantic our efforts, we make now—
are doomed to die.
Every time the clock ticks dozens
of wasted skeletons, that were once
men and women and children, are
toppling over dead.
More Desolate Than Arctic
I am telling you what I have seen.
When you enter the famine lands of
Russia you enter the lands of ter
rible silence. The very birds have
fled this country of hunger. It
gives a greater sense of desolation
than the Arctic ice fields.
Many of the hamlets have lost
two-thirds of their population. And
those who survive—in rage, in filth
and starving, freezing, all hope gone,
conserving as best they may the
precious spark of life, can look for
nothing but one thing—the release
that death brings.
In Buzuluk I saw a pile of stiff
frozen corpses lying in the cemetery
waiting burial. The weary grave
digger said to me they came by cart
full every day. They were picked
up in the streets and alleys. They
were found in hallways. Sometimes
they were found in hovels, where
every one in the family had suc-
cumbed. What Donations Are Doing
Every American dollar, every Eng-
lish pound sterling, every French
franc now in supplying food,
farm implements to
the Volga is fighting three things:
FIRST—The terrible famine of to
day.
SECOND—The chances of an even
worse famine in the next win-
ter.
THIRD—The plagues of disease
that arise in the Volga country
and sweep across into happier
lands and America, decimating by
the thousands. And typhus and cholera have
already made their appearance in
the Volga country.
The poor people can't help being
dirty. They have no soap, no dis-
infectants, no drugs. And filth and
disease together are prolific breeders
of plagues.
Experience has shown that you
cannot successfully build a wall
against epidemics. They can't be
unfilled to their points of origin
and they sweep past frontier lines.
World May Reap Disease
If the people of the world are cold
and callous to the sufferings of starv-
ing men in Russia this winter, they may
reap a terrible harvest of disease and
death in their own homes next sum-
mer and fall.
Four months ago I begged the
civilized nations of the world repre-
sented by the Assembly of the
League of Nations to do something.
Millions have died because my ap-
peal fell on deaf ears.
The chances of helping the sur-
vivors have become less since then.
The Volga and other river ways are
frozen. The Russian railways
are hampered by snows.
In spite of these handicaps we
can do much if we do it promptly.
We must send grain to keep the
people alive and we must send seed,
and tools so that the survivors
can do their sowing in the
spring. Must Be Put On Feet
If we do this, the great grain
fields of Russia will become a depopu-
lated waste. Russia cannot re-
build until the Volga
region is saved.

MUSCLE SHOALS
Tennessee River Chairman Says
Project Is Too Big For 50-
Year Period
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16—(By As
sociated Press.) Inspection of the
government properties at Muscle
Shoals by members of the house mili
tary committee investigating the
Ford offer appeared probable today
in the event the members of the sen
ate agriculture committee, also con
sidering the Ford proposal, decide to
make a personal investigation.
The house committee today called
J. W. Worthington, who explained he
would make a statement as chairman
of the executive committee of the
Tennessee River Improvement asso
ciation and not as Henry Ford’s rep
resentative. He declared Muscle
Shoals was “100 immense” to be de
veloped in a hundred years and that
the possibilities there “clear out of a
fifty year period.”
SELF-SERVICE FLOOR
FOR CHURCHWELL STORE
WAYCROSS, Feb. 16.—The most
novel method of department store
salesmanship ever tried in Waycross
was inaugurated here Wednesday by
Churchwell Bros., a local concern.
The entire third floor of the building
occupied by the firm has been turn
ed into a self-service store and bar
gains from every part of the store
were placed on sale. The idea is
similar to the self-service grocery
store plan and demands the attention
of but one clerk and a cashier. The
floor was crowded on the opening
day.
OIL STOCK AND MONEY
OF TAYLOR MISSING
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16.—Oil
stock and money believed to have
constituted part of the estate of
William Desmond Taylor, murdered
film director, are missing, according
to Charles Jones, investigator for
the district attorney, after checking
up Taylor’s belongings.
DOTHAN WHOLESALER
IS KILLED BY AUTO
THOMASVILLE, Feb. 16.—W. F.
Newton, a prominent wholesale gro
cer of Dothan, Ala., was killed when
his car overturned on the Lone Star
Trail near Thomasville today. His
wife escaped with slight injuries.
To act promptly, but it is also good
business, it is good politics, and it
is a matter of self-protection against
epidemics of disease.
Every kind of distrust of our
work has been created by the spread
ing of shameless lies.
Lies were invented about my
agreement with the Soviet govern
ment, about the looting of relief
trains, about how the Soviets re
sponded to our efforts.
By hampering our work these lies
have meant the death of millions.
I should like to meet the men re
sponsible for those lies. I should
like to take them to the Volga, to
show them the wailing children, the
trembling mothers, the dead and the
dying—worse than any battlefield.
I think I would leave upon their
minds a lasting impression.

Congressman Longworth So Re

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.—The
enactment of a sales tax as the only
practicable means of raising money
for the proposed soldiers bonus was
stated to be the view of President
Harding by Representative Nicholas
Longworth, of Ohio, after a call to
day at the White House. He did not
say whether that view would be set
forth by the president in his coming
letter to the members of the finan
cial committees of congress.
Such an executive view was also
reflected by Senator Frelinghuysen,
of New Jersey, who called at the
White House while the president’s
letter was in the course of prepara
tion.

of his conferences with government

FIVE PRISONERS
POUND WAY OUT
OF COUNTY JAIL
Only One, Held For Murder, Who
Couldn’t Get Through Hole,
Remains
While they sang to drown the noise
of their operations, and a stiff breeze
was blowing up from the northwest,
carrying all sound away from the
living quarters of the county jail,
five negro prisoners twisted, pried
and pounded their way to freedom at
dusk last evening. Every man con
fined in the jail, including one accus
ed of murder, except one murderer who
was unable to get his body through
the small hole cut in a cell wall, escaped.
They were Wade Munroe, charged
with murder; Badger Bird, held for
assault with intent to murder; Son
Dorsey, 14 years old, held for burg
lary; Bill Savers, accused of cheating
and swindling and Jim Henry
Milner, confessed Americus store
burglar, who was wounded on the
night of January 19 by Policeman
Ross as he was fleeing after attempt
ing to start a car standing in front
of the Rylander theater. He had
completely recovered from his wound.
The sole occupant of the jail re
maining is Clyde Kemp, who killed
another negro on Calvin Carter's
place last December. None of them
had been tried.
Five of the six prisoners were con
fined in the “bull pen” on the lower
floor of the jail, Sheriff Harvey in
his kindness to them not consider
ing it necessary to keep them lock
ed in cells. Son Dorsey, just a boy,
was allowed in the outside corridor to keep up fires. That
he employed his time also in assist
ing in the escape was indicated by
smoke and soot on the outside of the
steel cell bars which had been cut, fire
from the stove evidently having been
employed to soften the steel for cut
ting. A saw evidently had been used
in the operation, but it was not
found.
Pound Out Bricks.
After gaining the main corridor,
the prisoners pounded out a section
of the brick wall about a rear win
dow, breaking up several steel cots
and tearing a huge lever off the lock
ing system.
The escape was not discovered un
til about 6 o’clock when Sheriff
Harvey came into the jail and Kemp
told him what had taken place. Kemp
insisted he had been calling for half
an hour but could make no one hear
him. Mrs. Harvey was about the
place all evening. At 5:30 she said
she milked the family cow in the rear
of the jail and heard nothing in the
jail but loud singing. Later from
her kitchen she heard the dull thump
ing against the brick wall, but be
cause of the breeze thought nothing
of it, supposing it to be a loose fence
board or something of the kind
swinging in the wind.
This morning Sheriff Harvey ask
ed Kemp why he didn't escape also.
The negro replied he did not want to
go, because he was already in trou
ble enough. The sheriff told him
he didn’t go because he couldn’t get
through the hole, according to his be
lief. The negro replied he thought
he could get through it, but when he
tried failed. Clerk H. E. Allen, who
was present, suggested that he try
in a different way, putting his hands
through first, and he was able to
squeeze through. Apparently, he had
been unable to make it the others,
as suspected.
Tells Two Stories.
Asked about how the others open
ed the bars, he told conflicting,
stories. To the sheriff he said they
had done the job quickly last eve
ning. To a reporter later he said
they had been “squatting around that
place” for a week or two, but that
he was in another part of the pen
and didn’t see or know what they
were doing.
The place where the cell bars were
cut is located on the north side of
the jail, near a window. It is said
the prisoners often hang blankets up
on the outside of the cells there to
keep the wind out, and this practice
is believed to have been responsible
for Sheriff Harvey not seeing the
evidence of their work as it progress
ed. He has been accustomed to visit
the cell room three times daily.
MORE TRUCK GROWERS
ORGANIZE IN CRISP
CORDELE, Feb. 16.—Farmers at
Arabi formed a truck growers asso
ciation Wednesday. This puts the
co-operative truck growing idea pret
ty well on the map in Crisp county.
It was agreed that all communities
over the county should plant at the
same time and co-operate so as to
have quantities of marketable stuff
ready.

YOU AND I?
L. L. LUMMUS, EDITOR
RECOMMEND? FUNERAL
MUSIC AS THE KIND THAT
SHOULD BE PLAYED AT
SOME WEDDINGS.
Does the sentimental song, such
as “Oh, Promise Me,” detract
from the solemnity and sanctity of
marriage ceremonies?
Does light music contribute to
ward the taking of marriage vows
lightly, thus smoothing the path
way for easy divorce?
Bishop Ernest V. Shaylor, of the
Nebraska Episcopal thinks
so. He puts a ban on sentimental
songs at weddings.
There'd be strange and varied
melody at marriages if prophetic
clairvoyants could select their music.
Much jazz. Often a funeral dirge.
More often, the old song, "I Don’t
Know Where I’m Going, But I’m On
My Way."
Bishop Shaylor is on the right
track. Few brides and bridegrooms
realize the solemnity, importance
and responsibilities of sacred mar
riage. The bishop does.
GAS
Grandpa also cursed the gas bills.
In 1847 the Louisville Gas company’s
rate was $3.50 a thousand cubic feet.
A 5 per cent discount, if paid within
three days.
In those days gas was used only
for lighting.
Discovery of great fields of nat
ural gas and extension of its use to
millions of households have lowered
the price.
Everything wasn’t cheap in “the
good old days.”
RATTLERS
Price of live rattlesnakes has fal
len to 8 cents a pound. This causes
gloom in the “rattler” district around
Brownsville, Tex.
“Rattlesnake” King, leading deal
er, has 100,000 snakes in stock. Like
far-off manufacturers and retailers,
he is burning midnight oil, figuring
depreciation in inventories.
Diamonds slump in Kimberley,
elephants in Siam.
Business depression hit everyone.
Break the mainspring, whole watch
stops. Individuals and businesses
are as interdependent as parts of a
watch. Co-operation always is ad-
visable, for selfish reasons.
STATES
Cash bonuses, totaling $191,339,
00, are being paid to war veterans
by 13 states. Additional $156,500,
000 will be paid under legislation
already passed.
Sometimes Americans forget that
their country is a league of 48 coun
tries (states), some of them individ
ually as powerful and important as
nations like Belgium.
Too often, the state neglects its
duty, passes the buck to slow mov
ing Uncle Sam. Not so, in some states,
with adjusted compensation for vet
erans.
In many other public problems
the states should act without waiting
on Washington. Farm relief and
unemployment, for instance.

NAMES OF SEVEN
MEN WANTED IN
CASE REPORTED
Five Of Them Are Related.
Three Being Brothers—Feeling Subsiding
Word from Ellaville today was that
no arrests had yet been made on the
nine warrants charging murder taken
out Tuesday night at the direction of
the coroner’s jury following an in
vestigation into the shooting to death
Monday by a mob of Will Jones.
Jones, a respected negro farmer, was
found dying following the wounding
Sunday night by him of Henry Har
vey and Bennie DeVane when they
called at his home and are alleged to
have fired at him when he attempted
to escape from them. Sheriff R. E.
Battle believes all have left the
county. Even Harvey, who was the
more seriously wounded of the two,
was not at his home when the sheriff
called there, and he is believed to
have been carried by friends or rela
tives outside the county.
From an unofficial but thoroughly
reliable source it was learned today
that warrants have been issued
against the following seven Schley
county men, in connection with the
affair:
BENNIE DEVANE,
JOHNNY DEVANE,
ARTHUR DEVANE,
HENRY HARVEY,
CLARENCE ROBINSON,
TOM BROWN,
GEORGE PHILLIPS.
Two unidentified soldiers, believed
to have been from Camp Benning,
are also accused under John Doe war
rants.
DeVanes Are Brothers.
The three DeVanes accused are
brothers. Bennie DeVane is one of
the two men wounded by the negro
Jones Sunday night, his hurts being
slight, and he is regarded as a leader
of the lynching party. Johnny De-
Vane is the husband of the young
woman who was accosted by the ne
gro Jones on the highway two
weeks before being asked to ride with him
in his buggy, an alleged innocent re
mark about this incident on the part
of Jones having resulted in his death,
according to popular report and be
lief.
Clarence Robinson is a brother-in
law of the DeVane brothers, having
married their sister, and lives in their
neighborhood in the Hopewell vicini
ty north of Ellaville. Tom Brown
is not a relative of the DeVanes
or Mr. Harvey, but resides in their
section, and is a well-to-do farmer.
George Phillips is a son of Rev. Har
dy Phillips, a well known and re
spected Primitive Baptist minister
living midway between Ellaville and
Oglethorpe. The son resides in the
Lowe neighborhood not far from the
Sumter county line near where the
shooting of Jones took place. His
mother, a highly respected aged lady,
died about two weeks ago. He is
not related to the DeVanes or Mr.
Harvey, it is understood.
Harvey Hardly In Mob
Just what led to the warrant be
ing drawn against Henry Harvey is
not known here, as it is certain that
the seriousness of his wounds from
the negro’s shotgun prevented him
from participating with the mob.
Whether all of the others were iden
tified by R. F. Allen, the chief wit
ness before the coroner's jury, as
members of the mob, also has not
been established. No official in
formation is yet to be had. Coroner
H. U. Rigsby stating that an agree
ment was had at the inquest not to
give out the names or the terms of
verdict until arrests had been ac
complished.
Sheriff Battle, who is a farmer
and devotes most of his time to his
farm, resides six miles south of Ella
ville, in the Friendship section, close
to the Sumter and Marion county
lines. This is a distance of at least
ten miles from the DeVane neighbor
hood, and considerable distance from
where the lynching of Jones occurred.
The tense feeling in Ellaville and
Schley county is reported to be sub
siding today, although it is declared
the community leaders and church
element are holding to their express
ed determination to see justice done
and the accused men brought to trial,
feeling that a cloud has been cast
on the good name of the community
which must be removed by stern ac
tion.
Drinking In Mob.
According to information that has
leaked out concerning developments
at the inquest, Benny DeVane acted
as spokesman for the lynchers, sev
eral of whom were drinking. The
two soldiers were picked up by the
lynchers, after Allen had been taken
from his home by the party, and
while the mob was on its way to seize
Jones. The names of these two men
have not yet become known, and it
is generally said that they joined the
mob.
