GREAT ACT BOOKED Phoenix

been widely discussed editorially by
Pacific coast publications. This feat
ure has just been booked for the
Columbia theater, opening on Tues
day night, and the management of
that playhouse promises that it will
prove little short of a sensation.

CATHOLIC AUTHOR IN TOWN
An author well known in Catholic
circles and a character in himself,
is in the town in the person of John
Patrick Harrigan. Mr. Harrigan is
the author of a number of books
and articles on Catholicism, and is
considered an authority on early
Catholic history in the southwest.
His mission here in Southern Ari
zona is to study from a religious
standpoint the Maricopa and Pima
Indians, who are strong for the
Catholic faith.

HELD FOR MURDEROUS AS
SAULT Julia Lawlor, who was ar
rested about a month ago for carv
ing the face of Mrs. Martha Wood,
the proprietress of the Polk street
lodging house, with a particularly
dull razor, was given a preliminary
examination before Justice Parker
yesterday. The fact of the assault
was brought out and there was some
testimony on the part of the state
as to the good character of the
prosecuting witness; or, rather, it
was brought out that the witnesses
knew nothing against her character.
The defense waived examination and
the defendant was held in the sum
of $500. Bail was furnished.

TAX RATE WILL
BE NEAR LIMIT

With Total Assessable Val
uation of $27,194,700.66
and $271,949.70 to Raise,
Assessments Will Be
High

Some interesting facts are brought
out in the proposed budget present
ed by the city auditor to the com
mission for consideration yesterday
morning. In the first place the total
assessed valuation is placed at $28,
949,681.65 with exemptions of $1,754,
980.89 for a total assessable valua
tion of $27,194,700.66. The budget
shows that it will be necessary to
make available for the city expenses
$482,338.85 with estimated receipts of
$210,389.15, leaving a total to raise
by taxation of $271,949.70. This
means that the probable rate of tax
ation will be fixed by the commis
sion at nearly if not quite $1.00 per
$100 valuation.

The changes in the old Savoy the
atre have all been made and every
thing is in readiness for the opening
of the rehabilitated show house this
evening under the management of
Harry Nace, and showing for the
opening bill the wonderful Vitagraph
six-reel feature, “Captain Alvarez,”
with dashing Edith Storey in the
leading female role. Those who have
seen and appreciated the wonderful
emotional acting of Miss “Billie”
Storey will welcome her return to
the pictures available for Phoenix
movie fans with a great deal of
pleasure.
This is absolutely the first time
“Captain Alvarez” has been shown in
Arizona. It is a wonderful picture
and has been used exclusively by the
Vitagraph company in their own
houses in the large cities of the
north and east, and has made a
great killing.

In order that there might be no
mistake Manager Nace insisted on a
trial of all the appliances to see that
everything is in good shape for the
opening. The light was tried out
and proved excellent. The new
heavy curtain, which acts as a
sounding board also for the famous
Wurlitzer orchestra, was lowered and
the bearings tested and everything
found O.K. The projector was
found to be 100 per cent correct,
and the fans made the proper amount
of air stirrings to keep the place
cool. All equipment was pronounced
passed by the board of censorship.
After that another concert was
rendered by Fred Martin on the
wonderful musical instrument that
beats any band or orchestra in the
country and the doors were closed
to be opened tonight with a blaze of
light.

OPEN CANYON ROADS The
board of trade yesterday wrote Rep
resentative Carl Hayden urging the
speedy opening of the roads about
the rim of the Grand Canyon to auto
traffic. The success of the Yosemite
tours since the opening of that val
ley to the motorist was cited.
