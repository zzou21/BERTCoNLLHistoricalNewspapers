PHOENIX, ARIZONA, JULY 16, 1909.
The Association of American
Advertisers (New York City) has
examined and certified to the circulation
of this publication. Only the figures of
circulation contained in its report are
guaranteed by the Association.
The Republican is the only newspaper
in Arizona holding two certificates of
circulation from the above Association,
and bases all advertising contracts
thereon. The average circulation, per
day, thus certified to is:
From Oct. 1, 1906, to March 31,
1907 6236
From Jan. 1, 1908, to Feb. 8,
1909 6434
These figures represent a larger circu
lation than that of all other Phoenix
dailies combined, and is the largest in
Arizona by more than 2000. The Re
publican is the only Arizona newspaper
that makes public its circulation as cer
tified to by the Association of American
Advertisers, which is the only recognized
authority in the United States.
EFFORT SHOULD BE UNRELAXED.
Though there is a division of senti
ment on a majority of questions
which are presented in Phoenix, there
is one on which all are agreed—the
need of the completion of the through
line. We all look forward with more
or less confidence to the time when
Phoenix shall be a town of 50,000, yet
we must face the fact that it will
never have such a population until it
becomes a point on a main line.
Nothing will so stimulate the growth
of the city as a through line. We
believe no one will contradict any of
the propositions herein laid down.
We have heard much encouraging
news of the intention of the Southern
Pacific to carry on its share of the
work at an early date, but this news
is not traced to any authoritative
source but is based upon the presence
of surveyors along the proposed line.
But surveyors are always in the field.
We hope that the signs which have
inspired all these reports are true,
for the completion of that line is a
duty which the Southern Pacific as
sumed and must somehow be dis
charged. It became a duty when the
Southern Pacific took over the Phoe
nix & Eastern, for long before this we
would have had a through line if the
operations of the Santa Fe had not
been obstructed, first by injunction
at the instance of the Southern Pa
cific, and later by stubborn litigation
in the interior department. Then
came the enforced transfer.
We have shown that there are rea
sons why the Southern Pacific may
not find it to its interest to construct
the necessary link; that is, at the
present time. There are outside influ
ences endeavoring to compel the con
struction, and it has become the duty
of every loyal citizen of Phoenix and
the valley to strengthen those influ
ences.
Here is work, as we stated some
time ago, for the board of trade,
which is representative of every inter
est of the valley, and which has been
charged with the duty of securing for
the valley those things which it needs
to make it greater.
A constant hammering at the matter
can not fail to be productive of re
sults. The essential thing now is to get
the extension of the Phoenix & East
ern started. In the meantime, we have
the most positive assurance of the
beginning of work in the fall, as soon
as work can be carried on advantage
ously, on the Arizona & California.
That short link will be completed
within six months after the beginning
of operations at the other end of the
million dollar bridge at Parker.
There is still other work for Phoe
nix to do—to urge and encourage the
construction of the Buckeye railroad,
which, in time, may develop into a
link of another through line, an out
let from Phoenix to the southwest, as
the A. & C. will be an outlet to the
northwest.
Though this is a season of the year
in which effort is not especially in
spired, there is no time of the year
in which effort should not be put
forth in behalf of Phoenix and the
Salt River Valley.
Kansas City, Kas., is to have the
commission form of government. Per
haps, after all, that will be found to
be better than none at all, the kind
the Kansas City, Kansans, have been
used to.
It was not a good night at Los
Angeles on Wednesday night for Illi
nois Thunderbolts.

In our religious perusal of the
Congressional Record we find that
most of the speeches on the tariff
bill were made by the democrats and
"progressive" republicans. The flood
of oratory was offset by the superior
voting capacity of the other side. It
is always that way. The party with
the votes sees little need of taxing
its lung power. Oratory is out of
date. It is entirely improbable that
all the wind jamming changed a
single vote on a single schedule.

We do not like to be surpassed in
admiration for Harry McLean, but we
can not quite accept the suggestion
which comes from Los Angeles that
the new state should be named after
him.
The weather bureau is making
praiseworthy efforts in reaching out
after the mid-summer record, but we
fear that it will fall short of the 118
degrees in the shade attained two
years ago.
The eyes of the country are fixed
upon the tariff conference, lest the
conferees take radium off of the free
list.

SUGGESTED REFORMS.
To The Republican:
I haven't seen much talk in your pa
per lately about closing the saloons.
I guess it is so hot that they all want
their beer. Say, can't you scare up a
humane society that will look into the
way stock is driven on the Mesa and
Roosevelt road. It doesn't seem reason
able but it is a fact that horses are
sometimes driven until they drop
dead for want of water. I am on the
road with a big team and I know.
The little freighters make the trip in
much shorter time than it takes the
Shattuck-Kimmo company, Anderson
and others.
The horses are generally sore-shouldered,
have lame backs and are badly
bruised. This matter ought to be put
into the hands of some good man.

If so, you'll need a Suit Case. We
believe you can get a better bargain
here than elsewhere, because we have
put low prices on our Suit Cases. We
want to close them out.
In our little store we haven't room

Therefore, if you need one, get it
here at a bargain. Our cases were
made by M. C. Lilly & Co., Colum

You can depend on these cases for

and appearance.

"He Seen His

From a grammatical standpoint
this is something fierce isn't
it?
No worse in a sense than
the man who puts up a house,
store or factory, and who, to
save a few dollars, contents
himself by installing cheap but
poor plumbing.
Far fetched comparison? Not
a bit of it! Both have made
inexcusable errors.
