REPUBLICAN A. P. LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, Feb. 18. Rails led another,
advance of prices on the stock
exchange today, speculative issues embracing the recently reorganized roads
making relatively greater gains than
the investment division.
Increasing recognition of the changes
which are to come over the country's
transportation systems on their return
to private operation and favorable aspects of federal legislation constituted
impelling causes of the movement.
As for investment or gilt-edged rails,
traders seemed suddenly to reach the
belief that they had been selling "out
of line" or far below quotations justified by their intrinsic or physical values.
Gross gains of one to nearly five
points amended the steady accumulation of Pacifics, grangers, coalers and
eastern trunk lines, but cotton carriers
made more moderate improvement.
There were substantial advances also
in many industrials and which featured the acute depression of the two
preceding days. Rallies of three to 12
points in such issues as crucible steel,
General Motors, oils, equipments and
shippings were effected at the expense
of an overconfident short interest,
but these were reduced by realizing
sales before the close. Sales amounted
to 925,000 shares.
Speculative or convertible rails in
the bond market kept pace with the
demand for kindred shares. Liberty issues reacted slightly with steadiness
in internationals. Sales, par value,
were $11,375,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
