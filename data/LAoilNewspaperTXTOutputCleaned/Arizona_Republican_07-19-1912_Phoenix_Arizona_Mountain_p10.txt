HUGE
FIND
OF
SERVICE

Seeks Water, Finds Ma
terial for Philanthropic
Dream; Madison Folk
Favor City Market for
Produce Clearing House
MADISON DISTRICT One of the
most important of recent discoveries,
ranking only second to Cook’s “inven
tion” of the north pole is Hiram Smith’s
finding water within twelve feet of
the surface at Squaw Peak. Mr. Smith
made this discovery a short time ago
and if Mr. Smith is successful with his
plans he is making, the homesteaders
in Paradise valley can feel indepen
dent; for he says with a little work
the entire valley on the north side of
the mountain range known as the
Phoenix mountains can be irrigated
with clear well water at a cost much
less than the people in this valley must
pay. Another advantage of this system
of irrigating is the fact that a pipe line
is needed to carry water from the well.
The pipe will prevent weeds from
spreading as there will be no chance
for seeds to fall in the water and be
spread on the land. Mr. Smith also
says he expects to build a sanitarium at
the head of the line and make it a
charity institution which will not only
be a benefit to the sick but a help to
the farmers who can get the highest
prices for their produce at this place.
Full details and descriptions will be
published as soon as Mr. Smith thinks
he has this benevolent scheme mapped
out. Many are already offering to do
anything that will help him with this
glorious enterprise. W. I. Brooks being
the principal man in this movement,
will get a good position.
Those from this district who patron
ize the city market will be surprised to
hear that more sheds will be built as
soon as arrangements can be made.
The Arizona Producers association will
also build a large warehouse on the
east side of the block. In a little over
two months of its life this market has
sent out over eighty-five car loads of
produce at prices much higher and with
better results than the old way by
which commission merchants got most
of the profits. The melons are coming
very fast and are being shipped out at
the rate of three to eight carloads per day.
Cantaloupes are also coming in rapid
ly; many are being bought for pick
ling. Peaches are coming in slowly.
The apricots are falling off almost to
nothing. Valley strawberries are go
ing up. Many are beginning to come in
from California to supply home trade.
The reclamation service is cleaning
ditches in this section. These ditches
have become so full of weeds and dirt
that it has been almost impossible to
run water through them lately.
The most pleasing of all news that
can reach the ears of the people of this
district is the fact that the Phoenix
Railway company will soon have two
of the best and most up-to-date inter
urban cars on the Glendale line. The
cars will have cushion seats with air
brakes and a special feature will be the
doors, which will be in the middle of
the car instead of the end. The old
cars now running on this line will be
put on the Indian school line where a
ten-minute service will be inaugurated.
This with the five cent fare will make
this line one to be proud of instead of
being classed as an old time curio.
The Creed Bros. threshing machine
has been changed to an alfalfa seed
huller and will move to the Buckeye
valley to comply with contracts taken
there. This machine is one of the
best in the valley and is always kept
busy.
The sermon delivered at the school
house last Sunday was heard by a
good sized audience. Rev. W. I. Brooks
conducting the services. There will be
a preaching at this place every Sunday
evening and all are cordially invited to
attend.
Waldo Welty has been given charge
of the fields of alfalfa at the Bethany
Home sanitarium and is putting them
in first-class shape. Welty is doing
some experiments on the progressive
farming line.
Charles Watt arrived from Lancas
ter, Pa., after a short visit with friends
in his home state. Mr. Watt says the
heat is becoming unbearable in the east
and he thinks Salt River valley is a
summer resort compared with Penn.
The grapes of this district are be
ginning to ripen very fast and the pric
es are still good considering the amount
of grapes that are being put on the
market.
Mrs. Robert Hunter who has under
gone an operation at the Sisters’ hospi
tal in Phoenix is recovering
rapidly
and will be able to be out again in a
few days.
T. T. Fleming narrowly escaped a
runaway when the horse which he was
driving became frightened at a flock
of sheep. Mr. Fleming finally got the
horse under control.
Some hay was ruined by the rain but,
as a rule the farmers seem satisfied
with it. They say it done more good
than damage.
The Missionary church association is
still in session as to the person who
the superintendency of the Bethany
Home should be awarded.
It was hoped by many of the far
mers that after the congressional
committee investigation the reclama
tion service would be improved, but
there seems to be no material change.
One of the prominent farmers of
this section said that the ditch clean
ers only work about one-third of the
eight-hour day. He said at times
their camp is three and four miles
from their work and they make this
drive twice a day. By letting the
horses walk as they generally do, it
takes four hours to make two round
trips, thus leaving only four hours
to work. With much of this time
spent in talk and shovel filing, the
work cannot be done satisfactorily.
o
MORE TRUTH THAN FICTION.
O. U. Hibrow, M. A., D. C. L., B. and
O. C. H. and D., &c. Professor of Jour
nalism in the University of Woof, made
his way into the den of the Exchange
editor, while on his tour of inspection.
"My, what a dirty place!" exclaimed
the professor. "Why, the floor is lit
tered with stuff. Surely you are not a
journalist?"
"No," replied the E. E. "Merely a
newspaper man."
"Ah, you mean you handle newspap
ers?" said the professor, as he dug for
his note book. "Quite interesting, don't
you know."
"And what is your favorite news
paper?" asked the professor.
"The Congressional Record," replied
the E. E., as he jammed his hand into
the paste pot.
"But why the Congressional Record?"
asked the professor.
"’Cause I don't have to read it," re
plied the E. E.
"Extraordinary!" exclaimed the pro
fessor, as he made his exit.
