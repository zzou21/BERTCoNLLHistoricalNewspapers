HOME FROM AN

EASTERN TRIP
Miss Gilchrist Spent Profitable Vacation in Studying
Charities and Correction
Work in Chicago, Cleveland and Indianapolis
Miss Chrissie Gilchrist, the directing
spirit in the work of the Associated
Charities in this city, has returned
from a busy vacation or outing trip
of about five weeks in the east.
Though nearly all her time was de
voted to a study of matters in line
with her work and it kept her busy, it
was nevertheless relaxation and recreation
and she returns feeling much
better for the diversion.
Her objective point when she left
was Cleveland where she went to at
tend the annual conference of the Na
tional Association of Charities and
Corrections as the representative of
Mayor Christy and the county board
of supervisors. It was a very inter
esting and enlightening convention
and she learned a great deal that will
be helpful in her work here.
Subsequently she made a study of
the public institutions, charity organ
izations and other things pertaining to
work of the nature she is engaged in,
in Cleveland, Indianapolis and Chi
cago. This was very illuminating and
interesting. She says that she found
better organization and greater effi
ciency in Indianapolis. Cleveland was
next and Chicago the most loosely
handled of the three places.
This condition she says is no reflec
tion on the managers of the work in
the two larger cities but is due solely
to their greater population. The
smaller the town the better the organ-
ization, the greater the acquaintance
and co-operation between the personnel
of the managers and the closer the
check kept on the operations of the
many employed in a subordinate ca
pacity. The charity workers in the
big cities are as capable and consci
entious as anywhere but they have a
more cumbersome machine and the
nature of it is such that it can be
more easily taken advantage of by
evil disposed persons. That it is
sometimes taken advantage of even in
so small a place as Phoenix is unfor
tunately true.
On her way home Miss Gilchrist
stopped in Kahoka, Mo., where she
visited with the parents of Miss Gertrude Trump, whose
acquaintance she formed when they
visited Phoenix, and with Trump's sister, Mrs. Merritt of
New Jersey, who was also here for a
time.

LOS ANGELES WAITER
Recognized as Man Who Took Part in
Jail Break at Nome.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
LOS ANGELES, July 29. Charged
with having broken jail after having
been convicted of robbery at Nome,
Alaska, in 1901, James Landers was
arrested by the federal authorities here
today and was lodged in the county
jail pending the arrival of an Alaskan
officer. Landers was taken into cus
tody at a restaurant where he was
working as waiter.
He was seen there several days ago
by Frank Patton a resident of Los
Angeles who was in Nome at the time
of the jailbreak and who declared that
he recognized Landers as a convict.
Patton notified the government offi
cials who communicated with the
Alaskan authorities who in turn asked
that Landers be arrested.
Landers is said to have taken part
in a jailbreak which resulted in kil
ling three convicts. Nine were cap
tured.

Wolgast Raising Price for Fight With
McFarland.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
CHICAGO, July 23. Wolgast's de
mands for meeting Packy McFarland
for ten rounds in New York are go
ing up. Before leaving for Cadillac,
he told McFarland's manager that
he would fight the stock yards man
at 135 pounds, 2 o'clock, either on
September 20 or 27 for $22,500.
A few days ago Wolgast said he
would fight for $20,000. Last night
at one time he said a purse of $15,
000 would do. He agreed today to
waive the picture rights if given
$22,500.

APPEAL TO THE

REFERENDUM

Railroads Throughout the
State Yesterday Began
the Circulation of Peti
tions for Submission of
Five New Laws to People
The railroads of the state have de
cided to secure if possible an expres
sion of the sentiment of the voters of
the state in respect of the five laws
passed by the legislature affecting rail
road operation. They desire that the
five laws in question shall be submit
ted to a referendum of the people at
the next election and if they endorse
the legislation well and good; other
wise it will drop into the waste bas
ket. With that object in view representa
tives of the railroads all over the
state, yesterday took the field, each
armed with five petitions, one for
each law. To get action they will
have to secure enough signatures to
equal five per cent of the votes cast
for governor at the last election and
the petitions must be filed with the
secretary of state within ninety days
after the adjournment of the legisla
ture. The laws in question are as follows:
The law requiring electric headlights
on all locomotives; the law requiring
the employment of experienced men
only in train service, providing that all
engineers must have served three
years as firemen and all conductors
three years as brakemen; the act fix
ing the number of men in crews of
trains and engines when running
alone; the law prohibiting a change of
more than three cents a mile railroad
fare; and the law requiring a semi-
monthly payday.
There is no secrecy about the move
ment. In fact, the railroad men are
rather anxious for publicity believing
that they can easily secure the sig
natures wanted and desiring to finish
up the business as expeditiously as
possible.
o
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
The electric light service was more or less
out last night for an hour or so due
to the interference of the lightning
with the transmission line from Roose
velt. The line was struck by light
ning several times and the light was
eliminated for a moment. One side of the
line finally went out entirely but the
other was in good service at a late
hour this morning and still supplied
the city with juice.

SUGAR FRAUDS SETTLED
Criminal Companies Give Up Quarter
of Million Dollars.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
WASHINGTON, July 23. The al
leged sugar frauds at Philadelphia un
der investigation by Secretary of the
Treasury MacVeagh and Attorney
General Wickersham for the last year
have been settled by the payment of
nearly a quarter of a million dollars
to the United States government by
the sugar refining companies involved.
This announcement was made by the
treasury department today.
o
AN ARMY CHANGE.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
WASHINGTON, July 29. Among
the army orders regarding the medical
corps issued today is one directing
Captain James I. Mabee to be relieved
of duty at Fort Huachuca, Arizona,
and proceed to the Letterman general
hospital for duty.

GETTING WITH THE
Getting Too Old to Wait on Pro
moters to Meet His Terms.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
CHICAGO, July 23. Jack Johnson,
the champion heavyweight pugilist
of the world announced tonight
that he had fought his last battle. "I
never drew on a glove as long as I
live," declared Johnson. "The
promoters won't give me my price
for fighting now and if I wait a
year probably I will not be in a condition
to put up a fight worthy of a champion.
So it's good bye to Johnson as Johnson the champion of the world."
Johnson said he would not
retire in favor of any fighter. "Let
Jeannette, McVey and Langford fight
it out. I think McVey can thrash any
of them but that is their trouble,
not mine. No white fighter can give
either of these a good battle."
Johnson has saved his money. He
said tonight that he is worth $200,000,
the greater portion of it well
invested.

Had a Delightful Outing of
Five Weeks and Met
Many Old Friends; City
Is Dull But Preparing for
Big Business

J. J. Sweeney, assistant cashier of
the National Bank of Arizona returned
yesterday morning from a vacation of
five weeks on the coast most of which
time was spent in San Francisco where
his family remains for the present.
That city was Mr. Sweeney's boyhood
home and he has not visited it before
for about ten years, except for just a
day at a time on business. This time
he looked around thoroughly and re
newed old acquaintance with boyhood
scenes as well as the friendships of
other years.
He was there when the Elks went
through and the Arizona commission
selected the site for the Arizona build
ing so of course he saw a host of home
folk. One man the older residents
here will be glad to hear from is Dr.
Kschman, a warm friend of Mr. Swee
ney for many years and who took a
deal of pleasure in showing him the
sights of the newer San Francisco.
Mr. Kschman formerly owned and con
ducted the drug store in the corner of
Center and Washington streets now
known as the Central but then known
as the Garden City. Mr. Kschman
moved from here to San Francisco
many years ago and established what
came to be known as the Snake drug
store, through the fact that its show
windows were filled with snakes of
many kinds, kept as an advertisement.
The Snake drug store together with
the snakes went up in the big fire and
Mr. Kschman lost a great deal of
money. He is again in business, how-
ever, and is doing well, retaining the
same name for his drug store, though
he has restocked his snakes.
Mr. Sweeney says San Francisco is
rather quiet in a business way and but
little has been done toward the big ex
position, that is little that is visible,
though a world of work has been ac
complished in the planning and preliminaries.
But the dullness is only
the lull before the storm and it will
surely be a lively place from this fall
forward until the big show is over.

PITIFUL TALE OF REFUGEES

have been built and irrigation systems
have been completed. The four
thousand settlers comprise between
700 and 800 families.
"A conservative estimate places the
average individual property of each
family, including improvements, wa
ter rights and stock at $10,000. Persons
familiar with conditions in the
colony say that to abandon the farms
means practically a complete loss as
buildings and fences will be de
stroyed, canals and ditches filled and
crops, now almost ready to be har
vested, will be lost or stolen, and
stores will be pillaged. The meeting
houses and other buildings of the
church in Mexico are said to be worth
$1 ir,i'00."

pleted a 148 days' trip around the

soon as the ship arrived here.

It Has Been Decided,
Though Not Yet Official
ly, Announced That the
Measure Cannot Be Sub
mitted to the Voters

The Kinney bill has gone by the
board. It will not be submitted to
the voters next November, though
the woman suffrage amendment will
be submitted. This statement has
not yet been officially made, but it
is nevertheless the fact.
The Kinney bill fails because of
the failure to secure the petition
from Swansea for filing within the
required time. Without the Swansea
petition the bill lacked thirty signa
tures. There were forty-five signa
tures attached to the Swansea docu
ment, but that was lost and has not,
so far as known, been found. Any
way, it has not been presented at the
office of the secretary of state.
It was thought by the friends of
the bill that the trouble might be
overcome by the presentation of af
fidavits, showing that the petition
contained the forty-five signatures,
and that they had been affixed with
in the required time. The attorney
general's office has decided, however,
that that may not be done.

"His distribution of offices, honors
and titles was made after a careful
comparison of the importance of the
services rendered. No one who knows
intimately the history of Japan in
recent years will deny to Mutsu Hito

WASHINGTON INFORMED.
WASHINGTON, July 29. The first
official news of the demise of the em
peror of Japan came to the state de
partment by cable from Ambassador
O'Brien at Tokio dated July 30, 2 a. m.,
reporting his death at 12:43 a. m. The
news was communicated to the White
House and President Taft cabled di
rectly his regrets to the empress dow
ager. To the new emperor he sent: "On
the sad occasion of the death of his
majesty, the Emperor Mutsu Hito,
our illustrious father, I offer to your
majesty my most profound sympathy
and that the government of the peo
ple of the United States. Accept my
good wishes for a long and prosperous
reign and continuance of the welfare
of the Japanese empire."
He also sent this message to the be
reaved empress dowager: "I beg your
majesty to accept the condolence and
sincerest sympathy of Mrs. Taft and
myself in the great loss which you
have sustained in the death of your
illustrious husband, for whom I en
tertained sentiments of the highest
personal esteem and regard."
A DELAYED CEREMONY
SAN FRANCISCO, July 29. Owing
to the emperor's death the ceremon
ies arranged for the selection of the
site of the Japanese building at the
Panama Pacific exposition, August,
were indefinitely postponed. President
Chas. G. Moore of the exposition ca
bled today to the American ambassa
dor at Tokio requesting him to ex
press to the Japanese government the
sorrow and sympathy of the exposi
tion management. Japanese and
American flags on the exposition
grounds were lowered to half mast.

LEWIS HOUSE
Property at Seventh and
Jefferson Street, Hotel
for Colored People, Practi
cally Destroyed at Early
Hour This Morning
About 1:20 o'clock this morning
fire broke out in the roof of a lodg
ing house on the corner of Seventh
and Jefferson streets, from some
cause that could not be learned last
night. Though rain was falling
heavily at the time and the fire de
partment worked assiduously, it
seemed almost impossible to quench
the blaze.
The building was constructed of
adobe, with a shingle roof. Probably
the walls will not be injured be
yond repair, but the roof is practi
cally destroyed, with much of the
contents of the house, though some
furniture was saved. The night was
dark and the streets surrounding
were muddy, as the location is be
yond the limits of the paved district,
and rain had been falling for several
hours.
The property belonged to John K.
Lewis, proprietor of the Fashion bar
bershop, who built it a year or so
ago for the express purpose of hav
ing a suitable public house for the
entertainment of the transient peo
ple of his race who found difficulty
in securing such accommodations in

Frisc Grand Jury Refuses to Take
Part in Family Affair.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 29. The
grand jury tonight refused to find
an indictment against Mrs. Caroline
Perkins, William Patterson and Pat
rick Walsh, who were arrested at
New York last Friday charged by
Nicholas J. McNamara, a retired
banker, with stealing his automobile.
McNamara said tonight he intended
to leave for New York by special
train tomorrow in the hope of reach
ing there before August 3, the date
set for the hearing.
The three prisoners were servants
of McNamara at a suburb of San
Francisco. They left with Mrs. Mc
Namara in an automobile and were
traced by a stream of checks drawn
by Mrs. McNamara on her bank ac
count here. McNamara charges that
Mrs. Perkins obtained an influence
over his wife which he cannot ex
plain. The first public notice of their
estrangement was an advertisement
published by Mrs. McNamara about
two months ago in which she warned
"to whom it may concern" that she
would not be further responsible for
her husband's debts. McNamara is
much more anxious to win back his
wife than to press charges against
the servants.

NEVADA REPUBLICANS
CHOOSE THREE ELECTORS
Situation Involved in Doubt by Pri
mary Law.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
RENO, July 29. Thomas Nelson of
Reno, W. W. Booth, of Tonopah and
William McGill of Ely were nominated
for republican presidential electors
from this state at the second state
convention, held here today. The nom
inations for electors were omitted at
the first convention of republicans be
cause it was thought that the new
primary law required such nomina
tions to be made at the September
primaries. To make sure, however, a
second convention was called to supply
the omission.
The progressive party convention re
cently nominated electors instead of
waiting for primaries and thus caused
apprehension lest no regular republi
can electors would be permitted on the
official ballot in November. The law
concerning nominations is still in
doubt and the supreme court has been
asked to give an interpretation of the
new primary law.

Hoarseness and often an aggravating cough, the stomach is affected,
resulting in dyspepsia, loss of appetite,
and gradually all the mucous membranes of the body
become diseased. Catarrh is beyond the reach of local
treatment. Only temporary relief can be had from the
use of sprays, washes, etc. S. S. S. cures Catarrh by
cleansing the blood of all impure catarrhal matter and
at the same time building up the entire system. Then
as pure, nourishing blood circulates through the body,
the inflamed membranes heal, all displacements cease and
