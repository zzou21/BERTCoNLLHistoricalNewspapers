o
A BICYCLE.
Is one of the most useful as well
as most inexpensive steeds on earth.
It does not have to be fed as a horse,
nor kept going with gasoline or elec
tricity. All that is necessary is a
well developed set of leg muscles,
the bicycle, and now and then a little
solution called "Do Good" sold by
Griswold, to stop a leaky tire, and
you are off for a Sunday in the
country.
o
IN NEW YORK CITY
You will find Hotel Cumberland,
at Broadway and Fifty-fourth street,
near Central Park, an ideal location.
In the retail shopping and theatre
district, with the subway, elevated
and surface cars at hand. A hands
ome, modern, beautifully furnished
hotel with one of the best restau
rants in the city, but moderate in
prices. Rooms with bath, $2.50 per
day up. Harry P. Stimson, manager.
o
A MEETING
of the Arizona Producers company
will be held at school house No. 31,
which is located at the junction of
Tempe road and Grand canal, on
Monday night. 8 p. m. sharp. An in
vitation to the general public. This
meeting is called to discuss ways and
means to find a better market for
general farm produce. This is of
special interest to all farmers. Come
out and hear what is said.
AN ABSTRACTOR.
Will tell you the exact condition
of the title to a property that you
think of buying. He is qualified by
training to find any flaws or shad
ings that may exist in it. In choos
ing a firm to look after this business
for you, it is quite necessary that you
get one that has no flaw to its title
to honesty, reliability and fair deal
ing. The Arizona Abstract and Title
Co. has established a reputation by
many years of careful work.
ARE YOU THINKING OF GETTING
A FENCE?
If you are, investigate the Ellin
wood fencing. Its small and perma
nent mesh is made by weaving one
continuous wire throughout the fab
ric. The mesh or stay wires are so
interwoven that slipping is impossible.
Built for general use, in one of the
six heights made, answers every pur
pose of a perfect fence for horses,
cattle, hogs, pigs, and sheep. Sold
by Talbot and Hubbard, at "The sign
of the Dog."
MOTION PICTURES.
The very best moving pictures in
Phoenix, without any exception are
to be seen at the Savoy. They are
clear and do not have that distress
ing glitter so common to most photo
plays. The pictures are also larger
and of the most recent release, the
operator of the machine is an expert
and if you want to see hurry pic
tures that you will enjoy, go to the
Savoy.
o
A NEW STORE..
That will sell excellent goods at
reasonable prices and employs men
for salesmen who are courteous and
obliging, soon demonstrates that the
old firms haven't everything grabbed.
The new furniture store at 335 W.
Washington St. has all of these qual
ifications and it is not surprising to
note that it had the contract for
furnishing the state capitol building.
The Barrows-Fooshee Co. also makes
a specialty of packing for people who
are about to move.
o
THE ALOOFNESS OF ART.
"What are your politics?"
"I don't dare tell. I'm the leader
of the best brass band in town, and
am liable to get a good job from
either party." Washington Star.

people grow discouraged because the

do not thrive well. If they consult
