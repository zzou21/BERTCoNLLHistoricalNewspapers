DR. PRATT, THE OPTICIAN
Attention:
Glass and Glasses.
Quite a difference in window glass
did you ever notice it?
Take the ordinary cheap glass; objects
seen through it are distorted and twisted
into weird forms and fantastic
shapes because of irregular surface,
thickness and density.
Through fine plate glass with its
smooth and polished surface, objects
are seen with distinctness, clear cut and
natural.
I fit only the best glasses, by modern
methods.

Stubborn
CORNS
Cured.
All corns are alike to Sure
Corn Cure; that is how much
better it is than other corn
cures. Hard or soft corns, new
corns or veterans, all fall before
it. And it is an easy, painless
cure. It doesn't hurt, doesn't
cause soreness, doesn't give you
any trouble at all except the
slight trouble of applying it
two or three days. Make up
your mind to be rid of corns
right now.
Price, 25c.

BIRTH OF A DAUGHTER. There

her husband reside at Buckeye, but for
some time she has been stopping with
friends in this city.

PAYING FOR HIS FUN. Navarro
Cordova was before Justice Burnett
yesterday accused of drunkenness and
disturbance of the peace the night
before. The accusation was very easily
sustained and he was fined $7, which in
his case meant seven days in the county
jail.

SPECIAL CAR SERVICE. The
Phoenix Street Railway company this
afternoon and tonight will give a spe
cial twenty-minute car service on the
Indian school line for the benefit of
those who wish to attend the commen
cement exercises which are in progress
at the school this week.

A BOY IN THE FAMILY. There
was born yesterday morning to Mrs.
Frank T. Alkire, a boy. George Alkire,
the uncle, is responsible for the state
ment that it tipped the beam at twenty
pounds. It is possible that by today
when he recovers somewhat from his
excitement he will consent to shade
those figures a little.

FIREMEN'S PICNIC. While the
firemen have made no wild demonstra
tion yet concerning their annual picnic,
to be held at Eastlake park June 4th,
they are nevertheless working hard in
committee in preparation for that most
interesting event and promise to prop
erly entertain everybody who attends.

A FATHER NOW. Mr. Church Keryman
yesterday received the cheering
intelligence that he had become a fath
er shortly after midnight yesterday
morning. This good luck happened to
him at Macon, Ga., where Mrs. Berryman
has been visiting relatives for the
last month. It is a girl and the
telegram states that both it and the
mother are doing well.

A NEEDY WOMAN. A woman ar
rived here yesterday morning from
Colorado in very needy circumstances.
She was accompanied by one child six
weeks old and another two years old.
Her necessities were reported to the
city marshal, who apprised the mem
bers of the W. C. T. U. of the woman's
presence and condition, the members of
that organization assuming care of her.

POLICE COURT. There were but
two cases in the police court yesterday,
one being the Mexican arrested the day
before in the belief that he was also
insane. The nature of his ailment was
only whisky and the extent of his pun
ishment will be five days in jail. The
other case was that of Juan Lopez, the
man who ate up the stock in trade of
the Capitol chop house. He was also
drunk and was jailed for five days.

DEFEATED BUT NOT CAST
DOWN. At a meeting of the Young
Men's Democratic club last night it was
decided to hold another meeting next
Monday for the purpose of showing
that the club has no notion of disband
ing. It will also be made the occasion
for the installation of the recently
elected officers. There will be inspir
ing speeches and refreshments. The
attendance will not be confined to the
membership of the club or to that of
the democratic party. All are welcome.
The more who attend the more will see
how the club can stand adversity and
grin while it is doing it.

BACK TO PHOENIX. K. S. Turner
has returned to Phoenix, accompanied
by his father and mother, and expects
to remain here permanently. For some
time past Tucson has been his head
quarters and he has covered the terri
tory between Los Angeles and Alamogordo,
N. M., for the Barkley Stetson
Preston Co. of Los Angeles. Early this
month, however, he suffered an attack
of nervous prostration and had to stay
in bed a few days. He is much better
now, but has decided to give up travel
ing, at least in that section. Incident
ally the firm has changed its name
again recently, Mr. Barkley retiring.

REVIVAL MEETING. "The Signs
of a Coming Revival" was the theme of
Rev. Walter Holcomb's discourse at the
Central Methodist church last evening.
His remarks were based on Zechariah
12:10. The reverend gentleman stated
that the signs were, (1) a spirit of un
rest among God's people, an earnest
desire to see others saved; (2) a spirit
of expectancy God's children looking
for and expecting a revival; (3) a spirit
of intercession, the followers of Jesus
Christ earnestly praying for the salva
tion of sinners. Those present ex
pressed themselves as very much pleased
with Rev. Holcomb's method of pre
senting the truth. He will preach to
day at 10:30 a. m. and 8 p. m. Every
body is invited to attend.

FROM THE RESERVOIR SITE. C.
R. Oldberg and Jesse Henderson ar
rived here yesterday from the Tonto
reservoir site and are stopping at the
Commercial hotel, but expect to start
back again today. Mr. Oldberg is as
sistant to Arthur P. Davis of the United
States geological survey, and is person
ally in charge of the engineering work
going on in the reservoir basin now.
The surveys for the power canal are
completed, but there are many other
surveys yet in progress. The canal
project, however, is all ready for the
running of the permanent line and the
beginning of excavation as soon as the
orders are given. When that will be,
as readers of The Republican know,
will depend on the action of the land
owners of this valley in signing the
articles of incorporation of the Water
Users' association. Mr. Oldberg on his
trip down went over one proposed line
for the construction of a road from
here to the dam site and will return by
another that he may make comparisons
for future use.
