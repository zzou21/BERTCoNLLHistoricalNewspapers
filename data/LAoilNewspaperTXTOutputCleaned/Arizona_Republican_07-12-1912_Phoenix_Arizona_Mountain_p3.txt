ORIENTAL MYSTIC
FINALLY CONVICTED

Jury Finds Tufts Guilty on Second
Trial.

Notice to Creditors of the Over
land Telephone & Telegraph Co.
You are hereby notified to present at the office
of the Company, 246 West Adams Street, Phoenix,
Arizona, prior to July 15, 1912, a statement duly
certified to as to its correctness showing in detail
the amount due from the Overland Telephone and
Telegraph Company. Adjustment of differences, if
any, will then be made and a voucher given therefor
upon the Phoenix Savings Bank and Trust Com
pany, for payment in event the proposed sale to be

Y. P. Matheson, Secretary and Treasurer.

When a man comes all the way
from far off Canada just to shake
hands with a man he has never seen,
man number two must be a celebrity
or some other species of genius.
C. M. McFarlane, R.A., secretary
McGill University Conservatorium,
Montreal, Canada, is the way the
visitor's card reads. The visitee is
Harry Welch, who is now in San
Francisco pulling for the Salt River
Valley with all his well known
might.

The desire on the part of Mr. Mc
Farlane to see Harry and the won
derful country of which the secre
tary is never through talking, came
from a prolonged correspondence, in
which many letters and much printed
literature on Arizona were sent to the
Canada town. Such was the enthu
siasm awakened in the breast of the
professor at the glowing reports, he
took the opportunity while in Los
Angeles on a vacation, to run over to
see for himself the land of promise.
Although he entered this section of
Arizona at what is considered the
most unfavorable time, Mr. McFar
lane is more than glad he made the
trip. Another year, he says will find
him among the residents of the great
southwest, presumably the Imperial
Salt River Valley.
Mr. McFarlane showed up at the
Board of Trade as soon after he ar
rived in Phoenix as he could dis
cover the place. He was much dis
appointed to find Welch gone, but
is consoled in the hope the secretary
will return before the end of the
week. It is understood, Harry is try
ing to break away over in California
and plans to be back Saturday. In
that event, Mr. McFarlane will meet
the boostmaster for a long talk-it-over.

NEPHEW OF HIS UNCLE

Valeska Suratt, the pretty Indiana
actress whose bewitching costumes and
exquisite headgear won for her the
reputation of being the best gowned
woman on the stage, is bankrupt.
H. J. Baker of Terre Haute, Miss
Suratt's home, filed a petition in
bankruptcy on behalf of the actress in
federal court here, setting out liabil
ities aggregating $42,479.69 and assets
of only $18,250. Aside from Miss Su
ratt's heavy indebtedness to Robert T.
Mackay, who it is said assisted in fi
nancing a number of plays in which she
"starred," the bulk of indebtedness is
for gowns, hats and other feminine ap
parel and luxuries. The schedule of
debts is one of the most unusual ever
filed here.
Miss Suratt is indebted to a Paris
milliner for $425 for hats which she
bought while abroad. She owes another
hatter $80 for picture headgear. Her
indebtedness for photographs is $100,
which she owes the White Studio of
New York. She owes $218.62 for flow
ers, according to her schedules, that
amount being due Charles A. Dard, a
New York florist.
Her bill for fancy meats, which re
main unpaid is $84.13, due Frank A.
Welton of New York. The famous
Lamb's Club of New York also is listed
among her creditors, the amount of her
bill there being $60. Her dressmakers
of New York and elsewhere also are
among her creditors. Her largest item
for gowns is $619, due Marie Donnjan,
a New York modiste.
Miss Suratt is indebted to Mr. Mac
kay in notes and cash for $14,750, ac
cording to the schedule. She owes
garment cleaners about $600. H. J.
Ward & Brother of New York is a
creditor for $170 for the storage of
costumes and scenery.
Miss Suratt's schedule shows that of
her assets $16,000 is due her from the
Mattoon Amusement Company, 222
Broadway, New York. She lists her
wearing apparel at $150. One tiger rug
and one bear rug are among her other
assets. She also owns scenery and cos
tumes valued at $1,100, according to the
statement. From the Indianapolis
News.

FIGHTING AND PRAYING

How the Prohibitionists Avoided Any
Monotony

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
ATLANTIC CITY, July 11. After a
day of almost constant wrangling, in
terspersed with hymns and prayer, the
national prohibition convention tonight
overthrew the existing administration
and elevated G. Hinshaw, of Portland,
Ore., to the national chairmanship of
the party. The convention voted down
a proposed plank in the platform de
manding that "the separation of the
church and state be perpetual and that
no public money be appropriated to
sectarian churches and schools."

THOMAS RILEY MARSHALL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
FOR VICE PRESIDENT, MRS. MARSHALL AND THEIR
SIMPLE HOME IN WHICH THEY LIVE IN INDIANA

Will Be Utilized, Although Millions of
Cubic Yards Have Escaped

It is not known exactly what are the
intentions of the Hungarian minister of
finance as to the utilization of the
natural gas in Transylvania, several
million cubic yards of which have al
ready escaped, but it is likely that be
fore the end of the year the gas will
be in use in one or more of the towns
and industrial plants in the immediate
vicinity of the wells. The gas pro
ducing region comprises some 5800
square miles, and the government has
so far put in over twenty wells, vary
ing in depth from one thousand to
3300 feet. It is thought that the sup
ply of gas will last for at least fifty
years. Eventually the gas will be
brought to Budapest, although prob
ably not for a few years. In any case,
as soon as it appears that the public
is to have natural gas placed at its dis
posal there will be an immediate de
mand for meters, purifiers, pipes,
valves, stoves, burners in short, for
everything used in the exploitation of
natural gas. There is no reason why
American manufacturers, if they em
ploy the proper methods, should not
have the bulk of this business, as the
American preeminence in this line of
manufacture is generally recognized in
this country. Consular and Trade Re

INDIANAPOLIS, July 11. Governor Thomas Riley Marshall, the democratic nominee for vice president,
and Mrs. Marshall are an ideally happy pair. They have no children, are devoted to each other and live as
quietly as his public life permits in a modest home. Governor Marshall was born in Indiana and never has
lived outside the state. The same is true of Mrs. Marshall. The governorship of the state was his first po
litical office. Governor Marshall's father was a nephew of the late Chief Justice Marshall.
