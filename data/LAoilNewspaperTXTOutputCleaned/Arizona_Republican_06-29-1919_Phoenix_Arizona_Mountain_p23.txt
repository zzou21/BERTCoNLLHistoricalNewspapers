the peace treaty.

Call loans repeated their recent fif
teen per cent maximum, but subse
quently fell back to 5 per cent when it
became evident that most of the in
year's large disbursements for inter
est and dividends were well in hand.

Bankers discouraged the idea of an
indefinite continuance of easy money,
pointing out that the moving of bumper
crops and demands of general busi
ness were bound to impose heavy bur
dens on capital for the balance of
the year.

Progressive industrial improvement
is noted in the diminution of labor dif
ficulties, increased production and the
maintenance of prices. Export condi
tions in the steel and iron trade are
especially encouraging, sales for May
having been the largest since Decem
ber 1917.
Figures dealing with the country's
record breaking foreign trade balance
for the fiscal year will not be obtain
able for another fortnight, but pres
ent indications point to an enormous
increase over the May returns, which
showed an excess over imports of
$3,505,000,000.

Recent auto travelers from Los Angeles report the condi

fairly good condition, and much travel is made over this route at
the present time.
The reports on the road via Wickenburg and Parker also
show that highway to be in fair condition excepting a few rough
places. The road via Palo Verde and Parker is said to be per
haps 20 miles shorter than the "Wickenburg" route.
Motorists should take notice that the Blythe ferry on the
Ehrenburg road is not operating on account of the high water
