TEMPE.
DEATH OF HAROLD DARLINGTON
A Former Bright Student of the Tempe
Normal School.
It is with deep regret that the news
came to Tempe describing the death
of Harold Darlington in a railroad
wreck at Godfrey, Kan., on December
21.
Mr. Darlington was one of the stu-
dents at the normal school, where,
during his two years' attendance he
was one of the brightest young men,
gaining considerable fame as a literary
wit. His mother in the family home
in Oklahoma City, O.T., writes one of
his chums here describing his death as
follows:
'I must tell you of the terrible ac-
cident that caused Harold's death,
for I know you will feel an interest in
him. He quit the postoffice last
spring and entered the railway mail
service on May 13. As he had to "sub-
stitute" months, he was sent on service on
different roads. When the time was up
he was appointed to run from Caldwell,
Kan., to Fort Worth, Texas, and
he was formally transferred Dec. 16.
running from here to Kansas City.
He was so anxious to be at home a
part of the time, and would be here
one day in five. He ate his supper at 5
o'clock Sunday, Dec. 20, and said:
"Good bye; I will be back the 24th."
The next morning at Godfrey, a sta-
tion six miles this side of Fort Scott,
Kansas, the train ran into a switch.
A long freight train was on the main
line with a dead engine. The passeng-
ers were not warned. The baggage
car jumped clear over the engine, but
the mail car was broken into kindling
wood. Harold was hurt internally, but
not burned as badly as many others
were. He died on Sunday morning,
Dec. 27, at 4:30. He had just receiv-
ed word from the head mail clerk that
his salary was raised from $900 to
$1,000."
Mr. Darlington was a grandson of
Mr. S. N. Phillips, formerly of Phoenix
and a councilman from the third
ward.
While at school at Tempe he became
very popular with his schoolmates, be-
cause of his great amiability and his
talents with the pen. For two years
he kept his many comrades supplied
with continued stories, often writing
many as thirty sheets in a day.
They always sparkled with rich wit
and local appreciation.
He was one of the best read boys of
his age and had a marvelous memory.
It is with deep regret that his many
friends here learn of his untimely
death.
NEW ROAD COMPLETED.
In Several Ways It Is a Vast Improve-
ment Over the Old One.
The new road from the bridge to
the Tempe road, a little this side of
Bernard's, has been almost finished for
some time, in fact the road itself has
been entirely completed, but the cross-
ing was not put in over the M. and P.
track. This was done intentionally be-
cause it was thought better to have
the road traveled over as little as
possible before it had been ramed on.
The rain last week, though light, did
the work and yesterday the crossing
over the track was fixed. It is a good
crossing, too, something that cannot be
said of the Santa Fe crossings on that
side of the river.
The road has been well graveled its
entire length, and besides avoiding
two bad railroad crossings and a long
drive directly next to the trees short-
ens the distance between here and
Phoenix to a small extent.
A TALLY HO PARTY.
Last evening a number of Tempe
people attended a banquet at Phoenix,
given by the Degree of Honor of that
place. It was in honor of the installa-
tion of the Order of United Workmen
there. Those from here were driven
over in a tally-ho. Composing the par-
ty were: Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Hodnett,
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Thompson, Mr.
and Mrs. T. Dickinson, Mr. and Mrs.
Sam Brown, Mr. Andre, M. K. Curry,
A. A. Calaya, Mr. and Mrs. Finch,
Mr. and Mrs. G. R. Nichols.
MORE QUAIL.
If things keep up at the rate they
have been going the past few days
the quail in the vicinity of Kyrene
will soon be extinct. Their number
was considerably decreased Sunday by
a party from Tempe, and yesterday
another hunting party left for that
neighborhood with the avowed inten-
tion of doing better than the other
party did on the Sabbath. They were
G. N. Gage, Thomas H. Means, D. S.
McLean and L. B. Wilson.
RINGING HOGS.
Geo. Dobson has put in his spare
moments the past few days in adorn-
ing several hundred head of hogs with
rings. For some time they have been
acting as pigs in the alfalfa field
and the rings are placed in their noses
for the purpose of stopping this root-
ing. Those that are to be sold soon
get off easy, as they are hindered with
only one, while those that he will keep
have three inserted to keep them
quiet.
A CASE OF CHEEK.
Geo. S. Baker, manager of the En-
terprise here, has often been credited
with an unlimited amount of cheek,
and it is all the more apparent at pres-
ent on account of a tooth that has
been causing him some trouble late-
ly. It may be some consolation to him
though to know that he has the sym-
pathy of his many friends.
TALKED AT THE NORMAL.
Rev. Rollins of the M. E. church
was a visitor at the normal yesterday
morning, and at the opening exercises
made a short and interesting talk to
the students.
A NEW WAGON.
J. F. Haigler took a load of hogs to
Phoenix yesterday and returned. He
expects to take several more loads to
the same market in the near future.
PERSONAL MENTION.
H. Gates, organizer for the A. O. U. W.,
was in town yesterday.
Harry Archibald will leave this
morning for Nogales.
W. P. Richardson was here yester-
day morning.
Mrs. Henry Shousen is at Superior,
where she was called suddenly last
week by the illness of her daughter,
Mrs. Ivy Burleson.
FOR SALE.
If sold within twenty days $2,750
buys 35 acres one-fourth mile of city
limits, one mile of Tempe creamery.
Water in Tempe canal, all in grain and
alfalfa. Just the place for small dairy.
Also one twenty-acre tract for sale for
cash, well improved with plenty of

MESA
FAREWELL RECEPTION
LONG.
TO REV.
Rev. L. K. Long, who is soon to
leave on a mission to England will be
tendered a grand farewell reception
Thursday night, beginning at 7:30
o'clock at the Mesa opera house. All
Mesa ward, Melchisedek priesthood
including the priests quorum and lodge
and other officers of the stake are es-
pecially invited and an elaborate pro-
gramme will be carried out.
HEALTHY GROWTH.
The rural free delivery mail route
of Mesa has proven to be a great suc-
cess both in the number of pieces
handled and in the way it has been
conducted by the able carrier, S. L.
McArthur.
There were 7,822 pieces of mail car-
ried during the month of December.
This is an increase of over 2,000 pieces
over the month of November. There
are a few more than 100 boxes on the
route and it will no doubt be of consid-
erable interest to patrons of The Ari-
zona Republican to know that there
are seventy-four subscribers on the
route. Republicans are delivered into
73 boxes every one a paid subscriber.
BACK FROM NEW MEXICO.
Bob Fellers yesterday arrived from
Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he has
been located for the past five years.
His family preceded him about two
months ago. He says that he will
now make Mesa his permanent home
again.
NEW SHOP.
A new blacksmith shop is soon to be
doing business at Mesa. E. Crismon
is building a shop adjoining his build-
ing on the east.
F. W. Terney is having plans drawn
for a new residence large enough for
two, "so the birds say."
W. D. Jones, of Lehi, is reported to
be improving rapidly which news will
be very gratifying to his host of
friends who a few days ago despaired
of his life.

THE OIL WELL A CERTAINTY.
It is now certain that in the next
ninety days a California company will
be here for the express purpose of put-
ting up the latest improved machinery
and will start boring for oil says the
Winslow News. The place selected
for the well will be six miles north of
Winslow on what is known as the base-
ball grounds. J. E. Wilson of Los
Angeles, who discovered the famous
Coalinga Oil fields in Fresno county,
California, while here recently con-
summated a deal with the various par-
ties holding claims on these grounds
and they have surrendered their rights
to the land and in return are to receive
shares at the rate of thirty shares for
each acre located by them. The locat-
ors of these grounds have also pur-
chased a limited amount of working
stock. J. K. Wilson and C. White Mor-
timer of Los Angeles are at the head
of this gigantic enterprise. They pro-
pose to put the well down 3,000 feet,
should they not be able to strike oil in
paying quantities at a depth of 1,500
feet. Mr. Wilson as soon as he re-
turns from a short business trip to
Mexico will commence preparing the
ground for the commencement of work.
The year 1904 will surely be a banner
year in the history of Winslow, as the
striking of oil, and it is surely here,
will cause a great amount of capital
to come here to be invested from all
over the United States. It also means
a great increase of our population, and
in fact it means that Winslow, ere
long, will become a great city.
His Bright Thought.
They stood in the darkness, hand in
hand, looking out into the night.
"Dearest," said she sadly, "what
does it make you think as you look out
into the illimitable space?"
"Why you know," said he thought-
fully, smiling down at her. "I always
think with so much space there ought
to be room enough for everybody." —Minneapolis
Journal.
"What is your idea of a popular
tune?"
"A popular tune," said the man who
takes music seriously, "is one that gets
to be universally disliked." —Washington Star.

STUD POKER CAUSES TROUBLE,
Deal Where Both Players Proved to Be
Losers in the End.
"When I was a young man," said
the gray-haired young-looking man in
the club smoking room, "much of the
United States now that seems middle
aged and staid and settled down was
wild and unsettled. Men carried revolvers
more commonly and used them more
freely than they do now.
"Naturally draw poker was the
starting point in many of these diffi-
culties. There was a case of this kind
in a small town on the river, not a
thousand miles from Cincinnati, that
I never managed to forget, though I
have wished a good many times that
I could.
"It wasn't draw poker either, but
stud poker that began the trouble.
There isn't such a tremendous differ-
ence between the two when you con-
sider them merely as games, but I
have noticed that stud is far more like-
ly to lead to trouble than draw. It's
a fierce game with a good many more
openings for controversy.
"This truth was borne in on me with
a good deal of force as I watched the
developments of that particular game.
I was one of the players, but fortu-
nately for me I had no hand in the
quarrel that broke up the game or the
shooting that the quarrel led up to.
"We were playing stud poker for
table stakes in a back room of a saloon
down by the river. It was probably
the most respectable house of the kind
in town, but I must confess the kind
was not much to brag on.
"The front of the place was a bar
room, the rear was a gambling hell.
It is true that roughness and rowdyism
were discouraged by the proprietor of
the place, and as his way of discourag-
ing a man was to throw him out of the
house bodily, there was very little
rowdyism there. But, although one was
tolerably safe from fisticuffs in this
place, there was no insurance against
pistol play.
"As usual when stud poker is played
in a gambling house, the cards were
dealt by an employee of the house and
there was a lookout as well who
watched the kitty, but, excepting for
the fact that the kitty was inordinate, I
believe it was a square game. There
didn't seem to be any object in cheat-
ing and besides, I knew most of the
players and I was satisfied.
"One of them I didn't know came in
to the game just after I had bought
chips. He took $50 worth as we all
had done and sat two seats to my left
in a place just vacated by a young
fellow who had gone broke and hadn't
cared or hadn't been able to buy in
again. That made eight players
again and the game went on as before.
"The second man to my right was a
good-natured old farmer who used to
come to town once in a while for a
spree, and generally wound up in Cal
Hamilton's place where we were that
night. He invariably went away broke;
but as he never brought a consider-
able sum of money with him, and as
he was fairly well-to-do, his little
dissipation never hurt him much. Jerry
White was his name and he was a man
of some influence at home.
"The newcomer's name I never knew.
There was some dispute about it af-
terward, but the general opinion seem-
ed to be that he was a crossroads gam-
bler from Missouri named Jack Am-
bler. Whatever the name was he was a
plunger. He started right in to bet
his hands as he had 'em and on the
third deal he got nipped. Buying
again he lost that in two deals, and
taking a third stack he ran it up to
$150 in five minutes.
"Then came a hand in which I
thought for a time I had an interest for
I had queens back to back. I sat too near
the first better to raise on the
first round, and on the second round
he had a pair of kings showing so I
folded my queens. Enough of the oth-
er players retired also to leave only
three players in.
"Those were Jerry White the man
they called Jack Ambler and a quiet
young fellow named Kirby, who kept
a livery stable and was known as a
sport. White was the man who had a
pair of kings in sight and for his
fourth card he caught a seven spot.
"Ambler had an ace and ten showing
and caught a five spot for his next
card. Kirby had three spades show-
ing. White had bet his pile on the third
card, and Ambler had raised it $50,
thus making a side bet, of course, and
leaving White with a show down for
his money, for Kirby had seen the
raise.
"On the last round neither man bet-
tered excepting that Kirby drew an-
other spade, making a possible flush.
As White was all in it was Ambler's
first bet and he put up $50. Kirby
never turned an eyelash, but pushed
$150 into the pot as coolly as if he
really wanted a call.
"Ambler studied a bit and looked at
Kirby closely but there was no indica-
tion and after a little he passed but
he still kept his cards in his hand. No
body noticed this at the time it seemed
but afterward it was commented on.
"Kirby raked in the side money at
the same time that he turned over his
hand, showing four flush of spades and
a heart. That left White's two kings in
sight the best hand and he was reach-
ing for the original pot when Ambler
spoke up.
" 'Hold on,' he said, 'I've got your
kings beat. Is that all you have? Show
'em up.'
"White was amazed as some of the
rest of us were.
"All I've got is kings," he said won-
deringly as he turned over his buried
card. 'But what difference does that
make to you? You are not in it.'
"Not in it, hey?' exclaimed Ambler.
'I'll show you whether I am or not. I've
got aces and I stayed in that original
pot just as long as you did and put
just as much money in it as you did.
You can't freeze me out of that just
because I lost the side bet.' And he
showed aces and reached for the pot.
"Right there was where the peace-
able man was at a disadvantage. White
was eminently peaceable, and, more-
over, he was a little confused by the
way Ambler stated the case.
"There was more than one man at
that table who was in doubt for a mo-
ment whether Ambler was right or
not. And White was not a quick think-
er. He was tenacious of his rights,
though and he reached out to inter-
fere with Ambler's taking of the mon-
ey which he believed was his own and
then Ambler showed the yellow streak.
If he had been confronted with a pis-
tol in White's grasp things might have
been different, but when White spoke
it was in a conciliatory tone, and Am-
bler tried bluster.
"Pulling his own gun he pointed it
full in White's face, and with an oath
bade him take his hands off the money.
I do not think he meant to shoot, but
some one in the party tried to knock
his arm up and the gun exploded.
White fell dead and almost in the
same instant another pistol exploded
and Ambler fell dead.
"It was a curious thing that at the
investigation that was made no one
could be found who knew who fired
the second shot. It would seem as if
the proprietor of the place, if he really
shot Ambler, would have been seen to
shoot, but as I say no one could be
found who would acknowledge having
seen the shooting, so nobody was ever
punished for it.
"And I don't think I have ever heard
the particular question raised at stud
poker since then." —New York Sun.
THEY WANT TO RIDE FREE
Odd Excuses Given by Applicants Who
Railroad Transportation.
"If all the ingenuity, adroitness and
sheer nerve that are utilized every year
by persons scheming to extract passes
from railroad companies could be as-
sembled and directed toward the
achievement of some one great ob-
ject the devising, let us say, of a
practicable flying machine I can't see
how such a purpose could possibly fail
of accomplishment," said a well-known
railroad official. "The mad desire to
get something for nothing which is
prevalent in the world today, is no-
where capable of more striking exem-
plification than in the letter files of a
railroad passenger agent."
Several months ago a Baltimore cit-
izen, perfectly well able to pay rail-
road fare to whatever point he wished to
go and possessing no possible claim
upon a railroad for free transportation,
applied by letter to Baltimore passen-
ger agent for a pass to New York and
return. The reason he advanced why-
he should be furnished with the trans-
portation to and from New York was
palpably so flimsy that his request was
firmly, yet politely, turned down by
return mail.
A week or so later he sent another
request for the transportation to and
from New York, presenting this time
a little better reason for granting of
the request by the passenger agent
But the reason wasn't quite good
enough, and the request was again re-
fused. Three days later the man's re-
quest for a pass to New York and back
was granted. He had facts, figures and
references all of which were verified.
all of which made it out of the ques-
tion to refuse him again. The compli-
mentary pass to New York and return
was accordingly sent to him.
It came back to the passenger agent
by return mail. Accompanying it was
this gloating note:
"Well, I got it, didn't I? I just want-
ed to see if I could, that's all, and I
win. I don't want to go to New York
and so I return the pass."
Not long ago a man in a southern
city tackled a passenger agent for
transportation to Philadelphia and re-
turn. The passenger agent had never
seen or heard tell of the man before,
so it was no mere motive of cur-
iosity that prompted him to inquire of
the fellow upon what ground he was
applying for free transportation.
"Well," replied the man who wanted
to ride free. "I've got a dog that's a
walking ad for your line of cars."
"Have, hey?" said the passenger
agent, willing to "examine the works"
of a new scheme for the manipulation
of the free pass dodge. Let's have a
look at your dog. How does he ad-
vertise the road."
The man went to the door and whis-
tled, and presently there came slink-
ing into the passenger agent's office a
common, under-fed looking mutt.
The dog proved, however, to be quite
intelligent for a hopeless looking cur.
The man who desired the railroad
to ride him for nothing had a hastily
devised blackboard about two feet long
under his arm. On the writing side of
the blackboard he scrawled to the
right in big printed characters with a
piece of chalk the initials of the rail-
road over which he was trying to get
the free transportation. On the left of
the blackboard he scribbled the initials
of the name of the competing railroad
out of the town.
"Now, Towze," said the man who
wanted to ride gratis, "What's the best
railroad to ride on to Philadelphia?"
The poor mutt raised a weary right
paw and pointed to the right side of
the blackboard and barked feebly.
"See?" said the man triumphantly.
"Great scheme for your road isn't it?
You give me the pass to Philly and
back and I'll stand over in front of the
depot of your rival road and I work this
blackboard trick for a whole day
Look how it would build up your
local business."
Then the passenger agent gently
but determinedly nudged the man
with the unique advertising dog to-
ward the door, and the man went down
the street with the most absurd ex-
pression imaginable.
Once in a great while, however, the
free-ride applicant has a joke on the
passenger agent. At a meeting of the
passenger agents not long ago one of
them told one on himself. He had
been elevated from a position of sup-
erintendent of a passenger division
for an eastern railroad to that of as-
sistant general passenger agent of a
line in the middle west. He had never
met any of the officials of the road that
gave him the lift in position. On the
second day after he took hold of his
new job a countrified old man with
bulgy store clothes and a considerable
suit of tangled white Galways clomped
into his office and said:
"Young man will you be good enough
to fix me out with ridin' from here to
Omaha and back?"
The new assistant general passenger
agent looked the queer looking old
man over amusedly.
"Perhaps first, gran'pa," he said,
"you'd better tell me what makes you
think you're entitled to 'ridin' from
here to Omaha and back on this line
of cars?"
"Oh nothin' 'ceptin' that I'm the pres-
ident of the road," replied the coun-
trified looking old man with a broad
smile. —Washington Star.

No. 185 West 88th Street,
New York City, N. Y., April 1, 1908.
Wine of Cardui has been a blessing to my home. I have
often found that it was a great relief when I was weary or in
pain, but I am especially grateful for what it did for our
daughter and only child. I noticed that her menses were
tardy and she suffered with headaches and dizziness, hear-
iness in the abdomen and about the loins. This seriously in-
terfered with her studies and she had to discontinue several
of them.

BUDA-PEST.
Situated on the river which hears
more tongues than any other on its
long journey to the sea, feeling the in-
fluence of the Orient as well as the Oc-
cident, expressive of a race whose
heart is young, is Pest, one of the new-
est of cities, joined by a hyphen and
five bridges to Buda, one of the oldest
of capitals. Hence there need be no
strife between the sentiment that
would put something more serviceable
in its place. In much the same way
that one may have portraits of his an-
cestors hung on the walls of a steam
heated house, without interfering with
the utilities, so the Magyar from a
comfortable chair in his cafe, while he
listens to stock exchange quotations or
the opera over the telephone, may look
across the Danube at the monuments
of the Hungarian past. On our parts
we should have a parallel if Washing-
ton were the commercial metropolis as
well as the capital and we moved the
heights of Arlington farther down the
Potomac and crowned them with Lib-
erty Hall, Castle William, and "Old
South Church."
In other European cities where an old
municipal site adjoins a modern, though
hills are leveled and moats filled
the cramping effect of narrow alley
ways and crooked streets still remains.
The heights of the Buda site formed a
