RESULT OF REGULAR
OLD TIME ROMANCE

Was Marriage of I. C. Ryf, Former
Phoenix Boy and Florence
Maxfield of Globe.

Reception in Honor of Roy
Tolleson Who Leaves to
Take Up Similar Work in
the Y. M. C. A. Field in
Chicago

Members of the Y. M. C. A. and
other friends of Roy Tolleson, the
retiring boys’ secretary of the insti
tution will hold a reception and a
good-bye party tonight at the Y.
M. C. A. building.
People who have known and liked
Tolleson in the time he has been a
familiar figure among the young folk
of Phoenix are more than numerous.
The secretary has been connected
with various kinds of church and
institutional work. He is prominent in
social lines and for the
last year and a half conducted the
boys’ department of the Y. M. C. A.
He was recently married, and with
his wife will leave Monday for Chi
cago, where he will enter the Y in
the same department that has re
ceived his care while he lived in
Phoenix. Mrs. Tolleson will be at the
reception tonight to assist in the
leave-taking.
J. L. Hutchinson, who takes Tolleson’s
place here, has been associate pastor
of the North Methodist Church for
about a year. Lately he was connect
ed with the Valley Bank. He returned
yesterday from Los Angeles, where
he has passed the summer acquiring
a knowledge of the work he will soon
take up. He is well known in Phoe
nix, and his friends are all predict
ing every success for his work among
the boys.
The new secretary is a graduate
of Northwestern University at Evanston,
Illinois. This is his first ex
perience in Y. M. C. A. work, but
he is well fitted by other means to
make a career training the youth
of the “man-factory.”

A wedding that resulted from a
real dyed-in-the-wool romance—one
of the love-at-first-sight kind—took
place in Globe between I. C. Ryf and
Florence Maxfield.
What makes it interesting to Phoe
nix people is the fact Mr. Ryf was
formerly a resident of this city. He
was four years in the Santa Fe
office here. He worked in all ca
pacities, from stenographer to city
ticket agent. Being a railroad man,
he was naturally a popular fellow
among all the town boys, and girls
too, it must be admitted. It is said
of him, he had a new girl every Sun
day and several through the week.
But instantaneous love stepped in.
Ryf was taken with typhoid fever to
the hospital, and there the little lady
who cared for him, made his pillow
behave and handed him his glass of
water and magazine, captured his
fickle heart, and tied it down the
more securely for its previous ac
tivity. They do say that kind gets
it harder when the real serious dead-in-earnest
affection arrives.
Ryf is at present city ticket man
in the Globe, Southern Pacific office.

TIT FOR TAT.
On the viaduct that spans the bridle
path at Seventy-seventh street and
West Central Park, little Miss Muffet
paused, and, standing beside the sign
which warns pedestrians not to “loiter
on the bridge and annoy equestrians,”
looked down upon the riders who passed
below. Presently a dark-visaged,
resplendent young man on a fine big
bay horse, came around the curve of
the road. As he neared the viaduct he
raised his eyes and with a grimace in
tended for a smile, threw little Miss
Muffet a kiss.
“Oh,” thought the young woman dis
gustedly, blushing and drawing back,
“I’ll write to the park commissioner
when I get home and ask him to put a
sign on the bridle path warning eques
trians not to annoy pedestrians on the
bridge.” —New York Press.

On July 4 the entire sporting world
of the country and all others who
take a curious interest in passing
events, held its breath for the tele
graph flash which was to announce
whether the prize fight championship
of the world was to be wrested from
a negro, and the answer came in the
negative. It was followed by stories
disputing the fairness of the decision,
alleging that Flynn’s tactics of wear
ing out his adversary instead of
knocking him out had been improperly
passed upon, for all admitted
that Johnson was the bigger and the
stronger animal. Then came the
widely published act of Congress plac
ing a ban upon the taking of mov
ing picture films of prize fights for
exhibition purposes hereafter.
The special interest attaching to
this battle for world honors between
two races of people and the fact
that the reproduction of prize fights
by the moving picture process ends
with the display of the Johnson-
Flynn film, will make its exhibition
at the Empress theater in this city
tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday
night, an event of surpassing inter
est, even to scores who don’t give a
rap whether there is ever another
prize fight or not. This film is re
puted to be the perfection of the art,
showing clearly every move made by
the combatants during the episode in
which the big cannibal “ate the
white man up.” Panoramic views are
also presented that show the street
crowds in Las Vegas the night be
fore, the arrival of special trains
bearing the thousands who witnessed
the encounter, the training quarters
of the combatants and many other
scenes that formed a part of that
historic occasion.
That the fight fans will be present
each night of the exhibition is cer
tain, but there are many other people
who never witnessed a prize fight,
and never will, but who for the sim
ple sake of being informed in such
matters will desire to see it now,
their last opportunity, in every way
realistic, save for the blood of the
gladiators and the groans of the dis
satisfied or the sympathetic. It will
be a perfect fight, with nobody hurt,
the complete story of a famous one,
and for most people, the last chance
at any encounter of that nature.
The film has created a great deal
of enthusiasm wherever it has been
shown and Manager Reeves of the
Empress has been exerting himself
to secure its exhibition here ever
since it took up its devious course
through the picture houses of the
country.

QUEEN, A PRIZE WINNER AND SOME OF THE
PRETTY GET-UPS AT ASBURY’S BABY PARADE

THE LIGHT
OF OUR HOME

ASBURY PARK, N. J., Aug. 29. The twenty-second annual baby parade was the biggest success since the
affair was instituted. Miss Hazel Manners of Newark made a charming and beautiful Queen Titania, and many
of the entrants in the parade won applause for their attractiveness and originality. The queen prize, a pony
and cart, was won by Donald Lee Hamblet, two years old, who was the wick of a candle set in an immense
candlestick, representing “the light of our home.”

TEN DOZEN TROUT
ONE HOUR’S CATCH

Dr. A. S. Hawley Strikes Rich Vein
of Fish in Brook Near Pres
cott Vacations End.

A fish story backed by the weight
of a well known Phoenician’s word
ought to be believed. It is very true
there are places in the depths of
woods where trout are so undisturbed
at the appearance of a man, they
continue to ply their finny trades
without fear at his approach.
Such a sylvan retreat is that into
which Dr. A. S. Hawley strayed.
Where the speckled fish leaped from
their element to gulp the bright fly,
even before the cast was fully made
and the biting so good and often, the
angler scored a hundred and twenty
beauties in an hour, is indeed a
paradise for the followers of Master
Izaak Walton. Near Prescott it is, a
place removed from the intrusion of
the heavy treading fisherman.
Dr. Hawley has been away for a
month, and the crowning experience
of his vacation, that great fish, oc
curred near the end of the summer
outing. The doctor plans to
return to Phoenix on the first of the
month. Meantime, he will keep the
secret of the trout stream carefully
under his hat, for possible future use.

CAUTIOUS.

unanimously that it is the duty of cler
gymen to obey the act of parliament.
The matter has attracted a great
deal of attention. No one doubts the
sincerity, or fails to respect the scrup
les, of clergymen who believe that
marriage with a dead wife’s sister is
contrary to the laws of God; but the
lord chancellor, in delivering the decis
ion of the house of lords, made plain
the impossibility of regarding a man
and a woman as “open and notorious
evil livers,” when they have been mar
ried according to the laws of the realm.
The question has been settled so far as
the civil courts can settle it. But the
decision is not final; the Archbishop
of Canterbury and many other English
bishops by declaring that in church
matters the civil authority cannot ov
erride the authority of the church have
virtually advised the clergy to disre
gard the judgment of the house of
lords. —From the Youth’s Companion.

Harduppe—Not unless I pay him

o
FROWN ON A LEGAL MARRIAGE.

England’s Church Doesn’t Recognize
Union With a Dead Wife’s Sister.

Marriage with a dead wife’s sister,
although forbidden in the prayer book
of the English church, has long been
legalized in every British colony, and
in 1907, after an agitation extending
over many years, parliament legalized
it in England. Nevertheless, a great
many of the English clergy maintained
that divine law forbade them to sol
emnize such marriages. Most of those
who held that view have declined to
perform the ceremony, and one, at least,
refused to admit to holy communion
a couple who legally contracted such
a marriage in Canada a few months
before the act of parliament was
passed.
The prayer book authorizes a clergy
man to refuse the communion to per
sons who are “open and notorious evil
livers.” As the church is established
by law, every person who has been
confirmed is entitled to be received at
communion, unless there is good rea
son for excluding him; and anyone
who is excluded without sufficient rea
son can appeal to the courts to com
pel the offending clergyman to receive
him.
In the case mentioned above, the ag
grieved couple did appeal to the courts,
and the case was decided in their fav
or; but the clergyman carried the mat
ter up by appeal.
The decision was almost, or quite,
unanimous against him, until at last
the case reached the house of lords,
which is the final tribunal. There
again judgment has been rendered un
animously that it is the duty of cler
gymen to obey the act of parliament.
