A
The Berger Case From
Pima County for the En
forcement of an Agree
ment Is Filed in United
States Court
A case which has been brewing in
Pima county for several months was
filed in United States court yesterday.
The title of it is the United States
against Maria Berger and the Pima
Land and Water company. The object
of it is to compel the first named de
fendant to carry out an agreement
with the government and to have de
clared void a deed to certain property
given by this defendant to the Pima
Land and Water company.
Mrs. Berger is the widow of Capt. J.
M. Berger for many years sub-agent
or superintendent and disbursing
agent for the Indians at San Xavier
mission. He was the owner of a tract
of land of about sixty-one acres known
as Rancho de Martinez, located near
the San Xavier mission and nearly in
the center of the reservation.
Some twenty-five years ago the
government entered into an agreement
with Captain and Mrs. Berger for the
lease of the property from year to year
at $30 a month. Each lease carried
with it the option for another lease
and also for the purchase of the prop
erty at the price of $10,000. The last
written agreement was between the
Bergers and R. H. Abbott acting com
missioner of Indian affairs. It was
executed in June of 1910. At its ex
piration a year later Captain Berger
who has since died was quite ill but
another lease was agreed upon verb
ally. The rental was paid each month for the preceding month. In November
Mrs. Berger declined a tender of the
October rental and again in December
she refused to recognize the arrange
ment with the government by accept
ing the November rental.
In December the government elected
to avail itself of the terms of the lease
and purchase the property. The nego
tiations seemed to be proceeding toward a satisfactory end, Henry J. Mc
Quigg the superintendent of the school
at San Xavier representing the gov
ernment. Finally the day was agreed upon by
Mrs. Berger for the acceptance of the
purchase price $10,000. Payment was
to be made at the office of her attor
ney Charles Blenman of Tucson on
December 27. Though the agent waited there she did not appear but the
government learned that the next day
she executed a deed to the Pima Land
and Water company. It is understood
that the consideration was $12,000.
Since then the government still in
possession has regularly tendered Mrs.
Berger $150 each month and has also
since then made a tender of the pur
chase price.
The Pima Land and Water company is
said to have undertaken to open ne
gotiations with the government for the
sale of half the property at the price
paid Mrs. Berger but this proposition
has been accompanied by demands for
various concessions, such as rights of
way for ditches across the reservation
and for tunnels, to be used as parts of
a large irrigation system. The prop
erty is said to be quite valuable on
account of the water privileges.
o
THE NEGRO AND GOLF CLUBS.
Bob Hull, the champion storyteller
of Savannah, had occasion lately to
take a business trip into interior
Georgia. He took his golf clubs with
him, intending to stop off on his way
back for a match on the famous links
at Augusta.
He dropped off the train at his
business destination a small town
on a branch road and carrying his
luggage climbed into an ancient hack
and bade the driver, who was an old
negro man, take him to the local
hotel.
The negro eyed the queer looking
leather bag that his passenger car
ried with the peculiar looking sticks
in it. His curiosity got the best of
him finally.
"Boss," he began, "please, suh,
sence me but mout I ax you a ques
tion?"
"Go ahead and ask," said Mr. Hull.

STOP SNEEZING
AND SNIFFLING
For Hay Fever and Rose Cold Try
Ely's Cream Balm. It Gives
Instant Relief.
"Balm" is just the word for this
soothing, healing, antiseptic Cream.
Its effects in cases of Hay Fever and
Rose Colds are almost magical. You
just grease the nostrils with a little
of the Cream, inhale the pleasant,
aromatic fumes; and in a few min
utes your head begins to clear, the
soreness is relieved, and the sneezing,
sniffling and weeping stopped. Peo
ple who have suffered for years with
Hay Fever and Rose Cold can be free
from all the distressing symptoms by
simply using Ely's Cream Balm morn
ing and night during the Hay Fever
Season.
Hay Fever is due to an irritated,
inflamed condition of the mucous
membrane (inside skin) of the nose
and throat. Strong powders, snuffs
and sprays simply aggravate the
trouble, but Ely's Cream Balm
soothes, heals and strengthens the
raw, sore membranes, and in this
way not only relieves the trouble but
prevents its return.
All druggists sell and recommend
it. Get a fifty cent bottle today;
use it according to directions; get
your money back if you are not sat
isfied. Agent A. L. Boehmer.

CITY MARKET'S

E
One Hundred and Nine Cars
of Melons Shipped Within
Sixty-Four Days and Bus
iness Is Still on the In
crease Several statements have been made
concerning the amount of melons
handled by the Melon Growers associ
ation but the actual number of car
loads which have been shipped from
Phoenix has not been stated. The
books of the Arizona Produce Co. show
that within sixty-four days 109 cars
of melons have been shipped from the
local freight depots. Considering the
short time the Produce Co. has been
handling the valley products this is
an excellent showing.
Previously all melons handled by
the city market must weigh over ten
pounds but now the minimum weight
is 15 pounds. This change will natu
rally lessen the number of melons
shipped but the value will be about
the same.
At this time of year Texas produces
a much smaller melon than this val
ley does, thus strengthening the ship
ments here. But later in the season
Texas melons grow much larger and
then the Arizona Produce Co. finds its
only competitive market.
There is also a difference in the
shipping rates from here to Seattle
which makes a slight change in the
Salt River valley shipments. The dif
ference in the rates between Texas
and Seattle and Phoenix and Seattle is
about 22 cents thus giving Texas the
small advantage.
The City Market reports that
Thompson seedless grapes and figs
are coming in well and although the
shipments are not as large as they will
be, they are satisfactory. The local
shipments of water melons were great
er yesterday than they have ever been
before and business is on the increase
all the time. Yesterday three cars of
melons were shipped from Alhambra
to a foreign purchaser and the carload
lots are increasing every day.
If you are a housewife you cannot
reasonably hope to be healthy or
beautiful by washing dishes, sweep
ing and doing housework all day, and
crawling into bed dead tired at night.
You must get out into the open air
and sunlight. If you do this every
day and keep your stomach and bow
els in good order by taking Chamber
lain's Tablets when needed, you should
become both healthy and beautiful.

SPEAKING ABOUT
MOTOR CARS
Mrs. Bimson's Rich Friends Have
Motor Cars Now but It Was
Just a Subject She Wanted
to Speak to Her Hus
band About.
"Mrs. Upsilon called today." said
Mrs. Bimson to her husband. "She
has a bright green Arlington."
"What's that, a dress or a dis
ease?" demanded Bimson.
"It's a motor car."
"Oh! And she called on you to
give you a bright green case of envy,
I suppose?"
"She did nothing of the kind. She
called on me because she likes me."
"That was the reason I began call
ing on you," said Bimson, tactfully.
"Her yardman had been taught to
run the car perfectly," went on Mrs.
Bimson.
"Well, if you had a car and your
yardman would run it, since I am
your yardman."
"That's what I
want to talk to
That won't cost
you about."
"About a car?
much."
"Oh, can we afford it?"
"Certainly."
"Oh, you darling! What kind of
a car shall we get?"
"We can't afford to get any kind."
"But you said we could!"
"What I said was that we could
afford to talk about one."
"I wish you would be serious!"
"I am, every time you start the
car talk."
"Well, it was not the car I started
to talk to you about." concluded
Mrs. Bimson.
"Thank you!" exclaimed her hus
band. "You are too provoking. I don't see
why I have put up with you all these
years!"
"I'm very fascinating."
"Conceit is not wit."
"And wishes are not motor cars."
"Mrs. Davison called on me also."
"Everybody's doing it."
"Will you kindly explain what you
mean?"
"Everybody who has a new car is
calling on her friends who haven't
one."
"I suppose you think my friends
are trying to make me envious?"
"Not at all. They merely wanted
to cheer you up with the odor of
their gasoline."
"You are impossible today!"
Conundrum: Why am I a motor
car?
"Mrs. Davidson's yardman runs her
car also," said Mrs. Bimson, ig
noring his remark.
"Fine!"
"That's what I want to talk to you
about. About a yardman."
"Go ahead. Still, I think the aver
age yardman has enough trouble
without people talking about him.'
"We must have a yardman."
"Going to discharge me, are you?
Isn't my work satisfactory?"
"We have the prettiest yard in

"Davisons draws a salary."
"Don't you?"
"No; I merely get wages."
"Well, I am ashamed to have you

"Yes. I meant to ask you
that. What did she want?"
"She inquired me for whom

Bimson."
"Why, Tom Bimson!"
"She wanted to know what I was
getting. I told her my board
was $18 a month but that the clothes
were not very good."
"Oh, Tom!"
"Then she asked me if I was a
drinking man. I told her I wasn't."
"Tom! You never did!"
"Then she asked me if I used to
tobacco. I told her I smoked a cigar
occasionally."
"Oh, Tom! Those people are
wealthy and are bound to be social
leaders in the neighborhood. I shall
never get over it!"
"Then she asked me if I wouldn't
like to work for her."
"She didn't!"
"I told her that I didn't think you
would like to let me go."
"What did she say to that?"
"She said she would not think of
taking me away without your con
sent, but that she would call on you,
and she thought she could make ar
rangements that would satisfy you.
So now if you don't stop talking
motor cars I've got another job."
"Oh, Tom, you are impossible!"
"Well, I have decided to get a $7
suit of summer clothes, and loll
around on the porch while a yard
man clips the lawn after this."
"You're a dear!"
"But you wish I was like other
men, do you?"
"No, I have never wished that!
