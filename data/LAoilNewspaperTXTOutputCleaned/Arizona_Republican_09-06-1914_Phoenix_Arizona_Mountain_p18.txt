THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 6, 1914

THE MINES OF ARIZONA

This department is under the di
rection of Mr. W. E. Defty, the
well known mining engineer, who
will carefully scrutinize all mat
ter relating to mining in order
that only reliable information re
garding legitimate enterprise
shall find a place here.
The Republican would be pleas
ed to receive information from
any part of the state regarding
the development of the mining in
dustry. All communications
should be addressed: Mining De
partment, Arizona Republican.

The Metal and Mining Conditions Im
proving Considerably

Conditions in mining generally have
taken a very decided turn for the bet
ter and is already showing decided im
provement. The Mining and Scientific Press
says: With the gradual readjustment
of market conditions many of the
mines which suspended operations with
the beginning of hostilities in Europe
are again producing. Reports from
Idaho and Utah are extremely optimis
tic and the production of silver, lead
and zinc is again almost normal. While
the copper situation has not been de
termined, the position of zinc has been
strengthened and lead and silver are in
a much better position than they were
ten days ago.

As regards silver, it is reported to
have been sold in considerable quan
tities in New York, August 22 at 56
cents per ounce, that price being de
termined by a London quotation made
August 21, the first official quotation
since the war opened.

In Arizona matters look equally
bright, as will be seen by the following
letter from one of our smelter
companies written a day previous to
the London quotation.

American Smelting & Refining Co.
Hayden Plant
Hayden, Ariz.
Dear Sir:
We have the pleasure of advising you
that, although London still refuses to
bill for New York silver, our company
has been fortunate in making sales to
certain foreign governments and to
home manufacturers to an extent equal
to our receipts.
Therefore, we will settle in full for
all silver received August 12th to 19th
inclusive at the New York average of
our sales, named at 56¢ per ounce.
Furthermore, beginning with re
ceipts of August 20 and until further
advised we will advance against silver
shipments at the rate of 40¢ per ounce,
under the same conditions as per our
former letters.
Yours very truly,
AMERICAN SMELTING & MIN
ING CO.
By J. J. Ormsby, Superintendent.

In addition to the above a large pur
chase of silver has been made for the
coast mint. Word comes from Wash
ington that George E. Roberts, director
of the mint has bought 200,000 ounces
of silver for immediate delivery at the
San Francisco mint. The price was
53.1 cents an ounce.

In Arizona properties that tempo
rarily closed down, are again resuming
operations. The Commonwealth at
Pearce is operating again after a close
down of 3 weeks, the improvement in
price of silver warranted the resump
tion of operations. The company put
the old force back at work in the mill
and mine, and all operations are pro
ceeding and normal conditions resumed
as previous to the suspension of work.

At Tombstone the leasers on the old
property are now beginning to ship
quite a large tonnage of ore, after the
announcement that the smelters were
again prepared to accept ore for treat
ment. The leasers have accumulated
a large quantity of ore for shipment,
for the uninterruptedly continued ex
traction during the period the smelters
refused shipments.

Referring to the coppers, the condi
tions at the properties are certainly on
the improve. They are all holding
their reduced forces at least, and some
of them are gradually taking back
some of the old hands. At Miami both
the day and night shifts in the mine
have been increased and also addi
tions to the surface force have been
made, of course the latter is mainly on
constructive work. At other properties
where the forces have only been work
ing half time, the working days have
been increased at least for a part of the
men. The early movement of the red
metal to Europe, which is anticipated,
will also be an important factor in
strengthening and improving the situ
ation. So weighing all the conditions
together, we have in Arizona consider
able to be thankful for. We are not
nearly so badly off as some other
states and other parts of the world.

Quartzite
It is reported that machinery is being
hauled in and installed for the working
of the large area of placer ground
around this district. As the water
supply is limited, the machines will
operate as dry washers or concentra
tors. The area is well known and has
been and dry washed for over 50 years
and a large quantity of gold extracted.
The fact of the gold being there is un
questioned, the success of the enter
prise rests upon its extraction by this
new adopted dry process and we sin
cerely trust the test will exceed all
expectations; success will mean much
for that part of the country, for it has
been in a semi-dormant condition for
some years. A revival would make the
district look like old times, when it
used to be busy with quartz and placer
mines. It was then known as Tyson’s
Wells. The country is meritorious and
will sooner or later come by its own.
The country has suffered considerably
by fake propositions; one of these had
the parts of a 60-stamp mill strewn
right across the desert from Congress
Junction to Quartzite.

Magma Mine
The much reported rich strike in this
mine recently, is simply a continuation
of the high grade ore shoot encountered
in the upper workings and which
consists of bornite, chalcocite and
chalcopyrite, the ore is certainly beau
tiful in appearance and wonderful in
its being so high grade. On the 800
foot level of the mine, this rich ore
body was said to be 3 sets of timbers
wide, with scarcely a seam of waste in
it. Work was suspended on this level
for some time, pending a thorough
testing of the ground in all directions
by diamond drill holes and it is said
extensive disseminated copper areas
were proven, after the completion of
this work, shaft sinking was resumed
and continued to a depth of 1000 feet
where it is proven that this large and
rich ore body still continues. Down
to the 800 foot, the property had fine
levels, viz. 200, 400, 500, 630 and 800.
The 100 level is an adit 500 long, all
ingress and egress to the mine is made
through this working, instead of from
the collar of the shaft, as the latter is
situated in rather an awkward posi
tion on the hillside.

The new concentrator now treating
500 tons of ore per day was erected to
treat the ores from the disseminated
area and the fines from the shipping
ore. The conditions in the mine could
not be better and the concentrator is
working very successfully.

Superior
William Windsor, who owns four
claims close to town, and which ad
join the Lake Superior & Arizona
property on the south, reports he has
struck a body of high grade ore on his
claims and is extracting it for ship
ment. In Democratic Times
(Chicago News:) Agitated Stock
holder: Why haven't you declared the
regular quarterly dividend?
Director: We couldn't borrow the
money!

"Mineral Rods" Declared Fakes
Whether gold, silver and other prec
ious and useful minerals may be found
in the ground by means of mineral
rods is a question frequently asked.
The latest question of this sort came
from a correspondent in Vinemont,
Ala., who states that a man from Birm
ingham has one of these rods for lo
cating minerals, that he claims to be
employed by the government and that
the government gets half of what he
finds. This expert mineral finder’s
name is stated to be Wise, which may
or may not have significance. The
Geological Survey’s reply to this cor
respondent is that while an ordinary
compass, or “dip needle,” will be at
tracted to areas of iron, nickel or co
balt, which are magnetic, it will be af
fected by no other metals or minerals,
and that so-called mineral rods are
fakes. Anyone claiming to operate a
mineral rod on behalf of the govern
ment is an impostor and should be let
severely alone or reported to the police.
(Additional advice to this should be
given. The party believing in such
fakes should also be handed over to
the police or passed upon by the com
petent authority for graduation to the
asylum for the feeble minded.)

Owning All the Copper
Anent the drivel that was printed in
last week’s papers about the state
owning all the copper. It would be
something like the fellow who made
himself very objectionable on board the
small sailing vessel. The rest on board
to show their disapproval and after
careful deliberation, told the offender
they had decided to present him with
the entire ocean and threw him over
board, eventually he was picked up
greatly exhausted by a fishing smack.
And on recovery of his breath and
general composure, he remarked “I fully
appreciated the honor conferred upon
me by the presentation of that deep
and wonderful expanse of water, but,
I cannot do anything with the devilish
thing you know.”

Alaska Treadwell
The 1913 report of the Alaska Tread
well Gold Mining Company, Douglas
Island, Alaska, shows a net operating
profit for the year of $1,223,438 from
886,057 tons of ore, yielding an average
of $2.6617 or a total of $2,358,423 and
miscellaneous profits of $69,592. This
profit is exclusive of depreciation of
property and plant charged off
amounting to $400,207. Dividends
amounting to $1,000,000 were paid.
As will be observed by the above the
actual yield per ton of ore was only
$2.6617.

Gypsum
In 1913 the amount of raw gypsum
mined in the United States was close
to 2,600,000 short tons.

Arizona Copper
The Arizona Copper Company made
2,600,000 pounds of copper in July
which compares with 2,600,000 pounds
in July last year.
For the seven months the output was
23,524,000 pounds against 20,800,000
pounds in 1913.

High Cost of Ignorance
Platinum today is about the most
precious metal that the ordinary citi
zen ever sees. Weight for weight,
it is two and one-quarter times as
valuable as gold. In the days when
Pizarro’s conquistadores were racing
through South America looking for
gold and silver and for slaves to
mine the same, platinum was worth
just nothing at all. Which has led
to rather amusing results. Gold and
platinum are found together in the
sands of the Nagua and Atrato rivers
in the western part of the Republic
of Colombia. These placer mines
have been worked since before the
Spanish conquest and for centuries
the gold was saved and the platinum
thrown away. A metal like iron
would have rusted away and disap
peared, but platinum endures. Min
ing companies are looking for it this
moment in the dumps where it was
tossed 300 years ago, and in one
town among these ancient “diggings”
the earth excavated for a founda
tion has yielded enough platinum to
pay for the building.
What a building boom there would
be in an American city under such
conditions! The same story, minus
the reward for digging cellars, can
be told of many places. Metallur
gists of today estimate that one
third of the gold and silver of the
great Comstock lode was scattered
in waste over the Nevada deserts.
Silver has been mined at Laurion,
near Athens, for 2500 years, but
the most profitable branch of the
business in recent times has been
mining the waste of antiquity. The
waste attending the opening of early
oil wells and gas wells is known to
all.

Cal. Mine Output $26,812,489
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 25.—The
value of the recoverable gold, silver,
copper, lead and zinc produced in the
mines of California in 1913 was $26,
812,489, compared with $26,383,946 in
1912 and $25,174,677 in 1911, accord
ing to an announcement made to
day by Charles G. Yale of the United
States Geological Survey.
Except in zinc there was an in
crease in the output of all these
metals. The output of gold was the
largest in thirty-one years, totaling
$20,406,958. Only three times in forty-nine
years has the gold output
exceeded $20,000,000.

Cyanide to Be Manufactured in the
United States
(By Basores De Alzugaray)
The stoppage of the foreign supply
of cyanide and cyanogen compounds
creates a serious situation, not only
for the mining industries (extraction
of gold and silver), but also for many
other electrical and chemical trades
using cyanide. The means to meet
this temporary difficulty can be
easily devised. The raw materials
from which cyanogen and its com
pounds are prepared are abundantly
found in our country. This source
of raw products are many and will
be briefly reviewed.

A considerable quantity of cyanides
escapes from the blast furnaces, as
fumes and flue dust, from which
large amounts of potassium cyanide
can be recovered by methods anal
ogous to those in practice to purify
coal gas. Cyanide is produced not
only in iron blast furnaces, but also
and in large quantities in copper and
lead furnaces and in a general way
in any metallurgical apparatus
wherever the nitrogen of the blast
acts on hot carbon mixed with alka
lies. Fumes and gases issuing from
these producers can be condensed
and the cyanide contents separated
thereof.

In the purification of coal gas by
hydrated iron oxide, large amounts
of cyanide are continually obtained;
this has been an old-time source of
supply.

The extension of the by-product
coke ovens, replacing the wasteful
bee-hive ovens, constitute an abund
ant source of nitrogen products from
which large quantities of cyanides
can be obtained.

The beet sugar industry is another
well-known source of cyanide which
is obtained as one of the by-products
by the treatment of residue vinasse.
Formerly most of the potassium
ferrocyanide from which other cy
anogen compounds were made was
obtained by fusion of dry refuse ani
mal matter at a red heat together
with potassium carbonate and iron
filings. About 3,000 tons of cyanides
were yearly produced by this me
thod. The scarcity of hoofs, horns and
scrap leather and the competition of
synthetic cyanides have relegated
this old method.

Cyanides can also be made from
atmospheric nitrogen, by synthesis
between carbon disulphide and am
monia; by ammonia, charcoal and
alkali and from sulphocyanides.
There are several hundred patents
(many of them in operation) which
have been applied for during the last
20 years relating to the preparation
of cyanides from carbides, from ni
trides, etc.

The enumeration of the more prac
tical methods for the preparation of
cyanides by these various methods
would be too long. Those brief notes
show plainly the abundance of ma
terials which we have within our
reach, to create an independent na
tional industry, which could not only
produce all the cyanide required to
supply our home industries, but also
to reverse our former trading prac
tice of importing cyanides by be
coming exporters of our excess of
production to other sections of our
continent, to Australasia, South Afri
ca and to the eastern gold-producing
countries.

“Shelby Cullom,” said a Springfield
veteran, “was a bad man to argue with.
“I argued with him once, on war. He
accused me of being weakened in my
principles. He said I reminded him of
old Cal Clay.
“He saw Cal rolling along home one
evening, he explained, full of apple
jack, and so he said to him:
‘Why, Cal, you told me once that
you were a teetotaler.’
‘So Ah is, Mahn Shelby,’ said old
Cal, ‘so Ah is; only, sah, Ah ain’t big
oted.’”
