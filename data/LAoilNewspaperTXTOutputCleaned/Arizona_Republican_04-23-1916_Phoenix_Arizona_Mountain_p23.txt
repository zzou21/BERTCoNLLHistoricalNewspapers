JOHN DEERE BINDERS

JOHN DEERE BINDERS are built for the man who
wants real visible quality. The binder is one of the more
important machines used on the farm, and a few dollars
in price is of no consequence when the saving of a crop is
a consideration. The difference between JOHN DEERE
BINDERS and other makes can be better appreciated by
a customer making a thorough investigation of the ma-
chine. We believe it will pay you to examine the JOHN
DEERE BINDER before buying.

LODGE

The Fraternal Brotherhood
There was a very fine attendance at
the Fraternal Brotherhood last night,
and during the lodge business session
several items of interest were disposed
of which promised good results for
the lodge in the future.
Several candidates rode the goat and
escaped without very serious damage.
After the business session was over a
good social time was enjoyed by all in
attendance.
All our friends are welcome at our
dance next Saturday night.
Knights of Columbus

As the first fruits of the membership
campaign now in progress, Marcos de
Niza council will give ten candidates
the honors of the first degree at the
regular meeting Tuesday evening in
Pythian hall. Grand Knight Peter
Ryan and the members of the degree
team are prepared to give the newcomers
the proper impression of the first step
to knighthood. Captains W. J. Burns
and J. Pat Lavin are hard at work on
the eligibles and will submit another
batch of applications at the next meet
ing. The lodge has about 20 members
at the present time and is increasing
every week. Important matters are
to be brought up that vitally concern
each member and all are urged to be
present at the initiation Tuesday even
ing to assist in the degree work. In
addition Lecturer Pat Getting is pre
paring a pleasing program for the soc
ial session.
Marcos de Niza council will be rep
resented at the state council in Tucson
on May 9 by Grand Knight Peter
Ryan and Past Grand Knight J. T.
Whitney, with Brothers P. C. Gettins
and W. P. Voita as alternates. Tucson
is preparing to take care of a large
number of visitors from all parts of
the state. It is probable that several
will make the trip from Phoenix by
auto. On May 8 the third degree will
be exemplified, and on the next day
the business session will be followed
by a banquet in the evening.
State Deputy J. H. Morgan, District
Deputy Frank J. Barry and represen
tatives of several councils will be in
Bisbee on May 7 for an exemplification
of the third degree. Marcos de Niza
members are cordially invited to be
present at the Bisbee degree. Several
will attend, returning to Tucson in
time for the state council session.
Trustees G. E. Wager and J. J. Cliff
ord have completed an audit of the
books of the treasurer and financial
secretary of Marcos de Niza council,
and satisfactory work was finished.
Brother C. J. McElroy has been in
Globe and Miami for the past two
weeks.
Brother McElroy has accepted a po
sition and will probably locate perma
nently.
Sunday, April 30, being the fifth
Sunday in the month, the members of
Marcos de Niza and visiting Knights
of Columbus will attend holy commu
nion in a body at the regular mass.
On April 1 the total membership of
the Knights of Columbus was 352,432,
of which number 240,614 are associ
ate and 111,838 are insurance.
Loyal Order of Moose
Tuesday evening's session was in
deed most enjoyable. As the days go
on and the new officers become more
at home in their several parts the in
terest in the degree work increases.
Since the advent of Brother Wilson,
the special deputy, there has been a
constant round of business to be
threshed out. There will be no let-up
in the weekly initiation after he goes
away. Past Dictator Boido is now
safely landed in his chair and he
revels in the luxury of a joyful non-
responsibility. He served the lodge
well and is entitled in more senses
than one to the position he now
occupies.
The members have each received
their quota of $5.00 worth of tickets
and few have been returned. There
will be two bumper crowds to see the
play "Are You a Moose?" at the Elks'
theater on Friday and Saturday of this
week.
Sunday, April 30th, the big show
will take place at Moose hall at 2 p. m.
Members are cordially invited to at
tend and bring friends with them,
friends of either sex.
It would be most pleasing to the
committee if some of the lady rela
tives of our members would bring
flowers and decorate the hall in honor
of the occasion.
The next important move is the es
tablishment of a "Ladies" Auxiliary to
the Loyal Order of Moose. All of the
brothers are enthused over the propo
sition and all that is needed is for
some of our ladies to take the initiative
and "go to it."
Brother Wilson will leave for Ray
on Monday in order to pave the way
for the revival of Moose-dom in that
town. He returns on the twenty-
seventh in order to put on the big
show.
Royal Neighbors
The R. N. A. Thimble club was roy
ally entertained Tuesday afternoon by
Neighbor Knauff, Sweitzman and
Thornton at the home of Mrs. Knauff.
After a short business meeting it
was decided to lay aside the usual
quilt making so as to give the "hens"
a chance to hunt Easter eggs that
had been hidden around in various
places. The "hen" finding the most
eggs and making the best cackle was
given a prize. Mrs. Kross was award
ed the prize.
After the cacklers were quieted they
were invited to the dining room where
dainty refreshments were served. The
table was beautifully decorated with
the R. N. A. colors, the centerpiece
being the five colors of the Graces.
The place cards and favors were
dainty Easter offerings. The club will
meet the second Tuesday in May with
Neighbor Miller at Alhambra.
