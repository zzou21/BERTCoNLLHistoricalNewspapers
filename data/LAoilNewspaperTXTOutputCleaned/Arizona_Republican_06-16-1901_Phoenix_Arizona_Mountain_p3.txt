IT WAS NO GO.

Redding, Cal., June 15. Mr. Wells,
one of the principal owners of the Palakala group of sixty copper claims in
Flat Creek district in this county, who
arrived here this morning, absolutely
denies the truth of the report to the
effect that the property has been sold
for $500,000 to Denver people, at the
head of whom was said to be ex-Governor
Grant.

The property owned by E. S. L. Jack
son and Willard Monding of this city,
in the Pidmosa mining district, contin
ues to improve with development work,
said one of the owners who was
in town yesterday. They are down now
180 feet on one claim and the showing
is most encouraging. The copper body
seems to be immensely large and sat
isfactorily rich. Operations have been
continuous till within a few days, but
work will be commenced again shortly.

"It is going to be a money maker,
say the owners.
Readers of The Republican have been
informed from time to time of the work
of dredging for gold on the lower Colo
rado near Yuma, a work that it is be
lieved will soon be brought to a suc
cessful demonstration. In fact the
dredgers are now preparing for a big
trial run. This work or work of the
same nature, is even further advanced
on the upper Colorado in Utah and re
garding it the Denver Times has this
to say: "E. W. Stanton, manager of
the eastern company operating placer
ground on the Colorado river in south
western Utah, passed through Denver
a few days ago on his way to New
York, and while here gave some inter
esting details concerning the big dredge
now in operation on the company's
property. He said that since the com
pletion of the dredge it has worked
without a hitch, and saves the gold in
quantities that amply justify the in
vestment. The river has been very
high this spring and the water conse
quently very badly roiled, but it
seems to have made little, if any, dif
ference in the output of the machine.
Mr. Stanton did not say what the re
sults of the operations had been beyond
the fact that the enterprise was a de
cided success, but said that his visit
to New York was for the purpose of
consulting with the directors of the
company regarding its future policy.
He said that he anticipated that the
company would order at least one new
dredge. The gold found in the river
sands is very fine and difficult to save
with the ordinary methods, but the
dredge makes a good saving and occa
sionally pay streaks are encountered in
which the gold is as large as fine shot.
Farther up some men are doing well
with rockers."
E. Rautman of Los Angeles is in
Prescott working up an interest in oil
matters with the hopes that a strong
company may be organized in Prescott
to take hold of the matter of prospect
ing for oil in the Mineral Point
country. Mr. Rautman is a well known
oil man of California and has great
hopes that matters may be so arranged
as to begin the work of boring for oil
in the near future. A committee of
citizens are working on the proposition
and definite information may be ob
tainable soon. Journal-Miner.
The Prospector says fifty carloads of
mining and smelter supplies have been
delivered at Naco during the past two
days, consigned to the Greene Consoli
dated Mining company.
L. D. Carter, the well known Colorado
mining expert, was in Yuma last week.
Mr. Carter has been at the Pothole
for some time, says the Sentinel, testing his new dry concentrating machine
on gold bearing gravel; the same
proved very satisfactory. He has se
cured options on a large tract of placer
ground and will this fall erect a large
plant for working the ground on a large
scale.
The Gold Cross mines at Hedges,
near Yuma, have been sold to some
New York parties for $2,000,000.
Speaking of recent operations on the
Blue Dick property in Yavapai county
the Journal-Miner says: "A. H. Kleisch
mann, who is working the Blue Dick
mine has been doing so in a very quiet
and unostentatious manner, and while
he may not be implicitly obeying the
scripture command not to let his left
hand know what his right hand is
doing, he certainly has not been mak
ing any great noise about his opera
tions, but has kept digging all the
time. The Blue Dick has always borne
a good reputation as a producer of
mineral and it is one of the Yavapai
properties on which no adverse criti
cism is heard from the professional
knocker and his near relative, the un
fortunate pessimist. While it has
never been worked on regular mining
principles, its former owners when in
need of funds always turned their at
tention to this mine and it never failed
to respond to their demands when
backed up by work. Mr. Kleischmann
has recently struck quite a large body
of very rich ore, assorted samples of
it giving a value of between $300 and
$1,000 per ton. After various experi
ments in treating the ore it has been
decided that it can be most success
fully treated by the smelting process,
and work is now in progress for its
construction, and it is expected to have
it in operation within the next sixty
days. Mr. Kleischmann recently pur
chased the New Year group of mines
in the McCabe district from H. K.
Uehm, and has already ordered a hoist
for the property, and as soon as it is
in place will commence active opera
tions in the development of the prop
erty. The property already has sev
eral hundred feet of development work
done on it, and nearly all of the open
ings are in good ore, giving promise of
adding another bullion producer to the
already quite respectable list in that
district."
W. D. Lude, superintendent of the
Castle Dome lead mines, was in town
this week. He informs us that the
mining outlook for Castle Dome mines
is very flattering and a large force
of men will be put to work shortly.
Yuma Sentinel.
A new industry is about to be started
in Gila county. C. E. Morgan recently
discovered a big guano deposit in a
cave about eighteen miles north of
Globe which he is arranging to ship to
Los Angeles, having obtained a rail
road rate of $10 per ton.

THE GARRETSON FURNACE

For Smelting Copper Ores Without
Fuel.

A new process for the reduction of
copper ores is now offered to the min
ing world and if it proves to do what
its inventor says it will it will not only
revolutionize the method of working
copper ores but make feasible the oper
ation of many mines that heretofore
could not be worked on a paying basis.
Speaking of this new process the Denver Times
says:
For several days past, a quiet man,
with the air of a scholar rather than
an investor, has been in Denver among
mining men making an investigation
regarding the copper resources of Colo
rado. He has said little about the ob
jects of his inquiries, but it has since
transpired that he was in touch with
a scheme which may mean a great deal
for the miners of this state who have
any considerable percentage of copper
in their ore.
His name is C. R. Davis, a metallurg
ist of New York, who represents a com
pany which has recently been organ
ized to prosecute the smelting of copper
by the process recently patented
by O. S. Garretson of Buffalo, N. Y.,
which is claimed will smelt ores
without fuel and produce pure copper
without conversion.
It is needless to say that if the new
process will do all that is claimed for
it there will be a revolution of the
methods now in use for the production
of metallic copper. Mr. Garretson's
company is capitalized at $5,000,000 and
proposes to erect a refinery at Niagara
Falls and copper furnaces all over the
country where ore conditions are suit
able. It is not known whether Mr.
Davis has decided in favor of the erec
tion of one of these furnaces in Colo
rado.
The furnace is constructed entirely
of copper and the cost of a plant ca
pable of treating 125 tons per day is
said to be not about $3,500. It con
sists of a water tight vertical shaft
not dissimilar from that of the ordinary
matte furnace. In the Garretson fur
nace, however, the use of fuel is abso
lutely unnecessary, the required heat
being generated by the combustion of
sulphur in the ore and oxidization of
the iron and matte. While the heated
gases arise from the hearth of the fur
nace, beginning the combustion of sul
phur in the upper portion of the furnace,
the mass of the charge keeps passing downward until it
reaches the great heat on top of the
slag. There the silica is converted into
slag by the action of the lime and the
iron contained in the ore or supplied
as flux.
The copper matte, as is well known,
sinks below the stratum of the slag
and here is where the value of the in
vention comes in. At this point there
are some extra tuyeres, delivering a
blast under pressure of 7,000 pounds to
the square inch on the molten matte
and a very intense oxidization develops
the heat necessary to convert the cop
per that is yet in a state of sulphide
into a metallic state. Thus there are
accomplished in one operation the
roasting, the matting and the reduction
of the copper to the metallic state.
One great point of value lies in the
fact that inasmuch as no fuel of any
kind is required it makes no difference
how inaccessible the mine may be, the
ore can be treated right there and con
verted into ingots ready for the refin
ing. Furnaces can also be built of a
size to accommodate the output of the
mine.
In the old method and up to the
building of the Garretson furnace the
only mode of extracting metal from the
ore required three separate processes.
First, the ore has to be roasted, which
is an expensive process. Then the
metal is extracted from the roasted
ore. Later, by still another process the
various metals are separated one from
the other. The entire treatment is ex
tremely expensive. By the use of Mr.
Garretson's furnace it is claimed the
expense is only one-tenth as great.
For many years efforts have been
made to produce a method by which
gold, silver, lead, copper and the vari
ous other metals which are found in
combination in low grade ores could be
cheaply extracted. The great expense
and imperfect separation under the old
systems have caused the abandonment
of many valuable mines which other
wise might have been worked with
profit and the invention of Mr. Gar
retson seems to be a long step in that
direction,
