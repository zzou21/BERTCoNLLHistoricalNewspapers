“Brightest sun from out the sky,
Brings the wrinkles round your eye.”
Very often persons suffering from eye
strain only notice a desire to close the
eyes when in a bright light, and that
frowning is frequently an unconscious
effort to see well. The special sense of
vision is almost as dear to us as life,
yet how frequently is the wonderful
eye abused by neglect or incompetency,
regardless of the delicacy of its struc-
ture. Much of the present day eye
troubles is due to this cause. I fit all
the most difficult and complicated eye
defects by the latest and most ap-
proved methods. Examination free.

Refreshing
Phosphates.
A good soda phosphate is
more than an ideal thirst
quencher it is a beverage of
actual medicinal value. It
stimulates digestion, nourishes
the nervous system and over-
comes fatigue.
Our phosphates are a little
different from and a little bet-
ter than the ordinary phos-
phates. Always cool, sparkling,
delicious and refreshing.

AFTER CATTLE. Baylor Shannon
of Clifton is here on a beef buying trip.
Mr. Shannon now supplies his Clifton
market almost entirely with beef from
this valley. In fact, this valley now
has about all the fat cattle left in
southern Arizona from common report.

WHISKEY’S INNINGS The Tomb-
stone Prospector says: Last night
Tombstone had just recovered from a
two days’ siege of water famine caused
by a break on the main line and, the
repair made, a small supply was re-
ceived when another accident was an-
nounced today and the supply again
shut off until the break is repaired.

A TRUTHFUL MAN Dick Wick
Hall of Wickenburg is the most truth-
ful man in that camp, said a lady who
came down from there yesterday. The
result of drinking Hassayampa water
is well known, and that is the only
kind of water in Wickenburg. If Dick
is so outrageously truthful it is easy to
determine what he does not drink.

MORTALITY AMONG HORSES.
Persons coming into the city overland
from the north report the finding of
many dead horses in the neighborhood
of the Arizona canal. Those who have
not stopped to examine them imagine
that an equine epidemic has broken
out in that neighborhood, but a closer
examination shows that they have been
shot. The horses come from the ranges
in the mountains on the north to the
canal after water. They tear down
fences in order to get to the canal, and
sometimes break into fields and lay
waste the crops.

CHAUNCEY CLARKE HURT. A
Peoria, Ill., paper has the following to
say regarding Chauncey D. Clarke, well
known in this city. “Last evening Col-
onel Fred Smith and Mr. Chauncey
Clarke were returning from the Coun-
try club when their conveyance collid-
ed with a street car, badly wrecking it
and throwing the two gentlemen out.
Mr. Smith was very slightly bruised,
but Mr. Clarke sustained more serious
injuries, fainting away after being con-
veyed to the house of his brother, Sum-
ner Clarke. This morning Mr. Clarke
was comfortable and no more serious
results are anticipated from the acci-
dent than a few bruises.”

CHARLES SEYMOUR DEAD.
Charles Seymour died at the Sisters’
hospital about 10 o’clock Wednesday
night. He was a Canadian by birth,
about thirty-five years old, and his
relatives reside in Strathroy, Ontario.
He was a member of an Odd Fellows’
lodge in Seattle, which has been in-
formed of his death. Unless otherwise
requested by the lodge or his relatives
the funeral will be held this afternoon
at 5 o’clock at the undertaking parlors
of A. J. Bradley. Mr. Seymour has
been a citizen of this country for some
time, and was a blue jacket in Dewey’s
fleet at the battle of Manila. His ser-
vice ended in failing health and he was
given an appointment aboard a gov-
ernment vessel fitted out by Professor
Agassiz for a year’s cruise in the South
Sea islands for scientific purposes. Dur-
ing that voyage a mast fell on him,
injuring his lungs and resulting later
in the contraction of tuberculosis, for
which he came here some months ago.

THE REFORM SCHOOL. G. H.
Gallagher returned yesterday morning
from Benson, where he went to look
after the progress of work on the Re-
form school building. He says all the
outside work is done except the finish-
ing touches on the roof by the tinner,
and a force of men is at work on the
inside. The building will be complet-
ed between the 10th and 15th of Sep-
tember. The contractors are proud of
their work and take pleasure in invit-
ing everybody to inspect it.

NOW FOR OIL. J. E. Breitwiser re-
turned from Los Angeles yesterday
morning, having sent an experienced
driller here the day before. Both spent
yesterday in the Camelback district,
and will today get the machinery all
in place so that drilling will commence
either Saturday or Monday. All pre-
liminaries are arranged and there is
nothing to do but bore. It will proba-
bly be settled very shortly whether the
Camelback field is an oil district or a
delusion and a snare.

THE COBRE GRANDE SUIT. At-
torneys J. M. Jamison and Paul Ingles
left this morning for Prescott to
attend the suit of Axel W. Hallenborg
against W. C. Greene and others in his
application for a receiver for the Cobre
Grande company, which will shortly
come up before Judge Sloan. This is
the suit of which mention was made
in a New York dispatch printed in The
Republican yesterday. It was errone-
ously stated in that dispatch that a
New York attorney was on his way to
Phoenix to make application for the
appointment of a receiver. As a matter
of fact the application had already been
made at Prescott. Messrs. Jamison and
Ingles represent the applicant. Mr. L.
H. Chalmers and Messrs. Baker and
Bennett, who are already at Prescott,
are on the other side.

BOYS LOCATED. Marshal Kinney
received a letter yesterday from a con-
stable in San Bernardino, saying he
had two boys, Alfred Coy and Jesse
Garner, in jail on the charge of vag-
rancy. They told him they were from
Phoenix, where they had friends, and
he desired to prove their story. The
two boys named left here contempora-
neously with the “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”
tent show three months ago, and for a
time it was believed they had followed
it away. Before leaving they secured
wheels of H. S. Griswold, and they
went by the northern route, as one of
the wheels was sold in Wickenburg.
Alfred’s father resides in the country
near here, and after the departure of
the boys, who are only about fourteen
years old, he settled with Mr. Griswold
for the wheel taken by his son. The
marshal will advise Mr. Coy of his
son’s whereabouts, and the boys, no
doubt having had their fun roughing
it, will be glad to return home.

TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN.
A few days ago the weather observer
of The Republican, and any one may
observe the weather, announced to the
anxious people of this vicinity that the
summer rains were at hand. That pre-
diction was based on the steady
growth of the thunder head.

They continued to increase just as
the weather observer said they would
up to a certain point, and then they
stopped, went back and finally disap-
peared altogether. All the time the
humidity of this neighborhood kept in-
creasing, until day before yesterday it
had risen to 42 per cent. Yesterday it
dropped back to 24 per cent, and it
looked as if the annual rainy season
had been postponed until the summer
of 1903. But in the afternoon the thun-
der heads began to come to the surface
again, and now they are about at the
same stage of development they were
a week ago. It is now hoped, but not
predicted, that something will come of
them.

DELINQUENT TAX SALE.
Final Act in the Adoption of Bennett
Addition by the City.
On the 19th City Tax Collector Luke
will sell at the city hall all property in
the Bennett addition on which the city
taxes for last year are delinquent.
This will be the final act in the drama
that began with the move to force the
addition into the city.
The suit for that purpose was com-
promised by an agreement that for a
certain length of time the addition
should not be taxed by the city, and
should not ask the city to keep the
streets in repair. But the assessor
could find no legal authority for neg-
lecting to tax the addition, so he taxed
it the same as the rest of the city.
Some of the property owners refused
to pay the taxes, and enjoined the city
from selling the property.
The suit was tried and decided in
favor of the city, the court holding
that if it was any part of the corpora-
tion at all it was a full-fledged part.
Advertisement of the tax sale was
again made, and the time will be up
on the 19th. At the last meeting of
the council a bill presented by Guy
Bennett for keeping the streets in or-
der during this time, and amounting to
$71.75, was allowed and paid on the
ground that if the addition had to pay
the taxes it was entitled to the bene-
fits of taxation. The amount of the
bill was applied on the delinquent tax-
es, so it is estimated that the total
amount of taxes yet due will not ex-
ceed $800.

HER LIFE’S WORK ENDED.
Mrs. J. Frank Elwell Died at the Sis-
ters’ Hospital Yesterday.
Mrs. J. Frank Elwell died yesterday
afternoon about 3:30 o’clock at the Sis-
ters’ hospital following an operation
performed the day before, and of which
mention was made yesterday morning.
The operation was performed as a last
hope for the saving of her life and the
conditions found were more complicat-
ed than could have been previously im-
agined. It would have been impossible
for her to have lived but a very few
days without it, perhaps no longer than
she did live, and it was undertaken at
her earnest request.
She rallied so well and was so cheer-
ful afterward that those at her bed-
side were greatly encouraged to be-
lieve on Wednesday night that her re-
covery was assured. Toward morning
she was worse for a short time, but
again rallied and seemed to be doing
nicely till within an hour before she
died. She was conscious most of the
time and appeared to be in a cheerful
and hopeful spirit till the approach of
the final sinking spell, but the tax upon
her strength had been too severe. Her
remarkable bravery and Christian forti-
tude both before and after the opera-
tion were commented upon by the phy-
sicians and nurses and all who were in
attendance during her final hours.
Mrs. Elwell was a native of New Jer-
sey and her mother now resides in
Camden. She came here with her hus-
band ten years ago last month, since
when she has formed a wide acquaint-
ance. Her cheerful spirit and her
Christian character have made a
strong impression and been a lasting
influence for good on all who had the
pleasure of her acquaintance, and her
charitable ministrations have called
upon her the silent blessings of many.
Besides a mourning husband, whose
devotion was unremitting, and her
mother in the east, she leaves no im-
mediate relatives except a brother en-
gaged in a wholesale business in Mon-
treal. A sister enlisted in the Red
Cross work during the Spanish-Ameri-
can war and died in Cuba in the per-
formance of her duty.
The funeral service will be held Sat-
urday morning at 9 o’clock in the Bap-
tist church and will be conducted by
her pastor, Rev. Dr. Halsey. She joined
the Baptist church in the east many
years ago, and during her residence
here she has been one of the most faith-
ful and energetic members of the con-
gregation, ever willing to do her full
part and more, ever interesting herself
in the happiness and welfare of those
around her, and ever reflecting the sub-
limest virtues of a Christian life.

LOWER RATES.
To the Two Western Congresses Agreed
Upon.
Colorado Springs, Col., July 17.—At
today’s session of the Transcontinental
Passenger association lower rates were
adopted for the national irrigation con-
gress which is to be held in this city
from October 6th to 9th. A general rate
was made from all points in California,
Nevada, Washington and Oregon to
Colorado Springs, one fare for the
round trip, the rate being open to the
general public as well as to delegates.
From Chicago and Missouri river points
a rate of one fare plus $2 will be made.
For the Trans-Mississippi congress to
be held in St. Paul in October the same
rate will be granted from the four
states above mentioned.
