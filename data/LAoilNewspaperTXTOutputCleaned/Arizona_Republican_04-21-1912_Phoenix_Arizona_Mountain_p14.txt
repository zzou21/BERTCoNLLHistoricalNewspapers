a long list of telegrams to be sent
along the line and other discomfit
ures that are the usual fate of newly
weds. They had failed to take in
account the cleverness of their vic
tims, who left their train at Glendale,
motored back to town and
passed the week at their country
home, where they are now estab
lished until the first of July, when
they leave for an extensive tour of
the east.
Every time word is received of Lee
Perkins it is of his advancement in
his profession. He is at present con
nected with a railroad, and his head
quarters are in Globe. Recently he
was made a member of the American
Engineers' association, an honorary
society to which only the most skill
ful engineers of the country are
elected.
The Charles Edwin De Munds are
building a beautiful home out in
fashionable West End, Los Angeles.
They will entertain quite a bit this
fall on their return from a summer
at their ranch in northern Portland.
Mr. De Mund has visited here fre
quently since his departure two years
ago, but Mrs. De Mund has never re
turned. She has been actively en
gaged in club work in Los Angeles
and has been unable to time her visit
to Phoenix without the event con
flicting with some important club af
fair on the coast. She is a member
of the Ebell club and prominently
identified with the Sunshine society,
to which she has generously con
tributed five thousand dollars.

Readers who have been following
events in China will find a hint in
George Bronson Howard's story in
the May Smart Set that will help to
explain the sources of some of the
periodic anti-foreign outbreaks there,
and the part a tactful man in author
ity can play toward smoothing over
such disturbances.

Do you think Broadway theatrical
managers don't know acting when
they see it? Do you find it hard
to get past the outer office? Mildred
Grantley couldn't convince a
manager that she was good for any
thing above "the road" until she
joined with a friend in a plan to
humble a certain proud society lead
er and did the best acting of her
career. In Leroy Scott's story, "In
Borrowed Plumes," in the May issue
of the Smart Set, the whole scheme
is worked out, and Miss Grantley be
comes the most sought-after actress
in New York.

RANCH

LANDS

Have been sold during the past few months nearly all of which has
been purchased by California ranchers and fruit growers, who are sell
ing out in the choicest sections of California and buying Chandler
ranch lands. We do not need to say any more. This fact alone proves
that Chandler ranch lands are the best buy in the southwest. All of
this land has been sold surrounding the new townsite of Chandler. More
sales are being made every day. Not a lot has been sold yet but they
will soon be offered for sale, if you are looking for a location in any
line of business it will pay you to investigate at once. Street and ce
ment work is now being done; a two story concrete and brick hotel and
store buildings will soon be erected and other improvements made,
making Chandler one of the best towns in this rich agricultural section
surrounded by busy mining regions. ALFALFA, FRUIT AND OR
ANGE LAND, $100 to $150 an acre. TEN YEARS' TIME. Visit the
ranch and see for yourself or send for illustrated booklets.
