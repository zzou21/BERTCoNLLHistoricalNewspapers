Ramsey, a new pitcher, worked out
for a while and showed some good
stuff. He will not work however this
afternoon unless posted. Bill, tilling
that doesn't happen in the
category of events in Busted Bill's
catalogue. He will be there like
Mary, "with his hair in a braid."
There is a new voice from the
press stand noticed lately. It is said
to belong to one Slivers, who is some
hand at that. Last Thursday he took
a notion to root for the umpire, and
his efforts were so much appreciated
that several rows of ivories were
shown from behind the pitcher's box,
indicating that "hizzumps" was smiling
back at the compliments. Slivers
will be on hand this afternoon and
root some more. He has not
announced yet which he will root for, but
it will be some rooting for all that.
The grand stand has been cleaned,
there will be cushions to be had at
the stand, the game promises to be a
fast one, and with a great crowd of
fans and a good afternoon it will
be pleasant to go down to the ball
park and take in the game.

The two local baseball teams
known among the fans as the regulars and the natives will clash at

the local diamond this afternoon
at 3:30 sharp. The game means
something to both sides. If the
regulars win they will start climbing
and when Tempe comes over
next Thursday they will take

the worthies into camp. If the Maroons
win it means a breakup in their
usual duck egg average. These two
things alone make a strong fighting
game from the call of the umpire to
the end of the session. The work
of the Indians is always good. They
put up a fighting game from the beginning to the end. It is true that
luck has been breaking against them
in the last few games which they
really deserved to win, but luck is
luck and that's about all.
Talking about luck the regulars
have been having a little of that article of late. They won two games
in a row in good shape and looked
awful good to lead the league when
they went down to Mesa little suspecting that there was a good-twirl
person down there who has a habit
of breaking up exhibitions of the
national pastime. But never mind.
The next game they will win.
There will be a great crowd out to
the game this afternoon. The local
fans support the home team in good
shape now, and they like the way the
little Maroons fight for a game. This
sort of baseball always attracts and
the gate receipts show a big increase
with every game.

Both teams wore out yesterday

afternoon and put in a good hour practicing.
The Maroons used Churchill
field, one of the old time playing
parks of the community, while the
Phoenix team went down to the new
park and worked out in fine style.

SAN FRANCISCO, August 16. Pitcher Ed
Kelly, who has been sold to the
Boston Americans by the Seattle
Northwestern League club to report
in spring, is a Boston youth who
has been living in Spokane. Kelly

joined the Seattle team two weeks
ago. He was bought from the

Walla Walla team, of the Western
Tri-State League, for $300. He has
won three out of five games pitched
for Seattle and last Sunday he made
such a remarkable showing against
the Senators that President Pugdale, of
the Seattle club, feared Kelly would
be traded, and he began negotiations
with Boston to beat the draft. Before
Kelly joined the Walla Walla team
he pitched for the City League of
Spokane.

CHICAGO, Aug. 16. Batters in the
major leagues today made thirteen
home runs, eleven in the National
and two in the American. Nearly all
these hits were made with men on

bases but not alone were they the
deciding factor in any game. Jackson

and Chapman of Cleveland took the
honors in the American league. In
the National: Broth of Cincinnati,
Wagner of Pittsburgh, Shafer of New
York, Archer, Schulte and Zimmerman (two) of Chicago; Stengel,
Fischer and Fisher (two) of Brooklyn.

"The elements can be made to serve
a useful purpose," remarked the philosopher. "Yes, if one casts bread upon the
waters and throws care to the winds."

TEMPLE, August 16. Following a
week of hard practice, fielding and
batting intermixed to the capacity of
every player each evening, Tempe is
in its prime to take on the Mesa,
Highlanders in tomorrow's game at
the local park. Enthusiasm over the
contest is at its height, fans and
players alike are worked up to the
highest pitch and all will play their
respective positions at the park tomorrow and will work as one toward
local victory.
From the camp of the enemy seven
miles up the river comes a similar
cry. And in one respect they have
got it on Tempe, it comes that they
have a new pitcher, recently imported, who has been working out nightly in anticipation of this afternoon's
contest. He goes by the name of
Stovell, is the report, and backs his
reputation with spitters, curves, both
in and out, and straight balls in the
weak spot enough to get the best of

But that is just what the
regulars like, against a real pitcher and
a hard game is just when the
regulars put up such an exhibition as
gives them a right to be contenders

for state champions.
Today's lineup is strictly the best
available and with Spikes, Tempe's
Mar twirler, working on the mound,
big things are being looked for.
Spikes holds the reputation of never
having been replaced in the box in
his life. True, he has been beaten
once or twice by the Mesa Highland
ers, but today he is in his prime
and prepared to work his hardest to
keep Tempe at the head of the Salt
River Valley League.
Behind him, Spikes will have that
invincible fielding team. Nutt, the
Kansas catcher, will be there at his
best. And beside his work at guessing the weak spots he is some hitter.
He has a Myder hat in mind, one
that will be given in today's game.
At the initial sack will be Griffen.
Hudson, of home-run fame and always to be relied upon at the bat
when a run or two are needed, will
hold out at the middle turn. Mullen
batting third in the lineup today
looks like a sure thing with two big
stickers preceding him. Captain Mullen will be stationed at the third
station. Mullen since the early part
of the season has been playing out
field but with the retirement to ranch
life of the regular third sticker his
chance has loomed up, and he has
made good. It takes some hit placer

Ted Meredith (left) and C
NEW YORK, Aug. 10. (Special) decade,"
Not in many years has so much atten- , Create r

in competition, but a number of the
best of the foreigners who took part
in the Olympic games. These men
include Sanristo, the Finn, whose javelin throwing was conceded to be the
most marvelous ever witnessed; Hans
Bruun, the German middle distance
runner who followed Sheppard and
Meredith over half of Europe and finally up into Scotland to prove that he
was the best man; W. R. Applegarth,
the English champion sprinter, and
probably the greatest distance runner
of all time; Jean Pouin of France, who
recently ran nearly twelve miles in an
hour, breaking the world's record; and
Taipale, the discus expert, whose best
efforts completely smothered the work
of the Americans and the men of other
nations who competed against him.
One of the best records of the books
today is that of Maxey Pong, former
Columbia University and New York A.
C. short distance runner, whose forty
seven seconds for a straightway quarter of a mile has stood unapproached
since it was made in 1900 at the Out
tenberg racetrack. But at last American
athletics has produced a man in
the person of C. P. Haff of Michigan,
the present champion 440-yard man of
America, both A. A. U. and inter-collegiate,
whose recent grand running at
Boston and Chicago, when he annexed
both titles in convincing fashion, appears to give him a preeminent right to
make a successful essay at the long
standing mark.
Others who are expected to accompany Haff on his long swing down the
quarter stretch of the Empire City
track are Ted Meredith, the Olympic
champion at both 400 metres and 800
metres; Tom Halpin, the Bostonian,
who was the runnerup to Haff in the
Amateur Union championships in Chicago during the early part of the
month; V. V. Wilkie, the Yale lad, who
took all the Crimson quarter-milers
into camp at the dual games between
Yale and Harvard, and several others
of like calibre.

It was Overall's first appearance for
