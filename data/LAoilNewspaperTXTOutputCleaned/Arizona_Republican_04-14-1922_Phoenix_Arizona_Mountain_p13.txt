RIDE DOWN TRIP TO
CONVENTION HERE
For several weeks Director General Rountree and the executive officers
of the United States Good Roads association and Bankhead National
Highway association have been endeavoring to induce the transcontinental
railroads throughout the country to make a special rate to the
members, delegates and visitors to the United States Good Roads
convention and if possible to advance the date of their summer rate to the
west, from May 15 to April 15.
The best rate that has been or could be secured for the delegates
and visitors is one and one-half fare.
Director General Rountree is in receipt of the following telegram from
E. L. Beavington, chairman of the
transcontinental passenger association, dated April 12:
"All lines west of Chicago, St.
Louis, Memphis, New Orleans have
authorized rate fare and one-half,
certificate plan, to the United States
Good Roads convention; certificate
showing purchase going; tickets
April 17 to 23 will be honored for
reduced rate tickets if presented not
later than May 10.”
Notice has been sent to all the del
egates in this territory requesting
them to secure certificates of their
attendance so that they can secure
the reduced rates returning to their
homes. It is hoped by the extension
of the tickets until May 10 that many
delegates will come who would not
otherwise.
The United States Good Roads as
sociation, Bankhead National High
way association and the United
States Good Roads show have been
well advertised in all parts of the
East. The only drawback there is, is
the extension of time of tickets by
the railroads as many of the members,
delegates and visitors that are
coming to the convention desire to
stay longer than 10 days or two
weeks after the convention. Many of
them are coming not only to attend
the convention but to see Arizona
and the West.
Information received at the head
quarters of the United States Good
Roads association is that a number
of exhibitors have already shipped
their trucks, tractors, machinery and
material that they expect to exhibit
at the United States Good Roads
show, these exhibits will arrive dur
ing the week when they will be in
stalled at the Arizona state fair
grounds, where the show will be
given, all meetings held and every
thing free to the public.
The committee from the chamber of
commerce and Maricopa county on
convention and exhibit hall, consist
ing of Messrs. John Montgomery, G.
R. Bradshaw, Guy Vernon and S. J.
Ross is arranging the details in re
gard to booths, decorations, speakers’
stand and comfort of the delegates
and visitors at the convention. They
also have charge of the management
of the cowboy roundup which will
be given every afternoon under the
management of Cheyenne Kiser.
It is expected that this feature of
the entertainment will be quite
unique and enjoyable to those who
have never seen a western cowboy
roundup.
Delegates that have been appointed
by Governor Campbell, chambers of
commerce and civic organizations are
requested to send in their acceptance
to the United States Good Roads as
sociation, P. O. Box 1389, at once, so
that they can be properly enrolled
as delegates. All delegates are ex
pected to call at the Hotel Adams on
the morning of April 24 and secure
badges, delegates’ certificates, pro
grams and full information and be
ready to take part in the automobile
parade through the streets on the
afternoon of April 24 and also attend
the opening night of the convention.

Pioneers Visit Chandler
Many of the pioneers who were
attending the reunion held in Phoe
nix, April 11 and 12, visited Chandler
Wednesday. Most of them were very
much impressed with the great
change that has taken place in this

early days.
J. B. Dunn improving

desert east of town some time ago for
his health, is reported by Mrs. Dunn

trip. He is shipping hundreds of
cases of eggs to Tucson every week.

FINANCIAL AND MARKET NEWS

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market
[Republican A. P. Leased Wire]
NEW YORK, April 13.—Business
on the stock exchange today passed
the million share line for the tenth
consecutive full session, but failed by
a liberal margin to reach the more
impressive dimensions of recent days.
Tomorrow's recess (Good Friday)
prompted additional selling to insure
profits. This tendency was most
manifest in the more representative
steels, equipments, motors and for
eign oils, the latter giving evidence
of renewed liquidation.
Domestic oils, notably the Standard
Oils of New Jersey and California,
were among the strongest issues, with
Sinclair, Cosden, Pacific, Associated,
and Tidewater. Extreme advances in
this division ranged from two to
eight points. Rails were favored to
a greater degree than any previous
session of the week. Gains of one to
two points accompanied the buying
of Pacifies, Grangers, Coalers and
Trunk lines, but the common and
preferred issues of Gulf, Mobile and
Northern led that entire division with
extreme gains of four and six points.
Tobacco and food specialties, also
textiles and leathers, notably Tobacco
Products, Loose Wiles, Jewel Tea,
preferred; American Woolen, Ameri
can Hide and Leather, preferred;
and the secondary automobile issues,
particularly Pierce Arrow, common
and preferred, made substantial
contributions to the market’s con
servative side. Sales amounted to
1,375,000 shares.
Again eliminating the coal strike
which threatened to become an ad
verse factor of increasing impor
tance, the day’s general news was
distinctly encouraging. Before the
opening of the market, cables an
nounced the cut in the Bank of Eng
land discount rate to the lowest level
since July, 1914.
This evidence of international
monetary ease was followed by fur
ther relaxation of rates at this cen
ter. Call loans opened at 4 per cent,
that figure applying to renewals into
next week. In private negotiations,
however, demand money was obtain
able at 3% and even 3% per cent on
approved collateral.
Contrary to expectations, foreign
exchanges were not perceptibly re
sponsive to the lower British bank
rate. Sterling eased a fraction from
yesterday’s high quotations and few
of the continental remittances showed
more than nominal changes from the
previous day.
CHICAGO BOARD
CHICAGO, April 13— Big export
business helped bring about a sharp
advance today in the price of wheat.
The market closed strong 2% to 3% net higher, with May 1.33% to 1.34,
and July 1.23% to 1.23%. Corn
gained % to %, and oats %#% to
%#%. In provisions the outcome
was unchanged to 10 cents lower.
European purchases of wheat today
were estimated 1,100,000, including
1,000,000 bushels of new wheat. The
fact that tomorrow will be a holiday
with all grain exchanges, foreign and
domestic, remaining closed, was a
further influence toward an upturn
in the market, inasmuch as many
speculators who had been on the
selling side were apparently unwill
ing to take the risk of possible sur
prise developments before Monday
with only a brief time on Saturday
for any needed protection obtainable
through buying.
Reports of thousands of acres of
wheat drowned out by floods in the
midwest were given a good deal
of attention among traders, and as
a bullish factor were supplemented
by continued unfavorable crop ad
vices from sections of the southwest,
especially the western third of Kan
sas. Higher quotations at Liverpool
counted also as a stimulus to buyers,
notably during the initial dealings
here.
Action of the corn market and the
oats market showed sympathy with
the wheat advance. Cash demand,
however, for the feed grains proved
slow.
Downturns in the value of hogs
had a depressing effect on provision
values.
