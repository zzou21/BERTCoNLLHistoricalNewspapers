Some "beast" having plastered on the
cage holding a fine Gila Monster dis
played at my front door, the vile align
ment, that "he and Ford, belong to the
same family," I hereby take this method
to repudiate, and offer comparison. I
walk erect, he opposite. Ford's head,
oblong; his, flat; Ford has no hiero
glyphics on back; he, a ringed tail.
Ford's belly has a healthy tint; his, a
pale skin. My line, Ford has long grasp
ing claws; he, short, stubby ones. Ford
has a small mouth, closed only during

ously. Ford has a solid tongue; he, a
forked one. Ford, only hisses when his
enemies appear; he, hisses on all oc
casions. Ford, only bites, lovingly; he,
bites viciously. Our dispositions are
similar but resemble only slight. The
meanness of some people is actually
beyond expression. Ford, a "Gila Mon
