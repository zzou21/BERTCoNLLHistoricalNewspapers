store at the corner of First avenue and
Adams street will be open till 9 p. m.
We will continue this through the hot
months. In connection we wish to
state that the salespeople in our em
ploy are not being worked overtime.
We believe that six o'clock closing
during the hot months shuts off the
coolest hours for shopping, so have
added extra salespeople for this pur
pose. No goods will be delivered after
six o'clock. All orders after six will go
out the following morning.

FAST BOY GOOD
TEMPE, July 14. One of the news
papers of Olympia, Wash., has the fol
lowing: “Hegi, new man in Olympia
uniform, showed all sorts of speed on
bases and hits the ball hard,” which
would be construed as his having made
good on the team. The box score on
this certain day shows he did not get
a hit, but scored two runs. He played
right field, made one put-out and no
errors. Ernest Hegi is without a doubt
a coming ball player, with the proper
coaching and environment.

Peck Has New Oldsmobile
Frank Peck has purchased a new

before long.

nounce that commencing next Tuesday

regular route every five days and re
quests that everybody have their gar
bage prepared for removal in accord
ance with the ordinance governing
same.
“Fifty-Fifty”
This is a story of a girl who circu
lates in a frolic-seeking set of Bo
hemians in New York. After several
very trying experiences and the reali
zation of the artificialities of her mode
of life she settles down and marries.
But after a few years of married bliss
her husband’s fondness for gayety and
night revels almost wrecks her happi
ness forever. The climax comes when
he brings suit for divorce and offers
perjured testimony to discredit his
wife’s reputation. He also fights for
the custody of their child, but the suf
fering wife startles the court and spec
tators with the declaration that her
husband is not the child’s father. The
judge, however, suspects that this is
not true, and eventually after the
“other woman” in the case shows her
true colors, the husband and wife are
reunited. See this photoplay at the
Goodwin Airdome tonight together
with third installment of Helen Holmes
in “The Railroad Raiders.”
Returns from Hunt
W. L. Carpenter, manager of the
Tempe Garage Co., came down last
Thursday evening with J. C. Chilson
from the Mogollon mountains where
he has been on a hunting trip. He got
two bears and a mountain lion as part
of the game.
Returns to Chandler
Miss Jessie Dickinson yesterday re
turned to Chandler after having spent
the day and previous evening in Tempe
and Phoenix, visiting and shopping.
Case Dismissed
The case against G. R. Finch in the
justice court yesterday morning was
dismissed. The history of the case is
short. Two years ago Finch’s team
was stolen. He corresponded with par
ties here and during the past week got
the horses together with the harness.
He then advertised the find in the Re
publican and during the past week the
man from whom the horses were found
brought suit to recover the value of
the horses acknowledging that the
team was the same as that which
Finch lost. Finch widely advertised the
affair, and spent about $50 trying to
locate the stolen property. Now, after
two years, the party asks for the value
of the horse.
Red Cross Committee
Mesdames C. C. Woolf, C. H. Prather,
R. B. Moeur and O’Connor, motored to
Phoenix yesterday afternoon to inspect
the sewing work of the Phoenix Red
Cross with a view to determining the
nature of the Red Cross work to be
undertaken by the local branch. They
will also visit the Mesa chapter next
Wednesday when they meet, and ask
them to make recommendations.

MESA FARMER HIT
BY DOUBLE LOSS

MESA, July 14. J. H. Ruse, a ranch
er, had a double dose of hard luck on
Thursday of this week. First, he be
came overheated while driving a culti
vator and fell from the seat in a faint
ing condition, and since misfortunes
never come singly, a fine horse belong
ing to the team, for which he recently
paid $515, was cut in some way, pre
sumably by a wire and though a veter
inarian was called in the animal bled
to death. There was no barbed wire
used on the fencing of the Ruse ranch,
making it hard to account for the
wound.
Cantaloupe Returns
Returns have been received on two or
three cars of cantaloupes shipped out
from Mesa and they do not indicate the
exceptionally good profit of last sea
son. While it is impossible to forecast
the season’s prices by this return on
the small amount mentioned, yet grow
ers say that the late California crop is
hurting the sale of valley melons. The
Imperial crop was quite late, and in
fact has not ceased entirely and
since the local crop was almost on time,
the two sections came too close to
gether.
Californian Enjoys Weather
R. McNamara, a partner in The Tog
gery, is in Mesa to stay while George
Johnson goes east on a buying trip.
Mr. McNamara’s home is in Los Ange
les and yesterday during the hottest
part of the afternoon he so far forgot
his boosting proclivities as to suggest
that it was warm. Being reminded that
this was our own particular growing
season, the Los Angeles product
grinned and said “Sure, it’s fine weath
er, but let’s have a root beer anyway.”
The Rifles
Mesa men recently bought 200 Krags
and then after the border situation
settled down and there seemed no prob
ability of a raid from that direction,
Mesa almost forgot about the guns.
Now, following the report from Globe
that a plot had been discovered, hav
ing for its aim the destruction of the
valley’s crops, Mesa’s men thought of
these same rifles and more than one
expressed himself quietly, yet grimly,
that anybody bothering the peace and
quiet of the ranch life of this section
would find a warm reception already
prepared.
Pleasant Remembrance
Yesterday the local force of the
Mountain States Telephone company
made themselves and Mrs. E. R. Mil
ler, operator for the Western Union,
happy, the first in extending and the
second in the reception of a big box of
candy. The occasion was the birthday
of Mrs. Miller, and it fell on the thirty
seventh year of her work for the West
ern Union. The quiet, unassuming lit
tle woman has given to Mesa two years
of steady service without missing a
day. She now is entitled to her pension
from the telegraph company, but is
loath to give up active work.
Shower for Bride
On Thursday evening a pleasant sur
prise was given to Mrs. Frank Riggs.
It occurred at the home of Mrs. Henry
Vance and came in the form of a shower
with many kind little remembrances
falling to the lot of the bride.
Newly Weds at Home
Mr. and Mrs. Bradshaw are now at
home after a short wedding trip. 
For the present they are at the home
of the groom’s parents on a ranch near
Mesa.
Heat Struck
Bradford Bird, a resident of Mesa,
was in a critical condition for a while
Thursday, the result of being overcome
by the heat. Mr. Bird, who is
around 60 years of age, had worked
severely the day before and was in a
weakened condition prior to the at
tack.
Bride and Groom Return
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Lesueur have re
turned from their wedding journey,
during which they had a delightful
tour through southern California. In
Los Angeles Mr. Lesueur secured a car
and the couple drove to San Diego, Tia
Juana and various other points of in
terest in the Golden state. Mr. and
Mrs. Lesueur will be at home to their
many friends at the residence of the
groom’s parents during the latter’s ab
sence on a vacation.
Moving Into Town
Mr. and Mrs. Heineman are moving
back into the residence formerly oc
cupied by them at 156 South Sirrine
street. Only a short while ago they
moved to a ranch southwest of town,
but finding they could not get a tele
phone there, were compelled to return.
Mr. Heineman is a hay buyer and
naturally found it impossible to do
without this modern necessity.
Today’s Theater Programs

edy “The Revue of 1916” and a Key

Frank Lumbley and family are in

den before returning to Mesa.
J. D. Robertson III
J. D. Robertson, proprietor of the
Crescent Drug store, was confined at
home yesterday after a rather serious
attack of acute indigestion the night
before.
