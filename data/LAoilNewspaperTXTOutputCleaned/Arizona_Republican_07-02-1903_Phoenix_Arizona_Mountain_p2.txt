Russia and the United States.
It is regrettable, of course, that
American sympathy for oppressed
Russian Jews and protests against the
Kishineff outrages have caused a cool
ness to spring up between the Russian
bear and the American Eagle, but the
incident should not be regarded too se
riously, even should diplomatic relations
be broken off temporarily. That

Tomorrow, it will be found that do
mestic tariffs, brought into existence
by the exigencies of politics or what
not, have rent asunder the brotherly
nationalities of yesterday. As Russia's
greatest statesman, M. De Witte, said
only a few days ago, "Politically, Rus
sia and the United States are the best
of friends; commercially, they are at
war, because they have little in com
mon. Each of them is a great producer
of raw materials, and it unfortunately
happens that each nation produces the
same staples to a large degree; hence
they have little occasion to buy from
each other."

And when there is a war of commerce
between two countries, sentimental
and imaginative friendships are brushed
aside like chaff. Should Ambassador
Cassini leave Washington in a huff

for good, as he has threatened, there
would be no occasion for any American
to lose a minute of sleep.

Two Secrets of Success
The success of The Mutual
Life Insurance Company of
New York is due

First To its selection of
risks :
It writes no insurance in unhealthful
regions or on vicious or sub-standard lives.
Second To the investment
of its funds :
Send for "A Banker's Will," which
tells how the greatest accumulation of
trust funds in the world is invested.
Good health and good in
vestments will go a long way
toward making anyone rich.

; a week or more all over the country

is. it is to be regretted that there is any ; for a sensible celebration of the Fourth

ship between the two countries, but
there is not the remotest danger of war
between Russia and the United States,
notwithstanding the sensational head
lines that we shall see in the yellow
dailies for the next few days. But it
should not be forgotten that the bonds
of Russo-American friendship about
which orators have talked so much
have but little substance in them, after
all.

There is, in reality, nothing in com
mon between the United States and
Russia. There is a tradition that Rus
sia did us a substantial service at one
period in our civil war, when the czar
sent a squadron of warships to New
York. It was generally believed that
the English government was disposed
to pick a quarrel with us and take the
side of the confederacy, and that the
threatened war was averted by infor
mation reaching London that the Rus
sian admiral had secret orders to hoist
his flag on the side of the United States.

This general slaughter has not known
relation to the declaration. It is inane
and dangerous in the highest degree.
We have observed this with the hope
less interest with which people study the unattainable. It is all right to talk about, and it would be better yet to have, but it is impossible. Few individuals know how to improve a holiday and no nations do. We are perhaps the least successful in this matter, and the Fourth is the most abused.

It makes one shudder to think of the
bright eyes of today that will be blown
out day after tomorrow, of the unof
fending wayfarers who will be shot
down in cold blood by the didn't-know-
it-was-loaded fool, of the property that
will be destroyed by fires set by the
thoughtlessness of celebrators, and of
the grief and sorrow that will surely

Here does not seem to be any way
to stop the folly. It will go on from
bad to worse until on the good day
itself bedlam will break loose and de
partments and hospitals will be busy

main in diplomatic pigeon-holes. The
main points in the legend are probably
true, however. No doubt England was
led to pursue a circumspect course by
the knowledge that should she begin
a war against the United States the
opportunity would be improved by Rus
sia to fall upon the British in the rear.
There is probably good foundation for
the popular belief that it was out of
gratitude for Russia's friendly demon
stration in our waters at a critical time
that Secretary Seward agreed to the

The people of Arizona cannot
afford to have the territorial university con-

not to be impossible to find men who

proper conception of their duties and
the dignity of their positions.

Charles S. Fairchild, formerly of
Cleveland's cabinet, was interviewed at
New Orleans on the political situation
Tuesday, and he frankly declared that
he expected to see Roosevelt nominated
by the republicans and elected by the
people. "I do not believe," he says,
"that there is the least doubt about
Mr. Roosevelt's election."
