FILIPINO INDEPENDENCE

NOT IN EARLY PROSPECT

Mr. Taft Would Not Say It Would

Never Come.

Washington, D.C., Jan. 7. President
Taft generalized about the country's attitude toward Philippine in
dependence in an informal speech tonight at the annual dinner of the mil
itary organization of the Order of
Caribou. Incidentally he was installed as a member of the order. The
burden of the president's remarks was
to the effect that while unwilling to
say that the Philippines would never
be independent, "in my judgment, we
are likely to retain them a considerable time."
He went on to say in substance that
he would be prepared to see the islands
given up when it was honorable to
part with them but that would only
be when the people there were in a
position to establish a government
characterized by "due process of law and
entitled to the respect of all the nations of the
world."

AN OILMEN'S FEUD
ONE IS A CORPSE

The End Yesterday of a Feud at
Caney, Kan.

Caney, Kan., Jan. 7. A. O. Truskett,
who shot and killed J. D. S.
Neely, a prominent oil man at the
Palace hotel here this morning, was
arraigned before Justice of the Peace
William Lynn, on a charge of murder
in the first degree. He was released on a $25,000 bond. The preliminary hearing will be held next
Monday. Both Truskett and Neely
were wealthy, the latter being president of the Lima Trust company, the
Wichita Pipe Line company, and several other oil concerns. There was
enmity between them because of the
lease of valuable oil lands near Caney
that both claimed.
Truskett met Neely in the lobby
and the two went to an isolated
room. A moment later two shots
were heard. Neely was dead when
he was picked up. Truskett at once
surrendered.
In a statement to officers Truskett
said he fired in self-defense. The
coroner's inquest, late today, developed that Neely was not armed. The
jury found that he had "come to
his death from a gunshot wound in
the hands of A. O. Truskett."

POOR MEN'S HOTELS IN JAPAN.

In the Japanese capital there are
538 poor men's hotels. The northeast
of the capital is where the greatest
number is to be found. In these inns
the traveler is lodged in a room
with a superficial area of three feet
by six. If the traveler is better off
and requires more cubic feet of inn
he can obtain an apartment of the
same length but double the width.
And if he be more fastidious he can
have the luxury of an apartment six
feet by nine. The lowest cost of a
night's lodging is 5 sen.
In some parts of Japan the lodg
ings at poor men's inns can be ob
tained for 5 sen (about a penny).
There is a reduction on the 5 sen inn
if the room or cubicle be engaged for
two nights. This class of room is
furnished with a wool coverlet; for
10 sen a second coverlet is to be had.
Including the room with an area of
30 feet, and if the best class of sleeping apartment is obtained the cost is
25 sen, or about 2½ cents. It seems that
three travelers, if they wish to keep
to themselves, can hire this latter
class of apartment. The patrons of
these inns are for the most part laborers.

Los Angeles, Cal., Jan. 7. Didier
Masson, after unusual aviation trials,
reached San Bernardino on his Times
newspaper flight. During an exhibition in the afternoon something went
wrong with the mechanism and the
bi-plane crashed to the ground and
was badly damaged. Masson was unhurt.
Masson, after flying over Los Angeles, intending to go to Pomona next
got lost north of that city and dodged
among cliffs and canyons. His fuel
supply gave out and he came down
so hard he broke an oil pipe. After it
was repaired he flew to San Bernardino, where he delivered the papers,
five hours and forty minutes after
leaving Los Angeles.
He intended to return to Pomona
for exhibition flights, but the damage
was so bad it could not be repaired
in time.

IOWA STANDPATTERS
BREAK UP CAUCUS

Can be No Nomination For U.S.
Senator.

Des Moines, Ia., Jan. 7. Thirteen
stand-pat senators walked out of the
republican caucus today when the
progressives proposed to choose a
committee with power to call a caucus to nominate a candidate for
United States senator. Sixteen progressives remained and chose the
committee.
Thirty-five stand-pat members of
the legislature have signed an agreement not to go into the caucus to
select a United States senator. This
makes a caucus impossible and the
candidates will go before the open
session a week from Tuesday.
Senator LaFollette Young is demanding a special preliminary election to choose a senator for the un
expired term of Senator Dolliver.

"GLOVE-FITTING"
CORSETS

Thomson's
GLOVE-FITTING
Corsets
Is a corset name that means something
It is the only corset name that is ex
pressive of the comfort of the garment.
It means something, because every section and every gore of every corset
made by this famous factory for more
than a half century has been carefully
designed and more carefully put together to fit the figure like a glove.
Will be pleased to show you the merits of this corset. Our corsetiere will
fit you to perfection in one of these
models and alter them free, if necessary.
We have an up-to-date fitting room, a
few steps from our Corset Department.

A Decision by a Federal Judge at
Seattle.

Seattle, Wash., Jan. 7. Federal
Judge Cornelius H. Hanford, who
yesterday issued an injunction restraining the city from spending
money for the purpose of holding a
recall election for mayor, today declined to grant the order restraining
the city calling an election. Han
ford said he would only prevent the
payment of money out of the city
treasury and pending a final hearing
of the case would not interfere with
the city council's issuing an official
call for election.

In case the United States
court upholds Judge Hanford's de
cision restraining the city from appropriating public money for the
election, it is probable that the supporters of Mayor Hiram C. Gill will
raise funds by private subscription to
defray the cost of election should
such a proceeding be held legal.

ATHLETICS FOR BUSY MEN
ro-mv Kansas City. An Athletic Dir. ctor of the Chicago Athletic Associa
tion, is preparing an active and in
teresting winter season for the busy
men who feel too dignified or have
not the time to compete in open
athletics. In addition to the new
Indoor golf game, which Delaney is
having installed, he has created a new
game he will call "horse tennis."
The new game is a combination
of medicine ball and tennis, relieving
the monotony of routine medicine ball
work by adding the spice of competition. He plans to put the "students" into the game as soon as he
can outline a court on the gymnasium
floor, and a few have already
played at it without any court.
Instead of a tennis ball a three-
pound medicine ball is used in "horse
tennis" and the player is allowed to
pick up the ball and throw it at will,
rackets being out of the question because of the weight and size of the
ball. Instead of a net, an ordinary
sawhorse is used and the ball is
thrown over it. A regular tennis
court, diminished in size, will mark
the limits of play, and there will
be regular service courts with rules governing the service and volleying,
the same as in tennis. Delaney expects to have the courts laid out within a few days and ready for use.
The sole idea of the game is to
make the daily routine more interesting. The medicine ball will not
be eliminated by any means, as the
"horse tennis" is a trifle too violent
to be worked into all cases, especially
at the start. In the way of exercise
the new game makes a good midway
station for medicine ball and hand
ball. New York Evening Post

MUNICIPAL ICE RINK.
Though Dubuque is on the Mississippi
river and has one of the finest har
bors between New Orleans and St.
Paul there has been little or no ice
skating in recent years. Several times
attempts to conduct a private rink
have failed, principally owing to high
prices of admission

Alderman John O'Rourke plans to
utilize the whole of the harbor, which
is 1,400 feet long and 500 feet wide. The
harbor is now frozen over and as soon
as it is deemed advisable this surface
will be flooded from the city's water
system, thus giving it a surface as
smooth as glass.
Along the shores it is proposed to
build shelters where skates may be adjusted, where skaters may rest and
get warm and where they may have
their wraps checked. Policemen will
be present at all times, and representatives of the women's clubs of the city
will be assigned to regular duty as
chaperons. St. Louis Globe-Democrat
