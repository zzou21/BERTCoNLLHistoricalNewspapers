LET THE WIND
WATER FAR

Get a SAMSON Windmill and have pure, fresh water for your
stock all the time. Run pipes to the house and have fresh
running water in the house for the bath, toilet and kitchen.
A SAMSON will develop the most power in the lightest winds
and when properly set up is almost immune from trouble.
The Samson is double geared which does away with all side
strain something other types of mills can't do. The Samson
has to be oiled only once in two or three months and is fitted
with a governor which is positive and governs just as accurately as a steam engine. Adjust this governor to your prevailing wind and no matter how much faster the wind may
blow, though it increases to a gale, the Samson will continue
pumping without 5 per cent variation.
There are many other reasons why the Samson is best but
which can't be even briefly mentioned here. Come in and see
the machine, examine it, then compare with other mills on
the market.
