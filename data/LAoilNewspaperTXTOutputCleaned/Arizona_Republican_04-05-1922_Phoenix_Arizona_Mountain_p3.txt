Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market

[Republican A.P. Leased Wire]
NEW YORK, April 4 Business on
the stock exchange today was on the
largest, if not the most comprehensive,
scale of any session since December 20, 1920, total sales amount
ing to 1,375,000 shares.
The greater part of this activity
was at the expense of quoted values,
however, a number of favorites in the
industrial and miscellaneous groups
reacting 1 to 3 points, while a few
specialties displayed greater heaviness. In earlier movement, when the
price tendencies among leaders were
again upward, between 30 and 40 issues, including United States Steel,
Studebaker and some of the oils were
at new high records for a year or
more.
Much of the forenoon's demand was
ascribed to pools, but the continued
activity of commission or “wire” houses gave color to the belief that
public participation was taking on
greater proportions.
One of the diverting features of the
day was the reaction of 6½ points at
mid-day by Studebaker, the recent
outstanding issue. Studebaker made
partial recovery, closing at a net loss
of 2¼ points.
A majority of the steels, equip
ments, rubbers and oils finished at
losses of fractions to 1½ points, but
Shippings, sugar and chemicals, notable Davison, were firm to strong.
Rails were apathetic throughout,
many of the investment division hold
ing within fractional bounds.
Neither money nor foreign ex
change figured to any extent in the
day’s operations. Call loans opened
and held at 4Vi per cent until the
final half-hour, when a rate of 6 per
cent was posted. Time money remained at 4Vi to 4¾ per cent, ac
cording to the length of maturity, but
offerings were light.
Dealings in international remit
tances expanded from yesterday’s
nominal operations and firmness was
shown by practically all bills excepting German and Spanish rates. Sterling rose to within a fraction of $4.40;
allied quotations were slightly higher,
and Dutch and Scandinavian bills
added to yesterday's gains.

STATE MINING NEWS
By Chas. F. Willis, Editor Arizona Mining Journal

Copper Situation: Numerous in
quiries are reported in the copper
market during the past week in spite
of a slight falling off in sales of the
metal. One authority states that
purchases of copper during the first
two weeks of March were approximately 100,000,000 pounds at an av
erage price of 13 cents for March and
April delivery. It is confidently felt
that this month will see a gradually
increasing price for copper as a re
sult of a growing demand.
Miami: Increasing activity in the
copper mining industry in this dis
trict is seen in the production of the
International Smelting company
which is now approximating 21,300,000 pounds a month. This figure is
very close to the capacity production
of the International smelter.
Pearce: A considerable revival is
evidenced in this district from which
the Commonwealth Development
company and a number of leasors
are shipping six or more cars of ore
and tailings to the Calumet & Arizona smelter at Douglas. Leasors
are also active on the Commonwealth
Extension.
Jerome: The property of the Shea
Copper company was recently exam
ined by officials of the Calumet &
Arizona Mining company with a pos
sibility of determining the future
development of the property. The
mine was recently unwatered by the
Shea management. Oscar Engelder
is manager.

and preparing to sink to the 500
level. The company is also prepar
ing to construct a concentrating
plant and is planning regular ship
ments to the Humboldt smelter when
the latter is blown in.
Douglas: Production of copper at
the smelter of the Calumet & Arizona
company has been in the neighbor
hood of 2,462,000 pounds, the com

district. Production at the New
Cornelia was about 1,459,000 pounds.
Miami: development work at the
properties of The Louis d’Or Mining
and Milling company continues to
show promising results, recent assays
of ore showing from 15 to 30 per
cent copper, with the general run of
ore well over 3 per cent. The per
manent shaft is proving the correctness of diamond drill work.
Morenci: The remodeling plans of
the No. 6 concentrator of the Phelps

ores to the C. & A. smelter at Douglas
have been resumed by the 85 mine,

mine was purchased by the C. & A.
about two years ago.
Swansea: Operations have been re
sumed at the mines of the Swansea
lease after a shut down of more than
a year. A force of about 40 men
is being employed for the present,
a number of these being engaged in
improving the road between Swansea
and the Planet mine.
Ray: Instructions for the resump
tion of operations on April 1 have
been received by the management of
the Ray consolidated Copper company. The Ray reopens in conjunc
tion with other Jackling properties,
including Chino, Utah and Nevada
Consolidated. The Ray Cons. mill
at Hayden, together with the A. S.
& R. smelter at the same place, will
also operate.
