MOTION IN ARREST ,
DENIED BY JUDGE KENT

IN THE CASE -OF FRANK SHIN
DELBOWER. A Motion - For a New Trial Will be

A motion in arrest of judgment in
the case of Frank Shindelbower,
awaiting sentence for perjury was de
nied by Judge Kent yesterday after
noon and the hearing of a motion for
a new trial was set for tomorrow. If
a new trial should not be granted sen
tence will be passed upon the youth
on Friday.
The denial of the motion in arrest
followed an argument of an hour and
a half by H. H. Howard for the de
fense and District Attorney Bullard
for the territory. The defense attack
ed the indictment on the ground that
it did not set forth that the testimony
which had been given by Shindelbower
against the Casino saloon and which
at his trial was declared by the jury
to be false, was material. The alleged
false testimony, it was the contention
of the defense, must appear in the
indictment in substance. Its materiality
cannot be set forth by mere averment.
The testimony of Shindelbower, so
far as could be gathered from the in
dictment, said his attorney, did not ap
pear to be damaging to the defense
in the saloon case. It only set out that
he had bought a pint of whiskey at
the Casino saloon and it did not ap
pear from the indictment that the sal
oon did not have the right to sell
him whiskey. It did not appear that
he was a minor.
Moreover, while the indictment al
luded to the saloon case by its title in
which the Phoenix Amusement com
pany was the defendant, no mention
is thereafter made of the amusement
company but reference was made
to the testimony of the defendant in
this case against the Casino.
A stranger to the facts in the saloon
case, said the attorney, could gather
nothing from the indictment.
Alluding to a statement made by
the district attorney the day before
that a California decision had held
that in a perjury case an averment
of the materiality of the alleged per
jured testimony was sufficient, and
that as the Arizona statute had been
taken from the California statute, the
construction of the California courts
should be adopted, Mr. Howard said
that there had been no copying of the
California statute and therefore there
should be no adoption of an erroneous
opinion.
The statute in question, said Mr.
Howard, had been a federal statute
for 120 years. It had been adopted by
several states before the existence of
the state of California and by many
other states since, and before it be
came a part of the laws of this terri
tory. The preponderance of decisions,
he said, had been against the Califor
nia view and even the United States
supreme court had held contrary to
that view. In this Mr. Howard allud
ed to the well known pension case.
Mr. Bullard declared on the other
hand that the California statute was
not identical with the federal statute
or with the statutes of many other
states and he further disputed Mr.
Howard's construction of the opinion
in the pension case as well as in other
cases which had been cited by him.
This view was sustained by Judge
Kent.
The motion for a new trial has not
yet been prepared but it is understood
that it will be based on the discovery
of new and material evidence.

COMMITTED BURGLARY
SACRILEGE AT JEROME
Two Convicts Enroute From Prescott to Florence.

Deputy Sheriff George Helsler
arrived from Prescott yester
day with three convicts for
Florence. Two of them were Americans who say their names are J. R.
Livingstone and P. Phillips. They
were convicted of burglarizing the
Catholic church at Jerome. They had
not much of a defense to offer since
they were caught while leaving the
edifice, laden with gold and silver
plate. They were each sentenced to
four years in the territorial prison.
Livingstone was recognized as a fre
quent inmate of the jail of this coun
ty, though under a different name.
The third was a Mexican convicted
of horse stealing, a charge which he
still indignantly denies and proclaims
that he is a victim of circumstance
and a misapprehension of the true
facts.
He is enough of a lawyer to under
stand that intent is a necessary ele
ment of crime and he swears that he
had no intention of stealing the horse
when he took it. He merely wanted
to go to Humboldt and did not want to
walk. He accordingly rode the horse
to the smelter town and on arriving
there he had no further use for the
animal. It would have been heartless
to turn it adrift. It was up to him
to provide the animal a protector. He
knew enough of human nature to
know if one acquired the horse for
nothing he would not take the same
care of it that he would if it represented
something of value. Therefore
he placed a price on the animal, not a
price so high as to be prohibitive but
just enough to interest the purchaser
in his newly acquired property.

Terrible Croup
One Who Knows Recommends a Rem
edy to Anxious Mothers.

My little boy, who is four years old,
has suffered a lot with croup. On
several occasions we thought he was
gone.
After trying all the old time reme
dies and most of the new, I came
home one night at midnight, and my
wife said, "The boy has the croup
again suppose you get a bottle of
Hyomci." "More junk." I said, "but
we will circulate our money so they
all will get some."
I hastened to an all night drug
store, brought it home. In five minutes
he was breathing easier. In fifteen
minutes he was sound asleep. It
broke the croup so quickly it scared
me.
Anyone wishing to cure the croup
of a child I hope will give Hyomci a
trial.
Wishing you the best of success,
which you surely deserve, I remain,
Jos. R. Clark, 204 Fifth St., S. E., Washington.
Oct. 7.
Hyomci is a remarkably effective
remedy in case of croup and it should
be in every home where there is a
croupy child. Full instructions how to
cure croup comes with each outfit.
Complete Hyomci outfit including
inhaler costs $1.50 at druggists every
where and at Ivett Drug Co. It is
guaranteed to cure catarrh, coughs,
colds and sore throat.
If relief is not at once obtained, con
sult Dr. Emmon's special office, North Fourth avenue.

LOCKS DOOR AND THEN
WIELDS HORSEWHIP
W. H. Donahue Faces Assault Charge
Before Judge Thomas.

Charging that W. H. Donahue had
accompanied him into the office of the
O. K. stables and after locking the
door had administered to him such a
beating with a horsewhip that great
welts were raised across his back,
John K. Lamont appeared as the
plaintiff in an assault case before
Judge Thomas yesterday afternoon.
That, nothing as physically able to
do all that Lamont charged was quite
apparent, the former being a stalwart,
bony specimen of manhood, while the
latter plainly showed that he was nei
ther blest with the best of health nor
endowed with a physique calculated
to give him the best end in a fistic en
counter.
"I had gone into the office," said
Lamont, "and Donahue followed. He
no sooner entered the room than he
locked the door behind us and then
started to talk to me about some notes.
Before I had had time to say three
words, Donahue grabbed a buggy whip
and struck me repeatedly across the
face and shoulders. He only stopped
when a crowd gathered outside and
threatened to break down the door un
less he opened up and let me atone.
"In the course of his attack upon
me he not only inflicted those welts
but he tore the links out of my shirt
cuffs, threw my tobacco box into a
corner of the room and would have
probably inflicted more serious injury
but for the timely arrival of my friends.
It would be absurd for a man of the size
of Donahue to claim that I struck
him or that he acted in self-defense."
Donahue explained the affair from
his viewpoint by stating that Lamont
had first attacked him with the whip
and that any injuries inflicted came in
the course of his efforts to take the
whip from Lamont. At the same time
he evinced a
willingness to the charge if he was pre
pared to pay a small fine.
Judge Thomas asked him if he was
willing to be sworn and he was put
under oath.
Lamont's own appearance indicated
that he had been roughly handled and
Judge Thomas accordingly fined Don
ahue ten dollars, which Donahue said
he was sure he could raise.
