THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, TUESDAY MORNING, JULY 3, 1900.

ESSE

MONEY, BRAIN AND OIL
FORTUNE MAKING MUST BEGUN
In spite of the fact that millions of dollars have already been made in buying California oil stocks the wealth
making era has just begun.
There are no longer any experiments. There are no
guesses. There are no disappointments.
The vast Sunset District has been tried and proved.
The deep central deposits of oil have been located. And
the Sunset Czar property was secured because it was the
richest and most favorably situated land in the whole region.
Every dollar invested in this company goes right to
work in accomplishing something. It is just as secure as
though invested in the bank; it has the earning force of ten
dollars in any other enterprise.

A GOLF EVENT.
New York, July 2. The biggest event
in the golfing world of this year began
today on the links at Garden City and
will continue through the week. The
occasion is the annual tournament for
the amateur golf championship of the
United States. The tournament is held
under the auspices of the United States
Golf association, the only definite or
ganization of golf clubs in the world.
All the leading golf clubs in this coun
try are included in its membership and
a majority of these are represented in
the tournament which opened today.
Judging from the auspicious manner in
which the play began and the prompti

championship contest will go on record
as one of the most perfectly arranged
affairs of its kind that has ever taken
place in the history of the game in this
country.

Consider the Vital Points
Ask yourself what makes the "Czar" superior to the
ordinary oil company.
First: the land. Great enough in extent to support
many companies in a most prosperous condition. Located
where it drains the great oil strata of the Sunset District.
Second, in addition to the surety of striking bountiful
flows of oil, there is the likelihood of striking such wells as
have made fortunes for every investor in almost a day.
The Sunset Czar is in a land of gushers, (the most recent
gusher was well 17 of Jewett & Blodgett, which broke
the former great record. This well immediately adjoins
the Czar.)
Third, the backing of wealthy men, whose experience
and money will carry it to the greatest success.
