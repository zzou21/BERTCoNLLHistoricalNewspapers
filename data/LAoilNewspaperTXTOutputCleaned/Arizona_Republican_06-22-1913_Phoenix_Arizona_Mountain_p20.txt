Mine Promoter Killed

New York, Jan. 13. John T. Bade, an
inventor and prospector, was killed
today when a gun he was loading accidentally discharged.
Bade had been in prospecting in Arizona and California, and
had been in New York several months. He was preparing a new
scheme in which he expected to interest many local investors.
He leaves a widow and three children.

Platinum Substitute
A dispatch from Albany says:
"Professor Jordan has announced the
discovery of a new alloy equal to
platinum which would reduce
the demand for platinum. The discovery was important, the
professor said, because platinum is not available in sufficient
quantities."

If the above substitute has any
commercial value it will lessen the
demand for raw metals. It is
wise to take these stories with caution
and await further developments.
Mining production for May amounted
to 2,000,000 pounds of copper. It is
expected that similar tonnage will be
mined at the mills this month. If
this tonnage is attained it will mean
a full production of approximately
3,000,000 pounds of copper.
