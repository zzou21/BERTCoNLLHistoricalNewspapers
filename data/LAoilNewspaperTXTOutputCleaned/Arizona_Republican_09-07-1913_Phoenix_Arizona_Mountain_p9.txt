Mealey swamped
conversation that
his inexperience
gang the biggest
dinner ever held in

Market Master Mealey appeared in
the city treasurer's office yesterday
with a pump gun of the latest make
and after making sure that every
body in the office had taken a good
squint at him, gravely announced
that he intended getting up bright
and early this morning for the pur
pose of slaughtering a few wild
ducks.
Right there City Treasurer Bar
nett became interested and started a
talk with the crowd all about the
right thing to do when hunting.
Presently Mealey became interested
and soon the talk took on the aspect
of a hunt club with Barnett's stories
well in the lead.

So interested in the
he forgot all about
and promised the
and best duck din
Phoenix. To make

sure that he will be able to carry out

his promises he has got himself a
gun with a barrel over two yards
long so that if he misses the ducks
with the shot he will be able to re
verse the gun and use it as a club.
The gun has the calibre of a cannon
of the coast defense variety and any
thing that gets within a mile on
each side of the muzzle can say good
bye to its friends and resign itself
to the cooking pot.
Mealey's intimate friends however,
upon hearing of the proposed excur
sion into the wilds of the Salt River
valley, stated that Mealey would be
extremely lucky if he came back with
two mudhens and if anyone was fool
enough to starve themselves in an
ticipation of the duck dinner they
would be fit persons to send out to
Dr. Kingsley's sanitarium on the
Tempe road.

Beside the big cannon mentioned
above, Mealey has laid in a large
stock of dynamite cartridges and a
large bottle of chloroform so that if
the gun goes back on him he will be
able to put the game under the in
fluence of the anesthetic and thus
bring it home.

HANDSOME HOME

Fine Salesroom and Service
Station to Be on Recently
Purchased Valuable Tract
at Center and Pierce
Streets

The most important city real estate
deal of the week was the purchase by

the Cadillac Motor Car Company of V.
M. Mognett of the tract on the south
east corner of Center Street and Pierce
for a consideration in the neighbor
hood of $12,000. The purchasers de
sign it for a location for a garage, ex
clusive salesroom and service station.
This tract has a frontage of ninety
feet on Center Street. It lies just be
yond the Adams Annex Hotel and has
been occupied for the last sixteen years
by Dave Goldberg for whose use the
house now on it was built by Mr. Mog
nett. Work on the garage will be begun
on September 10 by the excavation for
the basement which will be under a
considerable part of the building. The
garage will have a frontage of ninety
feet on Center and a depth of 110 feet.
It will be brick, covered with cement.
The design will be thoroughly mission
with three bell towers, the large one
in the middle front and smaller ones at
each end of the front. On each tower
there will be a flag pole for the dis
play of Cadillac banners. The ground
and the building will represent an in
vestment of about $25,000.
This salesroom and service station
designed for the use exclusively of
Cadillac cars will be one of the hand
somest in the country.
One side of the front used for the
sales room of dimension of 35 by 50
feet will include a rest and reading
room as well as a washroom for ladies.
On the other side there will be hand
somely appointed offices. The floors of
this part of the building will be hard
maple.
Back of this space will be the gar
age which will be entered from the

Pierce Street side by two doors. Here
every equipment for the handling and
care of automobiles will be installed.
In the extreme rear will be a shower
bath for the accommodation of the em
ployes. The Cadillac Motor Car Company
consists of E. R. Pirtle of Douglas and
W. A. Horrell, the manager of this
branch. It is intended by the company
to establish other salesrooms and ser
vice stations throughout the Cadillac
territory covered by it including all of
Arizona and six of the western coun
ties of Texas. Mr. Pirtle, the founder
of Pirtleville, near Douglas and who
has been connected with the Cadillac

agency for several years is a man of
considerable wealth and it is expected
will make other investments here.
This service station and garage will
be ready for occupancy about Novem
ber 1.

FINANCES AND
MARKETS

[ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH]
NEW YORK, Sept. 6. Speculative
conditions today did not favor active
movements in stocks and the mar
ket was dull. The holiday on the
London exchange deprived this mar
ket of a stimulus from that source.
Uncertainty regarding the weekly
bank statement and the forthcoming
crop report also tended to keep down
speculative commitments to a mini
mum. The undertone was distinctly
strong. The most important move
ment of today was a slump of near
ly two points in New Haven.
The withdrawal of J. P. Morgan
and Company as fiscal agents for the
road led to active trading in that
stock at the opening and it quickly
declined to 90½ a point above the
low record. At that figure it met
support and mounted steadily until
it scored a full recovery. In the list
of specialties Pullman, People's Gas
and California Petroleum made ma
terial gains. The showing of the
banks was better than was expected.
Bonds steady, total sales, par value

pons advanced.

MISCONCEPTION ABOUT
BAILEE'S MAIL MATTER

Letter Belongs to Sender, Not Sendee,
Until Actually Delivered; McClin
tock Points Out the Rule

"What is your mail?"
That was the puzzled question ad
dressed to Postmaster McClintock yes
terday by one of his clients. And
once launched upon the subject, the
colonel made explanation, which was
about like this:
"Your" mail is the mail you send.
When one speaks about going down
to the postoffice for my mail, he is
technically wrong, for he has no mail
until it is correctly placed in his
hand. The sender is boss of the let
ter until it is correctly delivered. The
receiver has nothing to say about the
disposition of letters or other mail
matter addressed to him.
The cause of this discussion was
an incident in a story in a recent
issue of a magazine. The story tells
of a sympathetic young man who
blows up a safe in order to recover
a registered letter for a young wom
an who has changed her mind about
sending it. The story was a bully
one, but it was founded on a mis
understanding of the powers of the
sender of a letter. As a matter of
fact, if the girl had gone to the
postoffice the next day, or had sent
to the receiving postoffice, she could
have recovered her letter without
trouble or question. But for the pur
poses of fiction, one of the peculiarly
unknown postal laws was ignored en
tirely.
"So," concluded Colonel McClintock,
"if you have any letters in transit,
they are the ones you yourself have
sent, and not those you go down to
the postoffice every morning to get."
