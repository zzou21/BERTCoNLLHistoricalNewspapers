NEWS IN CHIHUAHUA

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
DOUGLAS, Ariz., March 29. Not two
hundred Carranza troops remained in
the Casas Grandes and Galeana dis
tricts of Chihuahua according to the
statement of United States Senator
A. B. Fall of New Mexico, who said
he had been so informed on good au
thority. Senator Fall arrived here tonight
from Hachita, N. M., in the course of
an automobile tour of the border.
"All the Carranza soldiers might as
well be withdrawn for all the good
they are doing in aiding our men. They
made no attempt to stop Villa when he
passed Casas Grandes in broad day
light, less than a mile from the garri
son," said Senator Fall. "He had no
more than three hundred men with him
at that time. I have it from good au
thority that he did not have a great
many more than that number when he
attacked Columbus."
Commenting upon the question of
supplying the punitive expedition Senator Fall said:
"The United States should have the
use of the Mexico Northwestern rail
road from the Carranza government
without any reservations."
Senator Fall arraigned the administra
tion for its handling of the Mexican
question, saying President Wilson
would accept no advice from persons
familiar with Mexico, who understood
the situation.
He and his party will leave tomorrow
for an inspection of other points along
the border to the west of Douglas.

Peons on Warpath.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 29. Mexi
can peons thronged the streets of Maz
atlan, tore up American flags and
threatened to do bodily harm to Amer
ican residents there when they learned
of the punitive expedition sent after
Francisco Villa, according to Captain
Frank Paschal of the schooner Panama,
which arrived from the Mazatlan port today.
Mexicans of the better class as well
as officials of the port co-operated in
stopping the rioting, Captain Paschal
said. He said there is no apparent
anti-American feeling among the more
educated natives but that the peons are
easily inflamed.
Because of uneasiness among resi
dents along the Mexican border in this
county, city officials today sent a
request to the war department at
Washington, urging that troops be sta
tioned at several towns near the line.
It was declared there was no fear of
an invasion but that depredations by
irresponsibles was not improbable.

BODY OF PECK

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, March 29. District
Attorney Edward Swann centered his
efforts tonight upon locating Eugene
Oliver Kane, who embalmed the body
of John E. Peck, wealthy Grand
Rapids druggist for whose murder his
son-in-law, Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
is under arrest here. Kane's arrest has
been ordered on the charge of
conspiracy to commit a crime.

Waite is said by Mr. Swann to have
asserted that Kane accepted $9,000 in
cash and a check for $9,400 as part
payment of $25,000 he was to be paid
for swearing that he used arsenic in
embalming Peck's body. This ar
rangement, Waite said, according to
the district attorney, was made after
an autopsy on Peck's body disclosed
the presence of a large quantity of
arsenic. Waite, in a statement made
to the district attorney and others, is
said to have confessed not only to
poisoning Peck, but placing germs of
virulent diseases in the food of Mrs.
Peck, who died at Waite's apartment
six weeks before her husband.

John S. Potter, the undertaker who
had charge of Peck's funeral and who
employed Kane as embalmer, was ex
amined this afternoon and tonight at
the district attorney's office. Potter
reiterated denials that he had any
part in the alleged negotiations be
tween Kane and Waite except to send
Kane to the dentist's apartment when
Waite desired to know the formula of
the embalming fluid used on Peck's
body. He said, however, that he re
ceived a letter from Waite asking him
and Kane not to telephone him, as
Waite believed his telephone wire had
been tapped and also telling him he
need not worry about his check.

Kane embalmed the body of Mrs.
Katherine Adams, in the famous
Molineux case, and Potter was the
undertaker who attended to the body
of William M. Rice, for whose death
Albert T. Patrick was tried.

Ineffectual efforts were made by
Mrs. Margaret Weaver Horton, Waite's
friend, who has been closely questioned
by the district attorney, to obtain per
mission to visit Waite at Bellevue hos
pital. Her attorney, Harold Spielberg,
intimated that if neither he nor Mrs.
Horton is allowed to see Waite to
morrow he will take some action. Mrs.
Horton, in a letter to Waite today,
expressed her sympathy and confidence
in his innocence.

Emphatic denials of reports that
financial or other assistance has been
or will be given by them to Dr. Waite
was contained in a statement issued by
the members of the Peck family. The
statement also was said to represent
the opinions and feelings of Mrs. Clara
Louise Waite, the young dentist's wife.

OIL LAND HEARING

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LOS ANGELES, March 29. Hear
ings in the government suit to recover
Kern county oil lands from the South
ern Pacific company, which were al
leged to have been obtained by fraud,
were concluded here today. They will
be resumed April 10 in Washington,
D. C.

of the U. S. district court, and court
attaches will leave for Washington next Sunday.
District Attorney Schoonover claim
ed today that the government won an
important point in the litigation when the
court granted permission for an agent
of the government to remain on the land
involved in the suit to observe opera
tions, although the motion to restrain the
Southern Pacific from continuing drilling
was denied yesterday.

TRIES TO SETTLE

CARMEN'S TIEUP

Republican A. P. Leased Wire

TOLEDO, Ohio, March 29. Henry L.
Doherty of New York, head of the Doherty
interests which control the Toledo street
car system, is on his way from New York
in an effort to put an end to the tieup
which has caused an uprising among
citizens who sympathize with the car
men's union.
The car men were locked out yester
day after the refusal of the Toledo
Railways and Light Company to recog
nize the organization effected two weeks ago.
All cars were sent into the barns and the
public has had to depend on motor buses
and other inefficient methods of conveyance.
No demands have been made by the
men other than recognition of the union
and permission to wear buttons furnished
by organized labor. A general strike of
electric men is planned if the company
makes any attempt to start its cars with
non-union workers.

BRIDGE

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29. The
construction of a $20,000,000 bridge
across San Francisco bay, connecting
San Francisco and Alameda counties,
is a possibility of the future, according
to an announcement made today in
which it was stated that the plans for
the bridge had been made and that
the chambers of commerce of San
Francisco, Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley were interested in the pro
ject.
The plans, proposed by Harlan D.
Miller, a New York engineer, were
submitted today at a meeting of repre
sentatives of the four chambers of
commerce and received the endorse
ment as to their practicability, it was
announced, of Colonel Thomas H. Rees,
U. S. A., of the United States board of
harbor engineers.
The proposed bridge would be four
miles long and of an average height
of 30 feet above the water. The great
est altitude of the bridge would be 125
feet at one place to permit the passage
of lofty sparred sailing vessels. The
plans provide for four railroad tracks
and two roadways, one for automobiles
and the other for slower moving ve
hicular traffic.

VILLA YAQUI INDIAN

Who is Francisco Villa? Who is the
man who, with a handful of adherents,
is now defying two nations to bring
about his capture?
In view of the fact that the whole
western hemisphere has its eyes on
Villa as the individual who has kicked
up one large cloud of trouble, the
statement issued here recently by
David Villa says to who Francisco Villa
really is comes with unusual interest
at this time.
Francisco Villa is not Francisco
Villa at all; he is not even a Mexican.
He is nothing more than a full-blooded
Yaqui Indian, says David Villa, who
resents the fact that the name of a
noble family should have been used by
a man who, he says, is no more en
titled to it than Sitting Bull or Fight
ing Bear would have been.
David Villa is the scion of a noble
Castilian family which for many years
previous to the revolution wielded a
powerful influence in Mexican affairs.
His father is a wealthy cattle baron
of Lower California and his uncle con
trols extensive land and mining inter
ests in that and other sections of
Mexico. He is here as the guest of
A. T. Solomon, social deputy sheriff
and court interpreter, who lives at
201 West Fifty-ninth place.
"The right name of the man who is
now fleeing General Pershing is Dor
oteo Hurango," said David Villa yes
terday. "He is a full-blooded Yaqui
and that is all. For sixteen years or
more he defied the Mexican govern
ment as a cattle rustler and bandit
and it was at this period of his career
that he assumed the name of Francisco
Villa. That name was selected at ran
dom for the ease with which the ini
tials could be used in forging brands
on cattle. For example, if the brand
was V, Hurango would combine an H
to form a new brand and an F would
similarly be changed into an F. V."
David Villa holds no fear that the
former chieftain of the revolu
tion will be able to gather any con
siderable number to his support.
"All of the better class Mexicans are
crying for peace," he said, "and most
of them seem to think that this can
best be brought about through the
policy which has been outlined by
Carranza and the administration at
Washington." Los Angeles Tribune.

AFFECTATION
The wild havoc affectation makes
in that part of the world which should
be most polite is visible wherever we
meet impertinences in conversation,
but also in their premeditated speech,
whose business it is to cut off all
superfluities in what is spoken before
it by the transitional unit; I have seen
it make a man run from the purpose
before a judge who was, when at the
bar himself, so close and logical a
pleader that, with all the pomp of
eloquence in his power, he never
spoke a word too much. Steele.
