FOREIGN NOTES

AND COMMENT

Mines and Mining

The presence in Tucson of a London
capitalist, one of the owners of the
Ray copper mine and others interested
in the property, causes no little
interest in the mines. The Ray Copper
Mines, Limited, is the name of the
company as organized in London,
England, to operate the Ray, Innes
and Taylor groups of copper mines on
Mineral creek, Pinal county. The com
pany was registered in London, June
5, by Thorne & Company of 17 Fenchurch street. The capital is 200,000
in ordinary shares of 1 each, of
which 145,000 shares have been issued.
The Silver Belt says that the proper
ty on Mineral creek comprises 52
claims, together with the old Ray
mill and some other machinery, and is
situated 45 miles from Picacho, the
nearest station on the Southern Pacific railroad. The report of Alexander Hill, the expert of the
Minerals Exploration Company, the
vendors of the property, is somewhat
optimistic as such reports are apt to
be, but there is no doubt of the great
value of the property. Mr. Hill states
that there are 190,000 tons of ore in
sight, the profit on which with copper at 50 per ton he estimates at
14 shillings per ton of crude ore, or
£133,000, whereas should the present
price of copper be maintained, say
75 per ton, the profits would be
much greater. The company will
operate the present mill and it is
probable that a plant of large capac
ity will be ordered. Tucson Star.
Messrs. Irish, Ellis and Baxter, who
recently sold the Twin Butte mine
are enjoying the proceeds of the sale
by visiting their old home. They have
already received $120,000 of the pur
chase price of $300,000. Michael Irish
has gone to Ireland to visit the scenes
of his boyhood days. John Ellis ac
companies him across the Atlantic to
visit his old home in Scotland. The
other partner, John G. Baxter, has
gone to his old home in Wisconsin.

Before the days of anaesthetics these experiments were all contrived under consciousness, and the
argument therefore is that running
through them all there was a vitalizing
condition which rendered them futile.
By this word "anaesthetics" just re
mind me of one of those futile grounds
of experimentation in which there is
not very much cruelty yet fully shows
how absolutely stupid and, from my
point of view, useless these experi
ments are. -London Letter to New

JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS

A Shy Man With a Great Deal of

Notoriety.

CURIOUS BURIAL WISH.
Lawson Tait Wanted to be Interred
in a "Cave."

Few writers, with the exception, per
haps, of Rudyard Kipling, carry their
dislike to notoriety to the extent that
"Uncle Remus" Joel Chandler Harris
does. An affable and most genial
man ordinarily, the fact that some ad
mirer of his work is desirous of seeing
him produces an attack of nervousness
causes him to play hide and seek, and
if this fails and he is confronted the
author is generally found to be a much
better listener than talker. His home
in Atlanta is on the outskirts of the
town, and although a daily contribu
tor to the Atlanta Constitution he
works entirely at home and sees very
little of society.

Although Atlanta is visited in the
course of the year by nearly all of the
theatrical companies he has never
been known to go to the theater to see
one, the only time that he will come
out of his shell being when James
Whitcomb Riley gives one of his read
ings. This happened about six years
ago, and then there was no more delighted
appreciator in the house than "Uncle
Remus." For the next five years,
however, he carefully avoided the thea
ter. When about a year ago the
Hoosier poet made another tour of the
South, Frank L. Stanton asked Mr.
Harris to accompany him that night
to the reading. When the poet called
early in the evening to make sure that
"Uncle Remus" would be ready on
time, the latter was already prepared
and was beginning to worry.

"Won't we be late?" he asked.
"Not for several hours yet," an
swered Stanton.

The next day the Georgia poet and
the Indiana poet went for a drive, and
in accordance with the former's plan
stopped at Mr. Harris' home. Mr.
Riley at first objected to our calling on
the ground that it was not fair to sur
prise a man in this way.

"If he knew you were coming," re
plied Stanton, "and had time to wait
for you, by this time he would have
had nervous prostration."

As it was "Uncle Remus" was caught
before he had worked up to the proper
nervous pitch, and, though he swung
his hat to and fro in a much-abashed
manner during the first few minutes of
the conversation, he and the man he
admired so much soon became fast
friends. Riley seldom visits the town
without Harris at Atlanta.

Mr. Harris is a most methodical
worker: he goes to the Constitution
office every morning at 8 o'clock for
his mail and papers and remains about
an hour, going home to work. In
addition to his newspaper labors he
is at present engaged on two books.
Saturday Evening Post.

The case of the soi-disant Princess
Wrede, who spent last winter in this
country, has been once more engaging
the attention of the French tribunals,
and the court of cassation, that is to
say, the supreme tribunal of France,
has just given a final decree in favor
of Prince Adolph Wrede, according to
which his marriage to the lady in ques
tion is invalid, and she has no right
whatsoever to bear either the title or
the name of a Princess Wrede. The
self-styled princess is by birth a Vien
nese girl, and of the name of Malda-
mer. She married early in the eight
ies a doctor of Austrian-Poland, named
Dobriansky. Both were Roman Cath
olics. They thereupon emigrated to
Russia, where the doctor took out let
ters of naturalization as a Russian
citizen, his change of nationality car
rying along with it that of his wife.
Subsequently they quarreled, and the
doctor obtained from the Russian ec
clesiastical court a divorce. On the
strength of this the lady, a couple of
years later, contracted at Paris a mar
riage with the Bavarian Prince Adolph
Wrede. He only lived with her a
short time, and then left her on dis
covering that the ecclesiastical court
at St. Petersburg had exceeded its pow
ers in granting a legal dissolution of a
marriage contracted by two Roman
Catholics in Austria before being nat
uralized as Russians. On this plea the
prince obtained from the courts of his
country, namely, Bavaria, a decree de
claring his marriage with Mme. Dob
riansky null and void, the Bavarian
courts taking the ground that at the
time of Prince Wrede's marriage to
the lady her union to the doctor had
not been legally dissolved, and, in fact,
that she remains in the eyes of the
law the wife of the physician until
this day.

The prince thereupon asked the
French courts to register this Bavarian
decree of dissolution, his application
to the French tribunals being due to
the fact that he had married the lady
in France. Mme. Dobriansky, exceed
ingly anxious to retain the title and
name of Princess Wrede, opposed the
demand, and the matter has been car
ried from one court to another, until
finally the supreme tribunal of France,
namely, the court of cassation, has
now rendered judgment to the effect
that "a decree of the Bavarian court
concerning two foreigners, one of them
a Bavarian having no legal domicile in
France, is effective and valid in France."
In this manner the ex-operatic singer
is deprived now and for all times of
her title and status of Wrede, and
becomes once more Mme. Dobriansky,
a woman separated from her first
husband, but not divorced.

Prince Adolph Wrede, as soon as the
Bavarian courts had decreed that his
marriage with Mme. Dobriansky was
null and void, contracted another
union at Geneva with an extremely
wealthy widow of the name of Benites
from Buenos Ayres, and at the time
the soi-disant Princess Adolph Wrede
was being entertained at Washington,
the authentic South American Princess
Adolph Wrede was entertaining the
diplomatic corps, royally, and the
cream of society at Madrid, where
Prince Adolph, who is a chamberlain
of the prince regent of Bavaria, now
spends the greater part of the year.

The countess of Russell seems at
length to have reached the same con
clusion as the theater-going public,
namely, that she is totally unfitted for
the stage, possessing neither voice nor
dramatic talent. At the beginning she
met with a moderate amount of suc
cess, being the first peeress of the
realm to come before the footlights in
a purely professional capacity. But of
late she has been so coldly received
that she decided to emulate "The Run
away Girl," by deserting her post in
that musical comedy. She has settled
at Bray for the summer months, and
will devote herself to the river and
other out-of-door amusements. She
has been a familiar figure on the
Thames all the way from Bray to Hen
ley since long before her unfortunate
marriage to the Earl Russell, and used
to be known as "The Little Duck,"
that being the name of the little
cherry-colored dinghy in which she
was wont to paddle about. Lady Rus
sell apparently lacks the perseverance
of Mrs. Langtry and of Mrs. Brown
Potter.

In the hope of emulating the popu
larity and prestige which the duke of
Abruzzi has achieved by his plucky
expedition of Arctic exploration, the
Prince of Monaco is about to start him
self on a cruise of scientific research
in polar waters, and his yacht, the
Princess Alice, has just been specially
fitted out at Havre for the enterprise.
The prince will be accompanied by no
less than six scientists, one of whom
is Dr. Bruce of the Jackson polar ex
pedition. The others are members of
the Sorbonne faculty, while the French
minister of marine has accepted the
invitation of the prince and delegated
a lieutenant of the French navy to at
tend the expedition. The uniform
which the prince habitually wears, and
in which he is portrayed in nearly all
his pictures, is that of admiral of the
Spanish navy, his rank in that ser
vice being purely honorary.

When Princess Salm Salm was in
this country she had plenty to say
about her first husband, namely, the
prince, but was as silent about her sec
ond marriage that there are few peo
ple, even among her friends and ac
quaintances, who are aware that she
still has a husband who is living. True,
they do not live together, and whereas
she makes her home at Bonn, he
stays altogether in England. His name
is Charles Heneage, and after figuring
for a time in the diplomatic service
and winning some distinction as an
author, is now a journalist. He has
just addressed a long letter to some of
the London papers to defend the prin
cess from the charge of having been
a circus rider prior to her marriage to
Prince Salm Salm. Mr. Heneage de
clares that the princess is really by
birth not, as everybody supposes, an
American woman, but a subject of
Queen Victoria, her father, Colonel
Le Clerc, having been a Canadian, who
at one time held a commission in the
British army. Mr. Heneage, by the
way, was once attached to the British
legation at Washington and was a
suitor for the hand of Miss Le Clerc
at the same time as Prince Salm Salm,
who was preferred to him. Twelve
years later, after the princess had be
come a widow and Mr. Heneage had
quitted the diplomatic service, they
met in Germany and married. Mr.
Heneage is a brother of that Lord He
neage who received his peerage in 1896.
The Heneages are an old Lincolnshire
family.

Let me add, in reply to an inquiry
which reached me the other day, that
the grand cordon, or ribbon, which
the princess wears across the bodice of
her dress from the right shoulder to
the left hip is that of an order no long
er in existence and cannot be worn at
any European court. It is the Order
of San Carlos of Mexico, and was con
ferred upon her by Emperor Maximil
lian. The projected marriage of young
Lord Granville to Lady Sibyl Prim
rose, the eldest daughter of Lord Rose
bery, would be a very popular match.
While she will be enormously rich
through her dead mother, who was
the wealthiest of all the Rothschild
heiresses, the young earl is very poor
indeed. However, he is very good
looking, possesses charming manners,
is as great a favorite at court as in
society, and is already making a name
for himself in the diplomatic service.
He excels as a conjuror, and when a
lad greatly alarmed his family by in
advertently swallowing a half crown
when performing some sleight-of-hand
trick. His father was for many
years foreign secretary, used to be
known by the nickname of "Pussy" on
account of his soft, suave manners,
and twice declined the premiership in
favor of his close friend, Mr. Glad
stone. The present earl's grandfather
was one of the most celebrated and
successful ambassadors that have ever
represented Great Britain abroad dur
ing the present century, and for many
years was as great a political as a so
cial power at Paris.

It was with the late Lord Granville,
by the way, that the famous bishop of
Winchester, "Soapy Sam" Wilberforce,
was riding on that Sunday morning
during church time when he broke his
neck by falling from his horse. Mar

AUTHOR OF "DAVID HARUM"

He Did Not Live to See His Book In
Print.

One of the most striking books of
the season, one that is read from one
end of the country to the other, is
"David Harum." It is hard to realize
after the extraordinary success of the
book, that the dying author had hard
work to dispose of it. Five or six pub
lishers rejected the story. Finally, in
December, 1897, the manuscript was
accepted by D. Appleton & Co., and
their words of commendation were
practically the first that Mr. Westcott
received. At the time he was confined
to his bed, and, while he was much
encouraged by the acceptance, he never
recovered, dying six months before the
publication of his book.

Edward Noyes Westcott was born in
Syracuse, N. Y., September 27, 1847.
He was educated in the public schools.
Necessity compelled him to enter busi
ness, instead of going to college, as he
had intended. At first he was a junior
clerk in the Mechanics Bank of Syra
cuse. His next position was with the
Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York, where he remained two
years. Returning to Syracuse he was
bank clerk, teller and cashier in turn,
and then the head of the firm of West
cott & Abbott, bankers and brokers.
Finally he became registrar and finan
cial expert of the Syracuse water com
mission, a position of considerable re
sponsibility. While in the Adirondacks in the
summer of 1895, Mr. Westcott began
"David Harum." He had sought the
mountains in hope of relief from con
sumption, which thus early had com
pelled his retirement from active busi
ness. Here was an opportunity to fol
low his bent, which hitherto he had
indulged only in his leisure, after the
day's work. The summer produced
substantially chapters nineteen to
twenty-four of "David Harum," the
Christmas dinner and the scene be
tween the Widow Cullom and David.

Returning to Syracuse late in the fall
of 1895 he continued the work at the
advice of friends. Failing health com
pelled him at last to leave all work,
and in January, 1896, he sailed for
Italy, returning in the spring to re
sume the story. It was finished in the
summer of 1896 and after some ex
tensive changes he submitted the man
uscript, comprising some 360 pages, to
various publishers. Each refusal had
a very evident effect on the disease
stricken man. Its final acceptance by
D. Appleton & Co. involved a shorten
ing of the manuscript very reluctantly
consented to by the author. The last
corrections were made practically on
his death bed, and before even the
proofs were ready the end had come.

In appearance Mr. Westcott was of
graceful figure, tall and slender; his
face was intellectual and decidedly
prepossessing. Next to his literary
work music was his chief recreation.
He had a fine baritone voice and was
besides a composer of some note. His
wife, Jane Dows of Buffalo, died in
1890, leaving three children.

Mr. Westcott was a careful and
painstaking writer. First a chapter
was outlined with the pencil, then
typewritten with many additions and
elisions and another revision was nec
essary before it took its final form.
Mr. Westcott put his life and soul
into "David Harum." He died with
no knowledge of his tremendous suc
cess. Few lives among our literary
men have been more tragic. Kansas

OLDEST ANCIENT TIMEPIECE.

When the Alarm is Sounded This
Clock Floods the Room With Light

In the town of Schramberg, in the
Blackforest district of Wurtemberg,
Germany, where one of the chief indus
tries is that of clock making, there has
recently been established an interesting
museum of time-pieces. The collection
displays the gradual development in
the making of clocks for many centu
ries. Among the curiosities are many
of great historical value, there is an
alarm clock constructed in the rear
1800 for the use of travelers. In form
it resembles a lantern, and the interior
is designed to hold a lighted candle.

A joiner and builder of Kansas, Oklahoma, who was employed in building a
schoolhouse at that place, related the following narrative to his fellow work
men one day during noon hour, while they were eating dinner: "Before I
came to Oklahoma, I used to live in Chicago. I worked at the bricklayer trade
and was troubled with dyspepsia a great deal. My head ached terribly at times,
and I did not eat raw vegetables or any kind. I tried all kinds of medicine
with no effect. My case grew rapidly worse; I had to quit work. One day an
old friend of mine visited me and asked me what kind of medicine I was tak
ing. I named a whole list of medicines that had been prescribed for me, all
having little or no effect. 'John,' said he, 'try Elpaso Tablets. You can
get them at the corner drug store.' I sent my little boy to the store and told
him to get me some. He soon came back with them and I commenced to use
them. Before I had used half of the box, I began to get better, and when I
had used all, I was well and went to work again. Since then I have always
kept them in the house. And if you will come to my house,' he said, turning
to a man who had complained of headache, 'I will give you a medicine that
you will have faith in.'"
