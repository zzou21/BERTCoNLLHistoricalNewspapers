chased, and Councilman Scott, after
some days in bed following an operation, also will be present. Mayor
Kleinman will be on hand if another
broncho doesn't step on his neck as
happened last week. Incidentally
there is an immense amount of busi
ness ready in the hands of City Clerk
Carter to be loaded off on tonight's
session.

IN MESA

MESA, July 21. Rev. Francis Bloy,
who, at the request of a number of

men and women interested in the
South Side community hospital, has
taken charge of the subscription cam
paign, visited at their various services
yesterday, the Baptist and Methodist
churches, and the First and Second
Ward chapels of Mesa, and the Lehi
ward, where at each place he met with
a most cordial reception and was given
time to set forth the plan and to dis
tribute cards containing blanks for
pledges.

In his presentation, Mr. Bloy empha
sized the fact that this is to be strictly
a community hospital with directors
elected by the contributors to the fund
who also would have the choice of
selection of a site for the proposed
building. At one of the chapels Dr.
J. Bernard Nelson was present and at
the conclusion of the talk stated that
he is heartily in sympathy with the
move as outlined by the speaker; that
where a real community hospital is in
mind, the entire community will be
benefited.

Since the inception of the idea of a
community hospital, the one great
trouble has been to find people who
could spare the time to take up the
work of a systematic canvass of the
entire south side. Mr. Bloy, while
preaching each Sunday night, is at
liberty until September 1 to give his
time to this work, and a conference of
the various men and women interested,
resulted in turning the matter of
subscriptions over to him. This does not
mean that he is to do all the soliciting

Leo Lesueur Goes to Coast
Leo Lesueur has gone to Los Ange
les for a few days vacation. Mrs. Le
sueur has been there for some time
and will remain for the summer, fol
lowing her husband's return to Mesa
but that the matter is placed in his
charge.
In Mr. Bloy's remarks yesterday he
made plain the fact that he comes
before the various churches as repre
senting the entire south side and not
as the agent of any one church or
group of individuals. Following the
report on the cards distributed yester
day, will come the matter of taking
up the canvass with the people of the
other south side towns.

Boxing Bouts by Local Boys
A number of young men of Mesa
are planning the formation of an ath
letic club, and the first public meeting
will be held on Tuesday night of this

week in the Vance auditorium, when
a number of Mesa young men will en
gage in boxing bouts. A small charge
will be made. None of the receipts
go to the participants, but to the club
fund. The following is the bill of fare
for the occasion:

Al Dana vs. Ernest Bryant, four
rounds; Lafe Le Baron vs. George
Terry, six rounds; Willard Brizzee vs.
Ora Fryer, four rounds; Paul Dana
vs. Dan Skousen, four rounds.

These are all local boys and belong
to some of Mesa's worthiest families.

It is not a rough-house gang, and
should the club be held within the
bounds now proposed, it will doubtless
receive the endorsement of the Mesa
public as well as its financial aid.

Mesa Woman to Return

W. S. McMannon is in receipt of
word from his wife that she will re
turn home within a few days. She
had intended remaining away during
the heated term, but decided that Mesa
and home are a better combination
than can be offered elsewhere, even
during the summer. Meanwhile Mr.
McMannon is full of rejoicing and
housecleaning.

IRON SPRINGS

IRON SPRINGS, July 19. Iron
Springs is in the midst of its summer
rains. Scarcely a day passes without
a shower or a thunder-storm. How
ever, they have not been heavy enough
to do any damage and only help to
make the hills around Iron Springs
greener and the air more refreshing.
The rains have hardened the tennis
courts and they are now being worked
upon and soon will be in the best of
condition for use by the lovers of ten
nis. Few golfers have been seen on the
links as yet, but some excellent players
are expected in camp later, so the golf
links will not be entirely neglected this
summer.
Dancing and horseback riding are
extremely popular. A unique plan is
being tried out by the president of the
club, J. L. B. Alexander, for the en
tertainment of the club members and
visitors. He appointed Mrs. J. L. B.
Alexander, Mrs. John Dennett and Mrs.
E. J. Bennett to arrange for this. They
will decide upon which days to open
the pavilion for dancing, for children
and adults and when to have open
house, so that everybody can meet to
gether for a good time. It is believed
that this plan will be very satisfactory.
Sunday Mrs. A. S. Hawley joined
her daughter, Mrs. Raymond Battin
and Mrs. Earl Hawley, who were al
ready in camp, for the remainder of
the summer.
Mrs. Bradshaw, Mrs. Stahlberg and
families arrived Sunday and have
opened the Burtis cottage, which they
have leased for the season.
Other Sunday arrivals were Mrs. Dr.
Goodrich and Mrs. White, who are
domiciled in the Coggins cabin.
Lyman R. Bennett returned to Phoe
nix Sunday evening, after spending the
week-end with his sister, Mrs. E. J.
Bennett.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry White of Pasa
dena, who were the guests of the E. J.
Bennetts for a week, left Monday.
W. S. Heflin returned to Phoenix
Monday, after a week-end's visit.

Sunday was a cloudy day and just
the day for a horseback ride. Those
who took advantage of it and rode to
Prescott were: Miss Grace Ogg, Miss
Elinor Wallingford, Lieutenant V. W.
Heme and William Ogg.
Those who went to Prescott on Mon
day noon's train were: Mrs. W. S.
Heflin, Mrs. Raymond Battin, Mrs. H.
B. Wilkinson and Harriet Wilkinson
and J. L. B. Alexander.
The young people greatly enjoyed
Monday evening, which was spent at
the home of Mrs. John Dennett, play
ing "five hundred." Miss Helen Lati
mer was the hostess and her guests
were: Mrs. Joe Brown, Miss Ethel
Stabler, Miss Faith Safford, Miss Grace
Ogg, Miss Constance Ebersol, Miss Eli
nor Alexander, Miss Mary Hullet, Miss
Isabelle Irvine, Miss Elinor Walling
ford and William Ogg.
Monday Commander Hays and Mrs.
Hays spent the afternoon riding horse
back. Tuesday Mr. and Mrs. Emory
Hays and Commander and Mrs. Hays
motored to Prescott for the day.
Tuesday the horseback riders to the
mile high city were: Mrs. Faith Saf
ford, Miss Isabelle Irvine, Dick Wal
lingford and Clarence Heflin. In an
other party were Miss Marion Bennett
and Harry Putney.
Tuesday E. J. Collings returned to
Phoenix, after a week spent in Iron
Springs with his family.
Lewis Irvine arrived Tuesday night
to stay a few days with his mother,
Mrs. T. E. Irvine. He left Friday to
spend the week-end in Flagstaff and
will return to camp on Monday.
John Latham returned to Phoenix
Wednesday evening, after spending a
week in Iron Springs with his mother,
Mrs. Mable Latham.
Mr. and Mrs. Earl Wiatt and little
Geraldine and Earl Jr., were Prescott
visitors Wednesday and Thursday.
Wednesday Mrs. Garland B. Couch
had as her dinner guest Lewis Irvine.

The youngsters in camp enjoy hiking.
Those who spent Wednesday morning
in that pastime were Ruth and Inez
Couch, Charles and Marquis Stahlberg
and Dorothy Bradshaw.
Mrs. L. H. Chalmers and Louie
Chalmers contemplated leaving last
Sunday, but they were detained. Un
less something unforeseen happens they
will leave Friday by car for San Fran
cisco. Mrs. Culley Stabler will return soon
for a short stay in Phoenix. Mrs.
Stabler, who is the chief librarian at
the Phoenix High school, is superin
tending the installing of several new
book cases, and for that reason it is
necessary for her to be there for a
short while.
Mrs. E. J. Bennett entertained in
formally Thursday afternoon.

A jolly crowd motored to Prescott
Thursday evening to attend the show
and dance. The trip was made in Mr.
Wise's taxi. In the party were: Miss
Mary Josephine Collings, Miss Ethel
Stabler, Miss Marion Bennett, Miss
Mary Hulett, William Ogg, Harry Put
ney and Lewis Irvine.
The Indian girls in the camp were all
excited and worried until late Friday
afternoon awaiting the outcome of the
doctor's examination of their hero,
Lumbago's pet canary "Judy." Judy
is a Rocky Mountain canary. While
hauling grain up a hill, a rattlesnake
frightened Judy and she moved her Ben
Hur chariot with a burst of speed en
tirely new to the contraption. All was
going well, Lumbago was proud of the
speed his mule could make, but alas,
such bliss could not go on for long,
and it didn't. No, indeed, a pesky rock
found its way 'neath the spinning
wheel and in an instant the chariot was
upside down so was Judy. Lumbago
soon righted his precious mule but the
chariot will have to live in peace with
a broken limb. The doctor said that
Judy will soon be up and around again
probably by Tuesday for the dance.
We all hope so.

An attractive handbook entitled "On
Arizona Ranges" has just been issued
by the college of agriculture of the
University of Arizona. The booklet is
printed upon fine paper and is full of
illustrations of Arizona range scenes.
The booklet calls attention to the
coming livestock meetings and dem
onstrations by the "livestock squad."

The "livestock squad" is a party of
specialists on livestock subjects who
will make a trip of a month beginning
August 11th through the state holding
public meetings with the stockmen.
The agricultural extension service of
the university through the county
agents; the forest service through the
supervisors and rangers; and the live
stock sanitary board through the live
stock inspectors, are all cooperating
to make the "livestock squad" trip and
the livestock meetings a success. Last
year sixteen meetings by the "livestock
squad" brought out 705 stockmen to
the meetings. This year eleven of the
fourteen counties of the state will be
visited.
The specialists on livestock sub
jects will include E. O. Wooton of
Washington, D. C.; F. C. Bishopp of
Dallas, Texas; Dr. J. P. Jacks, Bureau
of Animal Industry; Dr. R. H. Williams,
C. I. Tickrell, E. P. Taylor of the uni
versity, and Paul G. Redington and
others of the forestry service.
Range cattle, sheep and goat men of
the state should attend the "livestock
squad" meetings as they pass through
their part of the country.
The booklet "On Arizona Ranges"
gives the exact route of the "livestock
squad" with places where public
meetings will be held.
Students or stockmen who wish to
take the trip with the "livestock squad"
over the state should file their names
and get further information from
Dean D. W. Working or Dr. R. H.
Williams of the college of agriculture.

(Detroit News)
The first known discovery of petro
leum in California was made in 1863,
by a Mexican hunter, who had followed
a deer trail to the head of Pico canyon,
in Los Angeles county, near the pres
ent town of Newhall. He came on a
seepage of sticky fluid that was un
known to him. Prompted by curiosity
he collected a small quantity of it and
took it to the mission settlement at
San Fernando. There a man who had
formerly resided in Pennsylvania iden
tified it as petroleum and at once
formed a company and staked out
claims. In 1870 a shallow well was
drilled at the head of Pico canyon and
is said to have produced at the time of
drilling between 70 and 73 barrels of
oil a day.
