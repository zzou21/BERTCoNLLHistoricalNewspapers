WORK WITH THE "HONOR
CONVICT" SYSTEM I
(By F. G. Twitchell, Division Engineer)
As the i.redominating interest, from
the average standpoint, in the use of
c nvii t labor on public works, lies in
the efficiency of the labor, rather than
it what is generally termed the "uplift"
of the prisoner, these remarks will leal
principally with the cost of doing work
with convicts under the "honor" sys
tem, this being the term that custom
has applied to the plan whereby pris
nncis are placed in camps without
guards, reliance being put upon their
word that they will not run away, and
that they will conduct themselves pro
perly. The figures presented are taken from
tin- ieiords of the camp known as
Prison Road t amp No. 1. This camp
was organized in December, 1913, on a
s-mull basis, with the intention' of us
ing it for general repair work, and
minor improvements. When first put
in the field it was made up of twenty
nine men and eight teams, under the
direction of one foreman. Since that
time it has expanded until it now lias
a force f fifty-five men and twenty
four teams, under the direction of three
foremen, and is capable of handling
and has handhd, any class of road
work.
Acting upon the principle that if a
prisoner is worthy of t.eiur; trusted he
is worthy of being trusted to the fullest
extnit. the ordinary prison rules have
not been enforced in this camp. The
endeavor has been to- avoid as far as
I of sille anything that would keep the
man onstantly conscious that he was
a prisoner, responsibility for his ac
t'ems has been placed upon himself. I
might say that lie has been shown his
feet. :.nd to stand upon them.
C.irr;. inr; out this idea, the men are
dressed in civilian clothes, and with
two exceptions are not restricted any
more than in a free labor camp. The
first of those two exceptions is that
there is a set hour for going to bed,
"nd the second is that the men are not

allowed to leave camp without permis-

re'ation to the cost of keeping a prison

er in a road camp, the expense being
nearly four times as great in the latter
case. Laying aside the fact that a
prison is a large plant in a fixed loca
tion, with easy access to supplies, and
that large operations allow low unit
costs; end on the other hand the road
camp is a small plant, constantly on
the move, with heavy transportation
expenses both for men and material,
the outstanding reason that it costs a
great deal more to keep a man on the
road is that this man on the road is
doing rough, hard, manual labor, lie
needs a lot to eat. and he wears out a
lot of clothing.
On the Glc.be-Roosev!t highway iast
year it cost us "8 7-10 cents per day to
keep a man, this covering food, cloth
ing, medicine, tobacco and the night
watchman. This cost per day was for
every prisoner in camp, including the
camp force of cooks, flunkies, etc., who
are generally known as "non-producers",
and for every day in the year, in
cluding Sundays and bad weather days
when no work was going on. The cost
per man working day. by which I mean
the cost of putting the prisoner on the
job. for every day he actually worked,
was $1.29. I wish to remind you that
this working day cost had to include
the cost of the camp force on warking
days, and the cost of maintaining the
whole force on Sundays, on days when
the weather would not permit of work,
and on days when the camp was mov
ing. I might mention here that dur
ing the period of thirteen months re
ferred to the total number of days lost
from these causes was ninety-seven, or
twenty-five per cent of the total time
the camp was in operation on this Job.
It also had to include the cost of
transporting the men from the prison
to the camp, which amounted to a total
of $1252, or 15 4-10c per man working
day.
With this information, and taking In
to consideration the facts that the
work was largely repair work and re
construction, that it was scattered over

some thnty miles of road, that the av

sion, and then cjily to the extent of a j erase water haul was three miles, anl

one mile free range. Under no circum
stances are they ullowed to go to town.
One guard, who acts as night watch
man for the camp, is employed, whose
principal duty, outside of this, is to
look after the clothing and equipment
of the men.
The food furnished is on a par with
that furnished in the best free labor
camps, and better than that furnished
in many. We have i een criteiized a
grat dial on this point, though I be
lieve this criticism has been without
proper reflection. The average idea is
that any kind of fcod is good enough
for a prisoner, but that idea is based
upon altogether wrong premises. It Is
not a prisoner that is being fed, but a
workman, and this is a fact that must
never lie lost sight of. It is probably
not necessary for me to remind you

the ave.age supple haul was twenty-

one miles, we will take up the most im
portant matter of all, that of unit
costs.

for some fifty-seven acres was $9.18

I Solid rock excavation, total quantity

woik was so located that full benefit
could be derived from the necessary
drilling and shooting, the cost ran from
65 cents to 85 cents per yard. When
it consisted largely of shooting off pro
jecting .points, and widening the road
at narrow places, the cost was from
fl.25 to $2.50 per yard. The average
cost for the total quantitv moved was

State Auditor Divides to
Issue AVarrants for Those
Which Come Under First
Rule Laid Down by the
Court's Decision.

Satisfied that he has sufficient
authority under the recent order of
the superior court. State Auditor
Callaghan yesterday issued warrants
for the payment of claims presented
by most of the state departments
under the appropriations bill. The
claim which the auditor decided to

honor are those included under the
first of the court's findings of law;
namely that the appropriations made
by the legislature and approved by
the governor as to the amount of
money, constitute the appropriations
for the next two fiscal years. Twen
ty five items come under this clas
sification, and only such appropria
tion items as were vetoed in their
entirety by the governor are now

affected.
The auditor's decision to honor
such claims as fall under the first
rule resulting in a material relief
of the financial situation at the
state house. The only departments
now affected are the tax commis
sion, office expense; the national
guard; the board of control, travel
ing expenses and funds for publish
ing minutes; and the corporation
commission clerks.' As to the last
item it was stated that the auditor
would probabbly issue his certifi
cates for the amount of the claim,
as there appears to be sufficient
authority for the state to incur an
indebtedness for that purpose, even
though there be no appropriation
covering the item.
The first claims paid yesterday
were those presented by Custodian
Keenp in connection with the main
tenance of the capitol building and
grounds, and the salary claim of
Charles R. Osburn, citizen member of
the board of control. A number of
other salary claims were paid, and
claims were being drawn up yester
day. These will be issued as ra
pidly as possible.

The decision of the auditor
pay claims under the 25 items

which the appropriations made
the legislature were sustained

the court is not taken to indicate
that no appeal will be taken to the
supreme court. It was pointed out
yesterday that while there is noth
ing to prevent the auditor from is
suing his certificates as directed bv

the court in I lie map of nil Iha

several items, there would always
be some measure of doubt until the
case was passed upon by the higher
court. Formal notice of appeal was
filed in the superior court last week
but as the auditor has until next
Saturday to perfect his appeal it is
probable that he will tak? the full
:" to a consideration of the ques
tion. In case the auditor decides to is
sue his certificate in those cases
where there yet remains doubt as
to the existence of an appropriation.

the holders would probably attempt
to negotiate the paper at some bank.

It is not known what the attitude

of the business men would be to

ward these certificates but it is be

lieved they could be realized upon.

Teking up th- matter of cost, which
is of course of the ftrs importance,
there is one point to which I wish to
call your particular attention. The ag
gregate cost of road work is made up
of many items, the most important of
wl.ictj are cost of labor, cost of teams, I
cost of material and cost of superin- .
tendence. The cost of teams, material
and superintendence is as great in a '
orison labor camp us it is in a free
labor camp, leaving the cost of labor
at: the only item on which we can ef
fect :i saving. At first glance this might
be supi-csed to be very large, but when
compared with Ihe total cost of a piece '

of work it does not show up to as great
an extent as anticipated. To demon

It is probably because the unspeak
able abuses in Haiti have been com
mitted in the name of liberty that the
i United States has been loath to in
tefere. Discussing the sort of free
'and democratic government maintain
ed in Haiti, one of the oldest officials
of the state department remarked:

"In a century of independence, the
sole right which those people have
saved for themselves is the right to
go to the devil in the way they choose.
And they hold this to be their dearest
light. Any other right can be taken
without protest, but let it be insisted
i that they behave themselves and they
I become worse than a nest of hur
nets." i Apart from the humanitarian phase
of the Haitien problem, there are con
sideration demanding action by the
United States which are of deep if
I not vital importance to this govern
ment. Since the birth of the German
j imperialistic policy in 1900 the activi
ties of the Germans in Haiti have
made it more and more evident that
t was essential for the United States

to protect its interests in cms mue
island of the C'arribean.
The harbor of Mole St. Nicholas is

j the key to the Haitien problem. There

the Germans have for years been
strengthening their grip, and now con-

' trol practically all the trade. Many
: Germans have married native Haitien
I women in order to enable them to own
'property o the island. It is charged
I that they have financed one revolu

tion after another, wtien tne go em

inent in power refused to aoide ty

their will. In this way huge debts

have been oiled on the republic at

hiE-h rates of interest, which hav

steadily weakened the governmnt and
brought it further and further into

has begun to find it very disagreeable
to its interests to have the Germans
in such relationship to the harbor of
Mole St. Nicholas, particularly since
the Panama Canal was built.
In 1911 the United States first in
sisted upon obtaining a representation
in the financial operations sustaining
tile Haitien government. This was done
on the same theory that it was at
tempted in China, namely, that if the
United States had a direct interest in
loans, it could check any move on the

ra.rt of the other creditors tnat were

inimical to American interests. The
United States obtained a minority in
terest. The European interests, Ger

man and French, prevailed.

When the 1911 measure proved un
successful by reason of a succession of
revolutions financed largely by Haitiei

mercha-nts, the United States contem
plated consolidating the entire debt of
the republic, refunding it through a
loan from a first-class American house,
reducing the rate of interest so that it
would be less burdensome to the Hal
lien people, and handling through
American agents the collection and
disbursement of the customs, in order
to end the grafting which was ruining
the country.
The fact that such a scheme would
have ended the grafting was enough to
earn the opposition of all the Haitien
politicians. Efforts were repeatedly
made to carry the scheme through.
Finally the European war put a tem
porary end to European opposition and
now the French interests are willing to
sell out. Rut the Ilaitiens are still op
posed to the plan.
