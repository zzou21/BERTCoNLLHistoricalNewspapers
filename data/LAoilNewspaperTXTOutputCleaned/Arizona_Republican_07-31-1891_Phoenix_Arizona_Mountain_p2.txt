question but that grading on the North

Each week sees some new enterprise
in development toward fruit culture.
The people of this section are wide
awake to their opportunities and pro
pose to pursue them.

San Diego will probably get her iron
foundry. We trust she will. San Diego

vantages to be prosperous; climate included.

OUR FRUIT IS DENVER.
The following clipping from the Denver
Republican shows how the Phoenix
country is looked upon by Denver.
A shipment of early grapes was made a short
time ago from the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona,
to this city. It is said that the Salt River valley,
in which Phoenix is situated, can send Muscat,
Tokay and Malaga grapes to the Eastern
markets a month in advance of California. If
this be true, the cultivation of such grapes will
become an extensive and profitable industry in
a few years in that locality. It is only recently
that the country around Phoenix came into
prominence as a fruit region, but since then it
has attracted much attention. It labors under
the disadvantage of poor rail connection with
the rest of the world, but the situation in this
respect will soon be improved by the con
struction of a branch of the Atlantic & Pacific
from Prescott to Phoenix.
The fact stated that Phoenix can ship
fruit a month earlier into eastern
markets is true and that is one of the
bases of prognostication of future
wealth for this section. The fruit val
leys of Arizona have the natural advan
tage over any other section in the coun
try and the people are just awakening
to the fact. What is required now is to
push our fruits to the front and liberally
advertise their advantages.

Iowa shippers of grain and cattle have
arranged to bring suits to recover money
paid railroads as discriminating rates
for a number of years, the Federal
Courts having decided they can recover.
The rebates are estimated at $1,000,000.
If enforced, this decision will do more
to break up discrimination than any
work of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, although presumably the Inter
state Commerce law gave the ground
for the decision. Of course the decision
is as applicable in one State as in
another.

PRESIDENT PELLEGRINI, of the Argentine
Republic, thinks that his country
has touched financial bottom, and that
there must soon be a change for the
better. The reckless incurring of debt
and issuing of paper money, land-mort-
gage notes, etc., has been stopped. Ap
parently the Argentine lesson has not
been lost in the United States. Little
advices from various parts of the coun
try indicate that the project of issuing
government money against property
values is meeting a reaction.

Chicago has the first train of steel cars
on exhibition. It is claimed that they
cost no more than wooden ones. Of
course they would not burn in case of
collision, nor would they splinter so badly as wooden cars.
There is room for improvement in de
tails of railway transportation. A great
deal of money has been spent in sumpt
uous paneling, painting and upholstery,
which might have been devoted to
securing greater safety.

A quantity of interesting telegraph is
crowded out this morning to give place
to a report of the Dr. Helm examination,
which is the all-absorbing topic just
now. Argument for the defense was
begun last night by Attorney Baker and
will be concluded today by Mayor
Campbell. The case will close with
District Attorney Cox and Judge
Earley.

The failure of the French Senate to
act upon the new duties on American
pork will defer the opening of French
ports to that product until next January,
or later, unless a special session should
be called in the meantime, which is not
likely unless some European compli
cation should arise.
An applicant for naturalization papers was refused by a Ventura Judge be
cause he could not speak the American

tongue.

Two slight shocks of earthquake
were felt at Yuma yesterday and one at
San Diego. No damage was done.

San Diego will probably get the next
annual meeting of the National Educa
tional Association.

The people want the news and they
will get it if they read the REPUBLICAN.

Be in The Republican if you want
the news.

A REPORT OF THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT ON FARM PRODUCTS.
The report of the agricultural department on the growing crops says this
which may be of interest to farmers:
The condition of this crop has slightly
improved during the past month, the
average now standing at 80.7 against
88.3 at the same date last year and 81.9
in 1888. If it is a condition which if
maintained, will give a yield somewhat
above the average, and with the large
increase in acreage noted last month the
crop should be the largest ever made.
This should be extremely gratifying to
growers in view of the fact that impor
tations of Canadian barley have now
reached a minimum on account of the
change in customs regulations. In Cali
fornia, where one-fourth of the crop is
grown, condition is very high and the
outlook extremely favorable. The un
favorable spring injured the crop some
what in Wisconsin, the second State in
production, but in Minnesota and Iowa
a large yield is promised.
Arizona is justly interested in the
culture of barley and these reports are
encouraging to her farmers.
In speaking of potatoes the report
says in regard to the Pacific coast:
The gain in the Pacific States is 3.1
over 1890, but, on the whole the gain,
as stated is but little more than 1 per
cent, which in this respect gives better
promise for prices than increased
abundance.

A RAILROAD ACCIDENT.
Engineer Killed and Fireman Seriously Scalded.
Ashland, Or., July 30. The eastern
railroad accident that has occurred on the
Southern Pacific line, over Siskiyou
mountains, happened today and resulted
in the death of John Rochefort and the
serious injury of the fireman Fritz Pat
rick. Just as the passenger train had
entered a long tunnel, the engines par
ted from the train and the coupling
chain broke when an attempt was made
to retouple in the tunnel. The train
was pulled by two engines and the
dense smoke from the rear engine en
veloped the occupants of the head en
gine and they were not able to endure
it. For 15 or 20 minutes that train was
detained in the tunnel, and engineer
Rochefort and his fireman, Fritz Patrick,
attempted to climb down from the cab,
but were so nearly suffocated that they
fell in darkness. Rochefort with his
left arm across the rail. The rear en
gineer did not know the condition of
the men in the head engine and in back
ing out of the tunnel, the driving wheel
of the engine ran over and cut off Roche
fort's left arm. He was dead from loss
of blood when found. Fritz Patrick is
doing well and will come out all right
it is thought. Several other trainmen
were nearly overcome in rescuing their
comrades, but all came out safe.

A General Fight.
Catawba, S. C., July 30. At the
Alliance barbecue at Prosperity, New
berry County, today a serious cutting
affray occurred between James Hunter
and Morris; It was caused by an old
feud between these parties. Hunter
struck Morris on the head with a
club and seriously injured him. George
Morris received a bad cut in the face
and neck which may prove fatal. H.
M. Singley rushed in to stop the fight
and was seriously or perhaps fatally
cut in the throat. F. Julius Spring
was cut in the back of the head while
trying to stop the fight, and several
others received minor injuries.

A Fight In Oregon.
Walla Walla, Wash., July 30.
Early this morning Billy Lane, an unknown,
fought eleven rounds with gloves just across the Oregon line. The
first two rounds were in Lane's favor,
but in the third round he began to
weaken, and the sixth he was almost
knocked out by Pool. From that time
the fight was all in Pool's favor. At the
end of the eleventh round, the referee
noticed Lane put something into his
belt and upon examination it was found
he had been using a piece of iron in his
right glove. The fight was immediately
awarded to Pool. Lane's face was badly
disfigured.

HIS descendant of George Washington dead.
New Orleans, July 30. The Victor
une's Dominion, Tex., special says:
Martha D. Washington, of this city and
widow of the late Dr. Washington, died
here today, aged 71. Deceased was the
wife of the grandson of the illustrious
father of this country and perhaps the
most direct descendant, as the home in

this city contains a sword, several letters
and other articles belonging to General
Washington.

Poisoned by Canned Beef.
Auburn, Placer Co., July 30. Reports from
different parts of Placer County show
that fifteen persons manifesting sym
ptoms of poisoning after partaking of
pressed canned beef prepared by a
butcher of the town Loomis. A child
of Mr. Free died yesterday and it is
feared other fatalities will be reported.
It is believed that the beef cattle
had absorbed grass-hopper poison.

$6000 Reward.
Washington, July 30. Secretary of
the Treasury has directed the payment
of $6000 to James McIntosh, of San
Francisco, as a reward for information
which resulted in the seizure at San
Francisco of opium valued at $16,602.
This is the maximum informer’s fee al
lowed by law.

At Wanamaker's!
The weather tomorrow is likely to
be so so.
The boom is improving sterling.
Spring is the season when the young
man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts
of love. The voting woman's imagina
tion is more practically directed towards
the numerous spring openings and con
templation of the bargains counter.
Now is the time to advertise. Buyers
are looking for bargains, and they naturally
turn to these columns for announce
ments. You can expect them to
look you up and ask if you have any
thing to sell.
Style is of paramount importance in
advertising. We have been giving some
striking samples of the possibilities in
the line lately. Probably they have
caught your eye. That's what they're
for. This particular form of advertising
has worked wonders in John Wanamaker's business, and is known as the
Wanamaker style. It has made his for
tune. Advertising will make your for
tune if you have energy and nerve.
Top of column.
Such a location is very desirable and
rather expensive, but it is cheap at any
price. If your goods are all wool they
deserve to rank high in our columns.
But to a well worded and tastefully de
signed advertisement position is not
essential. It will attract attention
anywhere.
Next to reading matter.
Shrewd advertisers have a predilection
for placing their announcement as
nearly as possible to genuine reading
matter, where it appeals insidiously to
the wandering eye of the reader and
distracts his attention from the Crisis
in Europe to the Crisis in Cardi Tow
ellings or the latest thing in Haberdash
ery. Speaking of tending notices.
We can put your announcement in
plain words, in plain type and in plain
sight of every casual reader. This form
of advertising proves exceedingly re
munerative in some cases.
Upon the paper
The advertiser who has sufficient faith
in the integrity and discretion of our
accomplished foreman to trust to his
judgment in the location and display of
advertisements never gets left in the
long run. Change is a law of nature,
and it is well to apply it in your busi
ness announcements. Vanity is the
spice of advertising.
