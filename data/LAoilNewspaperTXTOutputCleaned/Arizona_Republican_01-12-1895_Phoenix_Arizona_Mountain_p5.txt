THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN: SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY 12, 1895.

THE BEST THEY COULD,

What It Is to Be Well Thought of In
One's Own Community.
Probate Judge Crouse knows what it
is to be popular in the community in
which he lived. The probate judge has
long been a resident of Mesa and so
endeared himself to the people of that
incorporated village and vicinity that
upon his accession to office the whole
unmarried population arose as one man
and one woman, or as one bridegroom
and one bride to make that office profi
table. Since he was installed there has
been mighty little going on in Mesa but
marrying and giving in marriage in
which respect alone, that pleasant
village has been rendered notoriously
unlike the kingdom of heaven. But
that was the best the Mesa people
could do to express their appreciation
of their former townsman. There are
only three general avenues through
which fees can flow into the office of the
probate judge, the avenues of death,
insanity and matrimony.
It is unreasonable to expect that if
they had loved Judge Crouse ten times
as much that the residents of Mesa
should have committed suicide to throw
their estates into probate court, or that
they should have gone crazy in order
that the probate judge might derive
fees for committing them to the insane
asylum. They naturally selected ma
trimony as the means by which they
could substantially testify to his worth
and merit as a citizen and every body is
happier in consequence.

who has been visiting relatives at Tuc
son. They will return to Phoenix next
week and remain until the close of the
legislative session. Dr. Wright Repre
sented Cochise in the Seventeenth and
notwithstanding the hopeless minority
of his party in that legislature was
among the most influential members
of it.
1894 will go down to posterity
as the year of Vicissitudes,
Hard Trials, Checkered
Careers, etc., etc. We can't
complain, Increased our
stock fifty per cent sold
more shoes than ever. What's
been the cause of our success?
We're too modest to claim it
was our good looks or our
winning ways? Must have
been the shoes we sell.
Don't you think?

A QUEEN'S BATH.

How the Queer Royal Custom Is Observed
in Madagascar.
Since the great African island has
lately caused a great deal of talk it
will not be uninteresting, says London
Tid-Bits, to give some account of the
strange ceremony practiced at the
Malagasy national festival every year,
as related by nearly all the travelers
who have visited the land of the Hovas.
The "Fandroana," or royal bath, was
first instituted by King Katambo, and
is held annually, by royal proclamation,
from November 22 to January 10.
During this time no business is allowed
to proceed. The people of the kingdom
meet the queen in the silver palace on
the first day of the festival, and a red
cock is then brought by the head priest
or sacrificer of the court. Its neck is
wrung, and its blood, being caught in a
banana leaf, is carried to the sovereign,
who touches with it her forehead, neck,
stomach, armpit, finger nails and toe
nails. The rest of the assembly follow
the example.
Next day the people assemble again
for the royal bath in the great palace.
This the queen takes in one of the
sacred corners of the hall, in a silver
bath, being screened from view by
lambas, held by her attendants.
Amid the firing of cannon and the
joyous shouts of her humble subjects,
her majesty then passes along the
balcony, and from a horn in her hand
sprinkles the crowd with the water
she has just been using for her
ablutions, exclaiming at the same
time: "Jasina, aho!" (I am purified).
This sprinkling is said to typify an
abundance of rain during the coming
year.
To be absent from the ceremony
would be to incur the royal displeasure,
so that the French plenipotentiary
minister himself, M. le Myre de Vilers,
who is now again on his way to Mada
gascar, had to submit himself, in 1886,
to this strange ordeal. Every wife,
also, must be with her husband at the
time, or it is considered that she is as
good as divorced. The new year is
then supposed to have begun, and for
several weeks there is a great deal of
visiting and feasting.
Public Testimony of a Public Man
The late Hon. James W. Husted, so
long speaker of the assembly of the
state of New York, was noted for vigor
ous common sense. In January of 1890,
he wrote from the assembly chamber:
"I desire once more to bear my testi
mony to the value of Allcock's Porous
Plasters. I have used them for twenty
five years past, and can conscientiously
commend them as the best external
remedy that I have known. I have
them constantly by me, whether at
home or abroad. My family as well as
myself have found them to be a sover
eign remedy, both for external and in
ternal troubles. I never had but one
kidney difficulty in my life, and the ap
plication of the plasters cured me in a
week. I desire, as I said before, to
bear my testimony in a public way to
their efficacy, and I know of no better
way of doing it than by giving you my
personal experience."

A Want Supplied.
The large two-story brick residence
of Dr. Hughes, situated in Brill's

thrown open as a hospital or

Competent and skilled nurses have
charge of it and expect to make
it a place where the sick
will receive better care than can
possibly be had in private families.
It will be a place where any physi
cian can take his patients and secure
for himself as well as his patients, the
best possible results.

Knows Where to Build.
It is extremely doubtful if any citizen
of Arizona has had greater experience
in building fine residences for himself
than Col. Fitch. He has lived and
built in various states, territories and
climates, as the health of Mrs. Fitch
has not been robust for several years.
In selecting a site for a permanent home
in Arizona Mr. Fitch showed excellent
judgment in deciding upon the Simms
Addition. His residence there will cost
$10,000 and will be second to none in
the territory in excellence of design,
material and arrangement.
