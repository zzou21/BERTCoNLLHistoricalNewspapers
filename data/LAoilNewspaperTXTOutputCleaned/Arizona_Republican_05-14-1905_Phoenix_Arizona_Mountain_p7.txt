A PLEASANT OCCASION.
The Dance and Card Party Given by
the Young Ladies of the Girls' Hall.
One of the most enjoyable social
functions given this season occurred
at the Girls' hall Friday evening when
the young ladies of the hall enter
tained a large number of their friends
at a dance and card party. The mem
bers of the faculty were invited and
each young lady who resides at the
hall had the privilege of inviting one
friend, consequently there were in the
neighborhood of a hundred guests and
each and every one spent an evening
that will be remembered with pleas
ure for a long time to come.
Just before the dancing began there
was the usual failure on the part of
the lights and off and on during the
evening they were out of commission
but ordinary lamps took their place
and the pleasure of the evening was
in no wise interfered with.
The various rooms were decorated
artistically for the occasion and the
decoration committee acquitted it
self with great credit. The walls
were covered with palms and pepper
boughs and roses and other flowers
from the campus had been used in
profusion; the two parlors, one of
which had been converted into a card
room were handsomely decorated as
was also the dancing room. There
were pennants belonging to the young
ladies from many different schools
and they were used in the decorations
to a good advantage. In the center of
the dancing room hung the Normal
pennant and suspended from it and
attached to each corner of the room,
was a rope of pepper boughs. In the
various corners of the rooms and halls
were arranged neat little cosy corners
with Navajo rugs and sofa cushions
in abundance.

As the guests arrived they were
made perfectly at home by Mrs. Jobs
and the young ladies and they then
engaged in dancing and card play
ing as suited their pleasure.
In an adjoining hall to the dancing
room a bowl of delicious punch was
presided over by Miss Gertrude
Sturzenegger and Miss May McCabe.
The music was furnished by W. C.
Wacaser on the violin and Miss Mil
dred Murphy on the piano. It was
splendid and the many dancers thor
oughly enjoyed it.
At half past eleven the dancing
came to a close and the guests depart
ed after one of the most pleasant eve
nings in the history of the Girls' hall.
The young ladies and Mrs. Jobs not
only sustained, but added to their rep
utation as charming hostesses, and the
only regret on the part of the guests
was that there will not be another
dance at the hall this season.

THE BENEFIT CONCERT.
The House Was Packed and the Con
cert was a Grand Success.
The ladies of the Catholic church
have every reason to be gratified over
the result of their benefit concert giv
en in Kingsbury hall Friday evening.
The hall was packed and standing
room was at a premium. The proceeds
after all expenses are paid will be
something over $50.
The program was well carried out
and each participant is well deserving
of the highest praise. It consisted of
music, both vocal and instrumental,
drills and dialogues. Little Welcome
Malley was one of the star perform
ers and was accorded hearty ap
plause by the audience as was also
Miss Critchley of the Normal who
sang a solo. Two dances, one by Mar
ie Bowers and a minuet by Geraldine
Hodnett were features of the even
ing's program and every number re
ceived the enthusiastic approval of
the large audience. The others who
participated in the program were: Ida
Celaya, Erina Hodnett, Rosia Oviedo,
Steven Babcock, Carmela Martinez,
Ofelia Celaya and A. Altamirano.
The music was furnished by Prof. P.
Apodaca, C. Urbano, F. Garcia and
Miss Fannie Brown.
The greater part of the program was
under the supervision of Mrs. S. B.
Malley and its thorough success re
flects no little credit on her efforts.

CLEARED OVER $30.
The strawberry and ice cream social
given in the Armory hall Friday even
ing by the ladies of the W. C. T. U.
was well patronized during the even
ing and after all expenses were de
ducted there still remained a clear
profit of over thirty dollars.

SURPRISED A TEACHER.
The pupils of the grammar grades
of the Rural school showed their re
gard for Miss Alice Curnow, formerly
a teacher in that school but who did
not make application for the posi
tion for the ensuing year, by pleasant
ly surprising her at her home Friday
evening. There were between fifteen
and twenty in the party and they
brought with them a bountiful sup
ply of strawberries, cream and cake.
The evening was delightfully spent
in games and music and it was a late
hour when the surprisers departed.

SOLD HIS INTERESTS.
J. E. Sturgeon consummated a deal
during his recent visit to the damsite
whereby he disposed of his ex
tensive mercantile interests in that
part of the country to Sultan-Newman
and Co., of Roosevelt. Mr. Stur
geon will send out a team today load
ed with supplies and a stacker that
he purchased from the A. H. & V. Co.
yesterday. His hay crop at Living
stone is exceptionally heavy this sea
son and his baler was unable to keep
up with the work.

AN ENCOURAGING SIGN.
If one is to believe in signs, it will
not be more than a day or two until
the dust on the streets of Tempe will
be settled for good and all. Yesterday
afternoon the street sprinkler appear
ed and made a few preliminary
rounds. It was later repaired and will
begin work in earnest tomorrow.

THE JUNIOR TENNIS CLUB.
The members of the Junior Tennis
club picnicked at the Hieroglyphic
springs yesterday. The trip was made
in Finch's tally-ho and the party did
not return until late last evening.
This club has been organized for a
number of years past but as the
greater number of its members grad
uate this year at the Normal this will
probably be their last picnic together.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Sam Miller went to Mesa last even
ing when he accepted a position with

"UNCLE RUBE" A GREAT SUCCESS.
The presentation of "Uncle Rube"
Friday and Saturday nights at the
Mesa opera house was in every way a
success. Friday night particularly
there was a good large crowd, and
they were appreciative of the splendid
work of the players. While the play
has not the "melodramatic" swings, and
has to be well placed to make it at
tractive, yet the players had the audi
ence with them from beginning to end,
and it was seldom where applause was
expected that the actors didn't receive
a hand. Isaac Rogers as "Uncle Rube,"
the Yankee farmer, made a decided hit. Although he made his debut on the stage, he took to it like a
duck to water and had the audience
with him throughout.
Milo Shill, as Deacon Smalley, was
the "real thing," and was applauded
for his characteristic comic work.
Taggs, the Waif, made a kind impres
sion on her audience and blew into
the house by storm in her work with
Upson the Dude, which found a car
icature representation in Almid Lehari,
whose "does it grow on trees?"
brought a round of applause.
Mrs. Janet Johnson and Mrs. Dunn
came in for their share of the applause,
while Lafe Dana as Bub Green made
a great hit. His spar with the dude
was good. Edwin LoBaron as the
young villain was splendid, and al
though but young in stage work, he
has a future before him.
John Matthews as Ike the fireman,
and Bill Tapman backed and acted
their parts to the satisfaction of all.
Mamie Phelps as Millicent and R.
T. Pomeroy as Gordon Gray sustained
their character, and taking it all in
the company is to be congratulated on
the success of the entertainment. Mr.
Janet Johnson, Mesa soprano, "Meet
Me In St. Louis," sang by special re
quest, and was encored when she sang
in her incomparable voice, "I'm Built."
The play was repeated Saturday
night, and the old folks, all over 60
years, were tendered invitations free.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Dr. J. E. Storey of Morenci, Ariz.,
grand prelate of the K. of P. grand
lodge, was a visitor in Mesa yester
day, a guest of J. D. Loper, who drove
him over the country, taking in the
good things that Mesa has to offer.
Ed. W. Jones will leave for the Cerro
Azul Mining property in Old Mexico.
He will remain there for some time
and take charge of the work that the
company is doing on the property.
Quite a number of Mesa people have
become interested in the property.
The young people of Mesa never for
get the old folks. Yesterday invita
tions were sent out by carrier to all
of the old folks over the age of 60
years to attend the Second presenta
tion of "Uncle Rube" free.
Dr. E. W. Wilbur, A. J. Chandler
and W. A. MacDonald were busi
ness visitors to Phoenix yesterday.
W. H. Wallace of Mesa went to the
capital yesterday on business.
O. S. Stapley and Co. are putting up
six headers, which have been sold to
local men who will run them this sea
son around Mesa. It is a good season
when it requires ten new headers and
