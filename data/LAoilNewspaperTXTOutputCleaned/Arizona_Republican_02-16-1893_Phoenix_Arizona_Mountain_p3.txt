THE ETHICS OF TIPPING.
Prospects of an Abuse That Is Hardening Into a System.

Tipping which has hardened into a
system in most of the Atlantic sea
board cities and pervades all large
towns of this country, is born of the
increase in the United States of profes-
sional waiters, says the Philadelphia Press. The race of pro
fessional waiters in Europe is largely
native to three or four small countries
bordering the great nations and speak
ing several tongues. Switzerland and
the Duchy of Luxemburg contribute
much to the corps of professional waiters.
The men speak several tongues, usually
French and German, Dutch or Italian,
and sometimes all four. A few add
to the language which they have learned
at home in childhood a smattering of
English, and thus equipped these men
travel from one end of Europe to the other.
You find great numbers of them in
Paris, some in London, many in Vienna,
thousands in St. Petersburg, and a few
in all the cities, big or little, frequented
by tourists. Some of them turn trans
lators and you may see their signs all
over Paris. They undertake to trans
late almost anything from any of half a
dozen European languages. In this
capacity they are wretchedly paid, and
only a very proud man or a very poor
waiter would consent to change the
latter's employment for that of a trans
lator. Many of these polyglot waiters have
come to the United States, and they have
brought with them their notion as to
their natural right to receive tips. A
naturalized American, unschooled in
the ways of fashionable restaurants at
home and abroad, cannot easily under
stand the attitude of the professional
waiter toward the tip. Tipper and
tipped in Europe view the tip in a dif
ferent fashion from that of the un-Eu-
ropeanized American.
Somebody has said that it is safe to
tip any Briton below the dignity of a
shopkeeper, but an American traveling in
England found that it was well to draw
the line as low as a dean. Mistaking
one of the latter dignitaries for some
thing less than he was the American
fumbled for a shilling after having re
ceived some courtesies at his hands,
but paused when he saw his guide's
face flush and took the hastily-proffered
advice to put his coin in the poor
box.
The colored waiter unspoiled by con
tact with great cities or summer resorts
accepts a tip with a gratitude that
makes the donor feel that it is more
blessed to give than to receive. The
European waiter's attitude toward the
tip is as much beyond that of the un
spoiled colored man as the hovering
tenderness, the respectful yet sym
pathetic and half-familiar interest of
the latter toward the person he serves
is beyond the compass of the profession
al European waiter. The one receives
a tip as his simple due, the other ac
cepts it as a gracious act of generosity.
The Parisian waiter especially re
gards the tips as a right; he not only
knows exactly what to expect but he
does not hesitate to remind a guest who
wants the fee that something is yet due.
The iron rule of Paris is one sou to the
franc, or five per cent, of the price
charged for the meal. In some fashion
able restaurants there is a minimum of
one franc, but in ordinary restaurants
the waiter who serves a two-franc din
ner expects two sous and no more.
In some English inns the custom has
gone beyond this. The guest finds upon
his bill a charge of five percent, for
"service," and is still expected to tip
the waiter.
These details are slowly taking form
in Philadelphia, New York, Boston,
Chicago and a few other cities. Time
was when a malignant waiter went un
fed, but now the fee has become so
much a hard and fast rule that any neg-
lect not serious enough to justify an ap-
peal to the head waiter is entirely ig-
nored. The minimum fee is higher
in American cities than abroad, perhaps
in part because all labor is better paid
here than in Europe, and again because
the tipping system is still something
less than a matter of course here, and
some persons omit the fee. The hard
and fast rule of percentage is gradually
fisting itself upon the restaurants of
large cities and ostentatiously large tips
have disappeared or are disappearing.
It has long been literally true that head
waiters demand a share in the tips of
their subordinates and that all waiters
are paid low wages at fashionable res
taurants because they are expected to
live on tips.
Women waiters find that they re
ceive comparatively few tips from men,
just as male waiters dread the appear
ance of an unescorted woman in a res
taurant. Gallantry makes an American
hesitate to tip a woman, as he hesitates
to yield his traveling bag to be carried on
the shoulders of a slender girl up the
steep, rocky stairs of Capri. Some
men who visit restaurants where the
waiters are women have hit on the
scheme of tipping in a lump at Christ
mas, and doing it very quietly.
One feature of the tipping custom has
thus far made small progress in the
United States—that of leaving a gratui
ty under one's final plate after dinner
at the house of a friend. A young man
at a reception at an interior city con
fessed, however, that in order to be
served by professional waiters hired for
the occasion guests found it necessary
to tip.
DESERT MAIL SERVICE.
The dromedary service in the German territories of southwestern
Africa has given results better than was
expected. The dromedaries are adapted
to the climate, are not affected by the
prevalent cattle diseases, are not made
sorefoot in stony regions and do not
suffer extreme thirst when deprived of
water for a week. They travel, each
carrying a weight of two hundred and
sixty pounds, as fast as an ox team.

A WONDERFUL NEW FAVORITE CONVENIENCE,
The Thonophore Will Carry Messages
Many Different Ways.

To be told that a telegraph wire
which is busily transmitting a long-
distance message can at the same time be made
to convey half a dozen other messages
in opposite directions sounds like a
fairy tale, but that the thing has been
done and is daily being done is at
tested upon the most respectable scien
tific authority. The discovery which
renders these astonishing results pos
sible is due to C. Langdon-Davies, who
has for some years been engaged in
rendering it practically workable and
in adapting it alike to telephonic and
telegraphic use.
It is difficult to convey to the lay
mind, says the Chicago Dispatch, an ac
curate comprehension of a process so
exceedingly technical, but it may be
briefly said that Mr. Langdon-Davies
in the "phonophore" utilizes, not the
electric current, but the noise caused
by the induction. The signals are
transmitted by a series of inducted
electric impulses, and the success of the
system is found in the ability of the in
ductive force to pass through insula
tions which electric currents cannot
penetrate. A wire may be blown down
and in contact with the earth, yet so
long as it is not broken it will carry a
phonophoric message.
By means of the phonophore messages
can be transmitted with extraordinary
rapidity, and there is practically no
limit to the number of messages that
can be sent simultaneously upon the
same wire. And, as we have hinted,
Mr. Langdon-Davies' system is as use
ful telephonically as it is telegraphical
ly. A wire which is conveying electric
signals can at the same time be used for
telephonic conversation without either
the message or the conversation suffer
ing in the least.
For some considerable time past ex
periments in both directions have been
proceeding with most gratifying re
sults, which are vouched for by such
high authorities as Prof. Sylvanus
Thompson, Conrad Cooko and Latimer
Clark. Three of the principal railway
companies have already adopted the
phonophore; and it must be obvious,
even to the unscientific mind, that
phonophoric telegraphy and telephony,
which is so vastly increasing the elec
trician's power over the wires, has be
fore it a very great future.
The phonophore, indeed, increases al
most to infinity the number of words
that can be transmitted in a given time.
It is obvious, therefore, that it opens
great possibilities in the way of cheap
ening the cost of telegrams. So long as
the number of words that could be car
ried by a wire in an hour was rigidly
limited it was hopeless to look for any
substantial reduction in the cost of tel
egraphing, but the phonophore at once
increases the capacity and speed of
every wire to which it may be fitted.
HE WAS WELL RECEIVED.
Therefore Gen. Butler Did Not Deliver
the Speech He Had Prepared.
A good many people, says the Boston
Journal, have heard the story of Gov.
Ames and Gen. Butler when they had
their famous ride to Cambridge after
the refusal of the university overseers
to grant the governor an LL. D. But
here is a new story in connection with
the dinner ex-Gov. Ames' own ex
planation of what was rather mystify
ing to a good many people at the time:
"The real explanation of Gen. But
ler's moderation in his speech at Harv
ard college after the overseers had re
fused him the degree of LL. D. has
never been told in print, I think. I
rode over to Cambridge with the gov
ernor in a landau, and on the way over
I hinted that discretion would be called
for. Butler was rather reticent and
moody, but he replied: 'I am well pre
pared.' I rather expected an outbreak.
But when we arrived and the governor
was received with even more expressions of
regard than usual by graduates and undergraduates alike, he
began to be more genial and approacha
ble, as he was in his role of a private
citizen. At length the dinner was
served, and George Choate, the presiding
officer of the day, paid a most generous
and eloquent tribute to the governor in
his introductory speech.
"Butler turned to me and said quick
ly, just before he arose to speak: 'I
have thrown my speech to the winds.'
"Then followed his model oration
without a fling, without a hit—a schol
arly, eloquent address. It was not till
at Williamstown the next week that I
learned what he meant when he said:
'I have thrown my speech to the winds.'
"He meant that he had prepared an
address which he believed he would be
justified in delivering, an address that
in its scope took in all the sins of that
institution and its management, from
the time of the defalcation of one of its
treasurers down through succeeding
generations. But the hospitable treat
ment he received disarmed him. He
had expected hisses, he received cheers;
he had been prepared for a snub, and he
was complimented.
"With his quick perception he under
stood his position exactly and kept back
the proposed speech, substituting for it
the impromptu, and one of the most'
brilliant impromptus ever delivered."
The Woman Speculator.
A man standing in front of the news
stand of an uptown elevated railroad
station in New York the other day
found himself rudely pushed aside with
out apology, and, looking around with
a scowl, found himself suddenly dis
armed, for the offender was a woman.
She was a small blonde person, clad in
fashionably cut plain skirt, neat seal
skin coat and jaunty hat, ornamented
with a sage-green ostrich plume. She
was daintily gloved, and she carried a
natty silk umbrella. Her rudeness was
explained by her haste to get at the
news stand. She already carried under
her arm several of the morning papers.
She bought the daily Wall street pub
lications, coolly pushed her way
through the crowded aisle of the car to
a place where she found a seat, and
rode down town with a host of fellow
speculators, her eyes fixed upon the
market column.
