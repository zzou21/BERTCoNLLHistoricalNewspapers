SCHOOL NOTES
Uses of Plants to Man
By TERRY RANDLE
(9th Grade)
Plants play a useful part in the
life of man. Besides furnishing
him with commercial products, pro
tecting land, and conserving the
water supply, they help furnish
fresh air and wholesome food.
One of the important parts played
by plants is to help in furnishing us
with pure air. Through their
leaves, plants take in carbon dioxide,
which is poisonous to man. The car
bon they retain for food, while they
set free the oxygen which is the gas
which keeps us alive and makes our
fires burn.
Another essential that plants fur
nish man is water. During the
rainy season, water is held back on
a hillside by leaves and twigs which
have dropped to the ground and act
as a sponge. The roots also help by
loosening the soil and thus causing
the water to soak in more readily.
The plants in this way act as a res
ervoir, letting the water out in a
slow underground stream which
lasts through the dry season. Plants
help us get not only a plentiful sup
ply of water, but also pure water,
because soil bacteria, which are
one-celled plants, destroy disease
germs in the water that passes
through the ground, and therefore
gives us pure water.
Besides these essentials, plants
help furnish us with food. Many
stems, leaves, seeds, and tubers are
eaten by man. Plants furnish us
with most of our carbohydrates, and
some fats and proteins. Syrup is
taken from the maple tree, and
sugar is found in the sugar beet
and in sugar cane. Indirectly,
plants furnish us with meat, for
without grass, rain and water, cat
tle and other animals which furnish
us with food, could not live. Yeast,
also her tiny plant, helps raise our
bread and keeps it from getting too
light and dry.

Another way plants help man is
by furnishing him with clothing,
either directly or indirectly. Cot
ton, linen, and wood-fiber silk are
made from plants. Pure silk,
fur, leather, and wool would be un
known if the silkworm and the an
imals which furnish us with cloth
ing had no plant food.
Plants play a large part in furn
ishing us with food, water, air, and
clothing; but that is not all. Com
mercially, plants are of great im
portance. Paper, with its many
uses, lumber, from which houses
and furniture are made, rubber, and
dyes would be unknown if it were
not for plants. Medicines, such as
camphor, opium, turpentine, and
countless others are obtained from
plants. With medicine, the yeast
plant is a help, because without it
alcohol could not be made.
In addition to the above uses,
plants protect us from strong winds.
They protect hillsides from having
the soil carried away by water, be
cause the roots hold the soil in
place; prevent floods which would
ruin property and kill people, by
keeping the water from running off
at one time; and protect river banks
from being worn away by the action
of water, because they break the
force of the water.
Another use of plants is to make
their surroundings cool and attract
ive. Flowers, grass, and trees make
a place more beautiful. By shade,
and also by letting water evaporate
from their leaves, they make the air
more humid, and thus keep the sur
roundings cooler.
Thus we see that plants not only
help to furnish us with some essen
tials of life, but also greatly add to
our comfort and pleasure.

BIG IRRIGATION PROJECT
FOR CASA GRANDE NEXT
Louis Melczer, Phoenix Capitalist,
Heads Association That Has Se
cured Permit from the Corporation
Commission to Pump Water for the
Irrigation of 130,000 Acres of
Land in the Casa Grande Valley
(From the Arizona Republican)
Electric power, steam generated,
sufficient to pump water for the ir
rigation of 120,000 acres of land, an
area one-half of the cultivated acre
age of the Salt River valley, is to
serve the country surrounding Casa
Grande, and also will furnish addi
tional service for the lighting of
Casa Grande and for other local pur
poses, according to the terms of a
preliminary certificate of conven
ience and necessity just granted by
the State Corporation Commission
to Louis Melczer and associates.
The Casa Grande farmers have
been pumping irrigation water by
means of individual pumping plants
representing a total of about 3,000
horsepower. Distillate fuel was se
cured by them through the medium
of their co-operative organization,
known as the Casa Grande Farmers’
association. The price of distillate
has almost doubled since the last
growing season, and distillate fuel
is reported hard to get at any price,
the situation becoming so critical
that radical measures for relief were
found necessary.
Ready by July 1
Louis Melczer jumped into the
breach at this juncture with a prop
osition to establish a central fuel
plant and to serve the entire com
munity with more power than it has
had in the past. Mr. Melczer is a
former Phoenix business man, presi
dent of the Melczer company, whole
sale grocers, and rated among the
most substantial men in the city.
He recently made a clean-up in oil
properties and went to Los Angeles
to live.
When seen last night, Mr. Melc
zer said he was not ready to give
out a list of his associates in the
Casa Grande enterprise, and that he
could not state yet the amount of
horsepower which he expected to de
velop in the new plant, but that a
unit sufficient for the immediate
needs of the Casa Grande district
would be in readiness probably by
July 1.
The Casa Grande country includes
approximately 120,000 acres of farm
land irrigable by pumping water
from wells at a depth of from 25 to
35 feet. It is believed that more
than 100,000 acres of additional
land can be developed by pump irri
gation. About 12,000 acres there,
it is said, might come under the
ditch from the Florence diversion
dam.
Town Needs Service
The town of Casa Grande, now
lighted by current from a municipal
plant of 80 H.P., is reported inade
quately served and in immediate
need of approximately 5,000 H.P.
for light and other purposes.
According to the certificate grant
ed Louis Melczer, the new plant will
be located adjacent to the railroad,
to facilitate fuel deliveries, and elec
tricity will be served to all territory
within a radius of about 20 miles,
which ultimately would take in the
town of Maricopa.
DAVIS measures accurately for
suits. See the new spring and sum
mer samples.
The minimum wage for male em
ployees in the largest rubber tire
company in Akron, Ohio, is $6 a day.
The heaviest buyers of motor
trucks are coal dealers, grocers,
lumber men, milk dealers and
creameries.
