COMFORT DURING
THE SUMMER IN
PHOENIX POSSIBLE!
It is possible to live with comfort in
Phoenix during the summer season if
people will only supply themselves
with a few conveniences. A woman
stands a considerable part of the day
in the kitchen. A cook stove or range
once heated in the morning keeps the
kitchen hot all day, but with a Stand
ard Wickless Blue Flame Oil Stove that
kitchen might be as cool as any room
in the house. Besides it's being less ex
pensive than a wood cook stove, it is
cleaner, quicker and just as safe. In
the afternoon after the morning's work
is over it is a fine thing to have a ham
mock stretched in some shady place.
To the tired, heated person, there is no
way of reclining so cool and restful as
lying in a hammock. And then with
our dewless nights and cloudless skies
one may sleep out of doors without en
dangering the health and with com
fort on a cot. There are other things
that are conducive to comfort here, but
we haven't the space to mention them.
We want to invite all of our Arizona
friends to call at our store and see our
line of Wickless Blue Flame Oil Stoves,
cheaper than wood and safer than a
lamp. Also see our line of hammocks.
They are beauties at bargains; and also
see our stock of cots—large assortment,
low prices.

KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS. Knights
of Pythias Lodge No. 2 will meet to
night in Castle Hall in the new Horner
building for work in the third rank.

A NEW BUSINESS. W. L. Truitt,
representing a leading paint and oil
company of San Francisco and Los
Angeles, is in the city for the purpose
of opening up a branch establishment
in Phoenix, from which the territorial
trade will be supplied.

COAST EXCURSIONS. Excursion
trains left yesterday over both rail
roads with passengers for coast points.
The number of tourists was not large,
as the season for summer travel is
rapidly drawing to a close.

A SMITH SHOW. Secretary Akers
returned yesterday morning from Flag
staff, where he went to attend the races
and bronco-busting contests. He was
also present at the Wilson–Smith con
test at the primaries and witnessed the
victory of the Smith adherents, not on
account of overwhelming numbers, but
by superior workmanship. W. C. Foster,
who also came in, said that the Smith
snowstorm visited Williams and pre
vailed throughout Coconino county.

THE DEMOCRATIC WAR. Tomor
row is the day of the democratic prim
aries in this county. There will be two
storm centers, one in the Third Ward
and the other in the Second. The Sec
ond Ward voting place will be in the
Gooding building. The fighting among
the faithful has grown so warm that
there have already been personal en
counters, and one harmless and perhaps
meaningless gun play. Tomorrow is
expected to be productive of fun and
flying fur.

RETURN OF LEWIS W. COLLINS.
Mr. and Mrs. Lewis W. Collins, who
have spent the last two months on the
coast, returned yesterday morning.
Mr. Collins is now on the ground to
push his candidacy for the legislature
on the republican ticket. It will not
require a great deal of pushing, for Mr.
Collins is so well and favorably known
and enjoys the confidence of his party
to such an extent that his campaign
may be said to have been made when
it was begun.

NEW CORPORATIONS. Articles of
incorporation of the American Safe De
posit and Trust company, with a cap
ital stock of $250,000, were filed in the
office of the county recorder yester
day. The incorporators are Henry E.
Kemp and J. R. Early of Phoenix and
Martin M. Levering of Manila, Philip
pine Islands. The same incorporators
filed articles of the Philippine Im
provement company, with a capital
stock of $1,000,000. Articles were also
filed by the James Neill Oil company
and the Prudential Oil company.

AN AVIARY. W. L. Pinney is col
lecting an aviary made up of strange
birds. The nucleus of it is a black
crested heron, a beautiful and intelli
gent bird and the only one ever seen in
this part of the country. Yesterday
Mr. Pinney received two important ad
ditions. One is a nondescript fowl, ap
parently a cross between a hawk and
an eagle, more handsome than either.
His breast is a rather bright yellow
and his back and tail black. His legs
are long and he has a top-knot. The
third member of the collection is a
monkey-faced owl.

AN AMERICAN EXPOSITION.
Notification was received at the gover
nor’s office yesterday of the appoint
ment of Governor Murphy as vice
president of the South Carolina Inter
state and West Indian Exposition com
pany. The company is organized under
a charter obtained from the state of
South Carolina and will hold an expo
sition at Charleston, beginning Decem
ber 1, 1901, and closing May 31, 1902. The
scope of the exposition is as broad as
its name and its purpose is to make a
full and attractive display of the ma
terial resources of the states of the Am
erican Union, of the new Spanish pos
sessions in the West Indies and the
Philippines.

THE DOUGLASS CLUB. The Doug
lass Club held a harmonious meeting at
the club rooms last night at which the
previous election of H. H. Harvey as
president was ratified and the follow
ing officers were elected: Vice-president,
Allan Smith; secretary, Perry
Payne; treasurer, Samuel Steele; ex
ecutive committee, C. C. Skaggs, Rob
ert Hudson, Isaac McPinion, Frank
Smith, Andy Walker. H. H. Harvey
was unanimously endorsed as a dele
gate to the county convention.

A LOST RELATIVE. An inquiry
was received at the sheriff's office yes
terday concerning a man named Daniel
West. The inquiry comes from a rela
tive at Auburn, N. Y., who last heard
from West on March 3, 1896. He was
then in the county jail in this city. It
is remembered by officials of the sher
iff's office that a man by the name of
Daniel West was in jail early in 1896, a
United States prisoner, having been
sent up from Yuma county to await
trial in United States court on a charge
of selling liquor to Indians. The charge
was ignored by the grand jury. He
was then old and very infirm.

THE IRON SPRINGS COLONY.
The Iron Springs colony is breaking
up for this season. About thirty mem
bers came in last night in a passenger
car attached to a freight train. They
are enthusiastic over the future of that
mountain resort and are impatient to
get back there again next season. They
believe the population of Iron Springs
will be doubled then. All the desir
able lots have already been taken; that
is, all of them convenient to the
springs, but the world in that vicinity
is wide and many others will no doubt
be willing to undertake the hardship
of carrying water a great distance for
the sake of living there.

BACK TO THE COLD, COLD
NORTH. Senator W. A. Freeze has
sold out his interest in the Palace sa
loon and with the exception of some
real estate, all his Arizona property.
It is the first time he has severed his
business relations with the sun-kissed
land since 1879, but said he last night,
“Nome looks good to me,” and he will
start for Alaska again tonight, stop
ping a couple of days in Los Angeles.
He has some interests in Nome now in
the care of his partners, and he really
intended to return when he came back
a week or two ago. He knows that
Nome will afford a chilly contrast to
Phoenix about the time Santa Claus
makes his round and he has been try
ing to wean himself away from his
Alaskan love ever since he got here,
but the hypnotic influence of the au
rora borealis has got a cinch on his af
fections and the golden sandbanks of
the ice-bound north is the only kind
of scenery that fits his eye. He says
that the difference between Phoenix
and Nome City is simply indescribable,
and the best figure he could think of
was that of a man dropping through a
hole in the earth and coming out on
the other side, wondering where he is
at. But he has dropped through the
hole once with satisfactory results and
will begin a second plunge tonight.

A LETTER FROM NOME. A friend
of David Turner in this city yesterday
received a letter from him in which he
said: “I am now in Nome and it is a
big fizzle for this season. There are
thousands here waiting to get away as
soon as the rates are low enough. Last
week there was a rate man here who
booked passengers to Seattle for $15.
There are a great many Phoenix peo
ple here anxious to get home. There
must be faith in the future of Nome,
for large frame buildings are going up
in every direction. The weather was
mild and delightful up to August 1,
but since then it has been cold and
stormy. The old timers say there will
be no change for the better until win
ter sets in. It is very cold and squally
now and as the town is nearly all built
on a tundra, a mossy peat bog, it is
very easy to sink down to your knees.
That part of the town near the beach
has nice sandy roads. Nearly all the
best mines are in litigation and the
others have not enough rain this sea
son to enable them to wash their dirt.
Outfits of all kinds can be bought
cheaper here than in Seattle, as people
who want to leave sacrifice everything.
If nothing prevents, I will be in Phoe
nix this fall.” In a postscript written
just a week later, Mr. Turner says:
“Since writing the above it has rained
continually. The government trans
port General Lawton will carry 500
people back to the states. They will
only have to pay their board, 50 cents
a day.”

Order your fall suits early. Our first
consignment of fall and winter goods
has arrived. H. G. Feekings, Mer
chant Tailor, 20 N. 1st Ave.
