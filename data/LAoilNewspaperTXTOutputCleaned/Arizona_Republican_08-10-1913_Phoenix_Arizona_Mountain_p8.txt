Get Tempe today.
Take the lead away.
Tempe next!
This is the cold plaint of more than
a thousand Phoenix fans who will
be out to the game at the new
park this afternoon to witness the
real game between the headliners of
the valley, heretofore unbeatable, and
the reorganized local battalion under
the leadership of Silent Ross.
Right here it is very much in place
to remark that the Ritchie
around town last night until 10
o’clock seeing that
Silent Ross was
home and
that all the men of
the Phoenix team bet it
to bed in plenty good time
to be refreshed by the sleep of the night and
ready to battle for the last slim
chance, when the two mortal rivals

W. G. BARNGROVER
“Old Busted Mitt Bill,” With the
Smile That Won’t Come Off.
He Pitches Today.
The fans of Phoenix want to
know how Barngrover came by
his name “Busted Mitt Bill,” so
the sporting editor got Bill in a
corner the other day and made
him tell the story. You see it
was this way. Nearly three years
ago now, Bill was pitching for
the Amarillo team of the Santa
Fe system, and journeyed to Al
buquerque for the purpose of
playing a series against the Albu
querque Grays in the Old Town.
On the way over Bill had an ac
cident and broke his left hand,
in short busted his mitt.
He, however, pitched the full
nine innings against Albuquerque
the first day, winning his game,
all the time with his busted mitt,
mind you. The next day Ama
rillo was in a hole and needed a
hitter in a pinch to win the game
in the last half of the ninth.
Bill was sent in, and holding the
bat in his right hand, he bats
left-handed, with the small end
against his left elbow, the Texas
leaguer made two bases driving
in two men and winning the
game. The sporting editor of The
Albuquerque Journal, now the
city editor of The Republican, im
mediately dubbed Barngrover
“Old Busted Mitt Bill,” and the
name has stuck. That’s the
story.

Phoenix bats today upon the local
diamond.
This is the sort of spirit that ani
mates the team, as all the men are feel
ing confident, in view of an excellent
workout in the afternoon, that Tempe’s
name is going to be “mud” when the smoke
cleared away.
Such was the spirit of the management.
This is the spirit of Dick, alias “Fat”
Vail, and Joe, not far was known as
Sunburn, Kehoe and a few
others. Several of the most ardent
supporters, seeing the past few even
ings, and remembering
the “ginger” displayed in the Mari
copa game on Thursday, went to the
park and cleaned out the grandstand
until it is clean as a new pin, fol
lowed this by making the center sec
tion sun-proof in the interests of
shade, and then made arrangements
for 100 more seats in the stand. All
of this was some work, but it will be
returned in bright and shining silver
by the fanatic fans who will pile into
the stand and grounds this
afternoon to see the locals annex the
“bounding and abutting” goat of the
Tempeites.
There is still another point
of interest. Glance over the batting
order for today and notice that
Tognerio batted fifth before but bats
third now. The chances of a man
getting on before “Tog” comes up
fourth are increased.
If only the first gets on
and “Clean-up Clow” runs over the
bases, then Ferguson follows, and
Ritchie follows, with details;
will put things on the right path again.
Note that every batter when he comes up,
thus increasing the chances of a run.
The strong end of the batting order
is put up that the covers are
“clean-up men” at every
interval, a real practical batting array
is distributed so that Smiling Spikes
will have considerable of his gray
matter to solve that will
be on the matter. So far, so good.

There is another side of the story
that looks good to the fans, and that
is the hole made in the infield of the
Tempe aggregation when Spikes is
taken away from the short garden.
The star pitcher weakens the
team in an instance like that. Yet,
with all this fault-finding with the
Time Triers from Tempe, it must
be admitted that the team is a strong
one, worthy of a whole lot more sup
port from Tempe itself than it gets.
It is an aggregation of gentlemanly
ball players, Salt River Valley boys,
like the others, who play ball for the
sport of it, and for the amusement
and recreation it furnishes their
friends. Many of them lose money
every time they put on a uniform.
Many of them have to lay off when
they play, but they are filled with
Tempe, just as the Phoenix club is
filled with Phoenix, and they come
over to do their best at all times.

Owing to the fact that there will
be no game in Mesa, the Maroons
and Mesa not playing, there will be
a large delegation from both the
spritely settlements on the south side
present at the local park to witness
the game. Then Manager Venne, one
of the most enthusiastic Phoenix root
ers in the country, almost, when his
team is not playing, will be on hand
with the Maroons to help cheer
Phoenix to victory.
Oh, yes, Oscar Irvin promises to
occupy an automobile. Monahan will
be in the stand rooting for the um
pires, whatever that is. Bucky O’Neill
will be on hand to say smart things
about everybody, and everybody will
laugh. It will be a great time.

Prizes Again On
The merchants of Phoenix, in ap
preciation of the work of the ball
teams to furnish good sport for
Phoenix and the Valley, will again
give prizes to the players that espe
cially distinguish themselves.
Pinney and Robinson will give the
batter the choice of any bat in the
house for every fair one knocked
over the fence today. Pinney and
Robinson are sporting goods men,
and carry a good stock of bats.
Morales Mercantile Company of 20
East Washington will give a pair of
50-cent hose for the first player
making a two-base hit. A Durham
Duplex Razor will go to the first
man making a three-base hit in the
game, from the Adams Pharmacy.

Slugging Oaks.
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 9. Oakland
hammered Chech all over the lot in
the last five innings and won from Los
Angeles today 8 to 2. The Oaks got
all the runs in four innings during
which time they batted out twelve hits.
Abies pitched the first five innings
for the Oaks but was taken out after
he allowed six hits and two runs. Loh
man followed him in the box. In the
four innings he pitched, he allowed but
one hit.

A Fatal Walk.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9.—In a hard
fought pitchers’ battle today, Roy Hitt,
the Venice southpaw, bested Bill James
of Portland 1 to 0. Three hits were
gathered off Hitt in the third and
fourth innings, but in all other frames
he held them without a hit. James’
only base on balls resulted fatally. He
walked Ritchie in the seventh inning.
The Venice third baseman stole second
and scored when Patterson shot a
single to right.
Score: R. H. E.
Venice … 1 5 2
Portland … 0 3 0
Batteries: Hitt and Sterritt; James
and Fisher.

Liefield Gets One.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 9.—Jimmy
Johnston beat out infield hits in the
opening of the fourth and sixth innings
and in each case made an extra base
on an error today. Infield outs and
hits by Cochran and Downs chased
him across for San Francisco with the
first two runs. In the eighth a walk,
two singles, Arellanos’ error and
Schmidt’s double registered three more
for the 5 to 1 victory for the Seals over
the Wolves. Liebold hit twice but was
not in the best of shape on account
of his short time in the coast climate.
Henley relieved him, but Liefield gets
the credit for victory, the Seals taking
a one-run lead in the first of the fourth
and holding it safe. Henley did not
relieve Liefield until the opening of
the last of the fourth.
Score: R. H. E.
Sacramento … 1 8 4
San Francisco … 5 12 1
Batteries: Arellanos and Bliss;
Liefield, Henley and Schmidt.

DATES SET FOR
BIG FOOTBALL
GAMES OF 1913
Harvard Figures Cornell
Easier Gamesters Than
Dartmouth and Changes
Dates; Puts Up a Still
Fight on Eve Yale Game
CORNELL–HARVARD
FIRST BIG GAME
Yale First to Open Season
as Usual With Wesleyan.
The Indians Have a Hard
Schedule This Year’s
Smaller Fry.

For the first time in several seasons
two of the best college elevens will
clash at the Polo Grounds, New York
City, when Dartmouth and the Carlisle
Indians play on Saturday, November
15th, the same date that Yale and
Princeton meet in their annual gridiron
battle at New Haven. Dartmouth has
risen steadily in the football world until
the Green Mountain boys are just as
formidable as the elevens of the Big
Four.
Harvard has dropped Dartmouth this
season, principally because the New
Hampshire team gave the Crimson too
tough a battle on the eve of the Yale-
Harvard game. Instead, Harvard has
taken on Cornell, a team which will not
give the Cambridge eleven so much
trouble.
The first big game of the season will
be played on November 1st, when Cor
nell meets Harvard at Soldiers Field, in
Cambridge. On November 8th Harvard
will play Princeton in Jungle-town, and
on the following Saturday, November
15th, Yale and Princeton will play at
New Haven. The Yale-Harvard game
will be played at the Stadium, in
Cambridge, on November 22. On
Thanksgiving Day, the annual Cornell-
Penn game will be played at Franklin
Field, Philadelphia. On the Saturday
following, Navy vs. Army will be
played at Franklin Field, and this last
game will mark the close of the foot
ball season.

Yale First to Open Season
Yale is the first of the big college
teams to open the season, the Blue
clashing with Wesleyan at New Haven
on Wednesday, September 24th. The
season will be in full blast on Saturday,
September 27th, when all the big
elevens will get under way, Yale play
ing Holy Cross, Harvard playing
Maine, and Princeton clashing with
Rutgers.
The Army team will also open the
season on this date, playing Norwich
at West Point. The Navy opens the
season with University of Pittsburgh.
The Army, after several years of desul
tory schedules, is going to follow the
policy next season, and there will be
a few hard games in the soldiers’
schedule.
The first of the army’s big games will
be with Notre Dame, at West Point, on
November 1st.

Tough Schedule for Indians
The Yale schedule this year is not
especially hard, although the Elis will
get a hard preliminary tryout with
such teams as Lafayette, Lehigh,
Washington and Jefferson, and Brown.
Harvard will have Cornell, Brown and
Princeton as important opponents be
fore the final game with Yale.
The Carlisle Indians, as usual, will
have the toughest schedule of any of
the college teams, and Glen Warner’s
fellows will be without the
services of the great Jim Thorpe. The
Indians play Cornell at Ithaca on Oc
tober 11, Pennsylvania on October 18,
Dartmouth at the Polo Grounds on
November 15th and Brown at Provi
dence on Thanksgiving Day.

Pennsylvania has tried to schedule
games with some of the larger teams,
but has not been able to interest
Yale, Harvard or Princeton. Penn will
play Dartmouth at Franklin Field on
November 8th, the same day that Har
vard plays Princeton.
Each Saturday during the fall season
will see all the teams in action, and
with the rules in their present satis
factory shape, gridiron sages look for
a very successful season. Last sea
son’s revision made the game as safe
and sane as it is possible to make
such a vigorous sport, and very few
serious injuries or fatalities resulted.
