We have a fine line of goods and
our excellent services.

The new building of the Morenci Club
was formally opened on Monday of last
week with a programme, the main fea
ture of which was a lecture by Dr.
Waldo-mar Lindgren on "The Clearing
of History of the Morenci District."
This opening event had been looked
for and looked for anxiously by the people of
the camp for a long time, but the
highest expectations were fully
satisfied by the magnificent club building which
contains a large room and library, sup
plied with all the leading daily papers
and monthly magazines, as well as the
standard novels and scientific journals.
There are also about fifteen hundred
volumes of choice fiction, history, bi
ography, etc., in the circulating library in
connection with the club.
The main floor in addition to the
public reading room is located the gymnasium,
supplied with the most modern
apparatus for the purpose of exercise for
the body.
The baths fitted promptly. There is also on the same floor the
dance hall admirably adapted for its purpose.
Its attendants, the librarian's office occupies a central
position on the main floor and chairs
are placed in convenient sites to receive visitors.

This fine building is the finest
located for the bowling alleys, billiard and
pool tables, the bath rooms and the
pool room parlors, which are
fitted with the necessary apparatus for
various purposes.

The kidneys can safely be said to be the kidneys.
Kidneys filter the blood.
Keep the human system healthy.

If the kidneys fail to do their work they result in backache, dizzy spells and urinary troubles.
At the first backache and urinary disturbance get Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root.

Most backache pains are kidney ills.

Twitches, neuralgia, pains and weakness of
every form of kidney ills.
Here is proof of this:
Mrs. M. J. Riley, midwife, living at 11
South Main Street, St. Johns, says:
"Backaches in following my confinement from
its births, had my kidneys in bad shape and
I was miserable. I had tried everything to no
avail. I began taking Swamp-Root and was relieved
at once. My kidneys were soon in good shape.
I advise anyone suffering to try Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root."

Loved is the Birthright

Every Woman

When disease attacks her, and scratches
wrinkles on her face, and tears off the flesh
which made her plump, she has lost a charm she
can never regain.

Disease attacks her fair features through the Liver
and Kidneys, or is always accompanied by an attack
on them. To win back beauty, to beat off the monsters
which assail it, cure the Liver and Kidneys first.
Liver and Kidney troubles are increasing to an alarming
extent, especially among women, largely because of the ex
citement and worry of American life. Liver and Kidney
troubles are dangerous. A diseased Liver, or disordered Kid
ney makes the blood thin and watery. This irritates the action
of the heart, and often when a case is diagnosed as heart
trouble or failing nerves, or female weakness, it is simply
a case of Liver and Kidney trouble.
DR. McLEAN'S
Liver and Kidney Balm
Made by The Dr. J. K. McLean Medicine Co., St. Louis, Mo.
A sure cure for $1.00 per bottle. For all diseases of the Liver and Kid
neys, and for all female ailments wherein good blood and regularity are the
elements lacking.

Mrs. Laura S. Webb, of Toledo, Ohio,
recognizes the change of life as a danger
ous period and she also has faith in Wine
of Cardui. She writes:
"As I had always been troubled more or
less at the menstrual period, I dreaded the
change of life. While visiting with a
friend I noticed that she was taking your
Wine of Cardui and she was so enthu
siastic about it that I decided to try a
bottle. I experienced some relief the first
month so I kept on taking it for three
months and now I menstruate with no
pain and I shall take it off and on now
until I have passed the climax. I do not
doubt that Wine of Cardui will be of great
benefit to many women."

A million suffering women
have found relief in
Wine of Cardui.
