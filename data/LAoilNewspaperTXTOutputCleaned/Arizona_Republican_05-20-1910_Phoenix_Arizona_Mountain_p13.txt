Put into the washing

and scrubbing
To prevent pastry from burning, set
in a pan of water in the oven while
it is baking.
Never try to ice a cake hot and let
a layer cake cool nearly all before
putting together.
Always use lard to grease cake pans,
as salt in butter causes it
to stick to the pans.
A pan of lime set on the shelves
near jellies, fruits and cans will pre
vent their molding.
A small refrigerator, well stocked
with ice, is more useful than a large
one half full.
Sash curtains are preferable to all
others for the kitchen, as they are
easily removed and washed.
Cabbage cut up in shreds and
creamed makes a tasty dish. Serve
in the same way as creamed celery.
Clean japanned trays by rubbing
them over with a little olive oil and
then polishing with a soft cloth.
To clean dirty carved furniture, dip
a fine paint brush in paraffin oil and
paint over the carving with it.
A little vinegar should be rubbed
on hands after they have been in
strong soapy water for any length of
time.
Preserved ginger or a little currant
jelly with tasty crackers passed with
the cup of tea is a happy thought.
White veils dipped into skimmed
milk and pinned upon a sheet will be
as crisp and fresh as new when they
dry.
Oftentimes the burned part of a
cake may be removed by scraping it
with a grater when the cake is quite
cold.
Salts of lemon will remove ink
stains from floors. Use two table
spoonfuls to a quart of water and use
no soap.
Kerosene will polish zinc if it is
rubbed on with a soft cloth until
clean, and then washing the zinc in
boiling water.
A woman who wishes to economize
her strength should not stand while
ironing. Use a stool just the right
height.
The outside of the molasses jug and
of all fruit and jelly jars must be kept
scrupulously clean if insects are to be
kept away.
To destroy flies in a room take half
a teaspoonful of black pepper in powder, one teaspoonful of cream, mix
well together.
A florist says that the leaves of
palms should be washed in milk and
water, which will preserve them and
prevent brown spots.
Sprinkle salt over hot coals and
shake your damp, uncurled ostrich
feathers over the fumes and the ten
drils will curl up smartly.
To remove grease from garments,
dissolve a tablespoonful of salt in four
tablespoonfuls of alcohol, shake well
and apply with a sponge.
If sheets are being worn at the
corners from pinning to the line
strengthen this part of the hem by
stitching several times cross diagonally. Steel knives not in use may be kept
from rusting if they are dipped in a
strong solution of soda, then wiped
dry and wrapped and kept in flannel.
To renovate a fur true rub in a lib
eral quantity of corn meal, let it re
main for several hours, and then
shake and brush out with a good
stiff whisk.
Bunches of asparagus when cooked
should be in the water on end so that
the ends will be above the water. Then
the tops will not be be too soft.
Milk bottles are washed most easily
if filled with cold water immediately
when being emptied. After rinse with
soap suds and then with cold water.
Tomatoes still fed with asparagus
tips and tipped with a generous
amount of mayonnaise dressing makes
delicious salad. Serve on hearts of
lettuce leaves.
Leather in writing cases and blot
ting pads may be sponged with a
weak solution of oxalic acid in warm
water without destroying the delicate
olive tint.
Cut flowers may be preserved for
an unusually long time if a little salt
peter or carbonate of soda is added to
the water. Salt also helps to keep
them fresh.
A delicious salad is made from can
ned cherries and pecan nuts tossed up
with a well-mixed French dressing.
Served on leaves of lettuce hearts it
is as pretty as it is fine.
Bananas mashed to a pulp, sweet
ened with sugar and spread between
thin slices of bread and butter are
very tasty. They make a wholesome
luncheon dessert for the little folks.
If clothes are to be ironed soon
after sprinkling, it is well to use warm
water for sprinkling. Warm water
spreads more quickly than cold, and
the moisture spreads more evenly.
For almond cake filling blanch and
pound fine a pound of shelled al
monds, mix them with two eggs,
cupful of sugar and teaspoonful of
vanilla. Spread between layers and
frost the top.
A salad dressing liked by persons
who appreciate German cookery is
made of thick sour cream, whipped
stiff, and seasoned with vinegar, sugar
and paprika. For a cupful of cream
use a tablespoonful of vinegar.
Swing cotton rags is a fad of the
hour. The colors are carefully selected
and the resultant rugs are astonishingly pretty. The soft pinks, greens
and blues woven with the pure white
are unusually effective.

THE HIGH COST OF LIVING
Increases the price of many necessi
ties without improving the quality.
Foley's Honey and Tar maintains its
high standard of excellence and its
great curative qualities without any
increase in cost. It is the best remedy
for coughs, colds, croup, whooping
cough and all ailments of the throat,
chest and lungs. The genuine is in a

HILDRETH TO REOPEN
IN CRAIG BUILDING
Left Last Night to Purchase a New
Stock of Goods.

The famed
Adams Pharmacy, like the
phoenix bird, has risen from
the ashes. F. Hildreth, the
proprietor of the popular drugstore,
which evaporated in smoke along with
the Adams hotel, was exceedingly hard
hit by the fire; his insurance was rela
tively small. But like the typical
business man of Phoenix, he is 'game.'
He yesterday rented the corner of the
new Craig building on Center and
Monroe streets, immediately north of
the postoffice, and tonight he leaves
for Los Angeles with Mr. Cate, his
manager, to purchase a new stock.
Meanwhile the new store is open for
prescription trade, and within a few
days it will be ready to handle every
branch of the drug business. Mr. Hil
dreth had just purchased one of the
finest soda fountains ever seen in the
city, and fortunately it had not been
installed when the fire came. The new
fountain will be among the appoint
ments of the new store.

HE PREFERRED DEATH
TO LIFE
The Suicide of a Convict in the Yava
pai Jail.

But for a tragedy in the county jail
at Prescott yesterday morning Sheriff
Smith, who arrived in the city yesterday
afternoon would have had a companion
and business that would have taken
him to Florence. He also would have
had come to him a snug sum for mile
age which he has now missed.
The tragedy was the suicide of John
Bryant who had been convicted of
murder in the second degree and was
to be sentenced yesterday morning, the
first thing on the opening of court.
But when Deputy Sheriff George
Heisler went to the cell of Bryant he
found him dead. The old man had
hanged himself with a towel. One end
had been fastened to a bar and the
other about his neck. Then he had
lain down and choked to death.
Bryant had been a resident of
Yavapai county for thirty years and
had been engaged in mining and pros
pecting. On February 4 of this year
he killed S. H. Anderson at Silver
Butte. The men had some trouble
over a trifling financial matter and
Anderson was killed at his cabin with
a shotgun. Bryant claimed that he
had fired in self defense and after An
derson had shot at him with a revolver.

Kidney Remedy will restore your
kidneys and bladder to their normal
state and activity. Sold by Elvey &
