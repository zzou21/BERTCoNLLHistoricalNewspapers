PHOENIX, ARIZONA, MAY 10, 1901.

The newspapers and all who have
watched the course of speculation dur
ing the last four months
are filled with fore-
IMPENDING bodings concerning Wall
CRASH. Street. For more than
three months it has
been predicted that the end could be
far away, though it was admitted that
there were no signs of a break. Spec
ulators were warned by conservative
and experienced men that the market
had reached an extreme danger point.
The warning was nowhere accepted,
though it was known that stocks had
reached fictitious values, which could
not be maintained for an instant after
gigantic combinations in process of
formation were completed. Nobody,
but the gentlemen engaged in the
combinations, could know when these
arrangements might be completed. The
average speculator, however powerful
and far-seeing he might be, occupied a
position as dangerous as the mouth of
a volcano which might become active
at any moment. They have been
cheerfully occupying this dangerous
position ever since, and there has
been a great rush for places beside
them.
It is given out now that these gigan
tic consolidations or "community
of Interests" projects have al
most reached the point of per
fection, after which there will
be no reason for the holding of the
market up any longer. Then there
will be woe and ruin. A gentleman in
Phoenix, who has been in as close
touch as possible with Wall Street, re
ceived a telegram yesterday morning
that there were indications of an early
break; that many believed the crash
would come before night and that
there would be deeper gloom on the
Street than there was on that famous
Black Friday.
Yet this whole matter is one in
which the country at large has no vital
interest. Wall Street has never been
the pulse of the financial condition of the
country. It has on the other hand
curiously happened, though without
cause, that when times were the
worst throughout the country, specu
lation was the most active. We say
without cause, so far as any relation
between the prosperity of the country
at large and the speculators is con
cerned. In hard times, though, when
money is withdrawn from ordinary in
vestment much of it is employed in
speculation.
The crash when it comes will be
more than ordinarily harmless, for it
will affect only those who are ex
tremely rich. Men of ordinary means

Exercise is as bad as too little for the
growing girl. It is very easy for her to
overdo, and this is especially dangerous
at that critical period of a young girl's
life when she crosses the line of woman
hood. It is not an
uncommon thing to
lay the foundation
for years of after
misery by neglect of
necessary precau
tions at the first
"change of life."
The use of Dr.
Pierce's Favorite
Prescription not only
establishes regular
ity, but it gives
health to the entire
womanly organism.
It is the best medi
cine for diseases
peculiar to women
because it cures the
causes of disease
completely and per
manently. "Favorite Prescription"
contains no
alcohol, neither
opium, cocaine nor
any other narcotic.
It cannot disagree
with the most deli
cate constitution.
"For a number of
months I suffered with
female trouble," writes Mrs. Agnes McGowne,
517 Bank Street, Washington, D. C. "I tried
various remedies, but none seemed to do me any
permanent good. The doctors said it was the
worst row of internal trouble they had had. I
decided to write to you for help. I received a
very encouraging reply and commenced treat
ment at once. I had not used your 'Favorite
Prescription' a week before I began to feel
better, and, as I continued, my health gradually
improved, and I am more every day."

the brink of ruin.

There may be a complete answer to
all the counts in the indictment of the
conduct of Christian
MISSIONARY QUESTION.
missions in China,
which have been ac
cumulating for a year.
But the charges cover
too many points. Include so many al
leged specifications under those points
and come from so many respectable
sources that the answer ought to be
made, and made authoritatively,
rather than left to be glanced from
isolated rejoinders covering particular
allegations. Enough of a case has
been made up to demand the attention
of the missionary bodies of this and
other lands. The situation requires of
them an investigation of the work and
personnel of their agents in foreign
parts, and a statement of conditions
that shall take due cognizance of slan
ders, if slanders they be. The subject
must be approached in a spirit differ
ent than that indicated by intimations
of the "low breeding" of critics, or by
sweeping references to "infernal rot,"
or by the ready exchange of such
epithets as "malignant lie" in the dis
putes between Roman Catholic and
Protestant church publications, or even
by the language of the reply to the
famous Buddhist circular by the con
ference of the foreign Protestant mis
sionary societies of the United States
and Canada.
It has been charged against the con
duct of Christian missionaries in
China that they have not shown wis
dom in avoiding inflaming the preju
dices and arousing the fears of the
natives. This charge is preferred,
among others, by Lord Salisbury, Lord
Curzon, Wu Ting Tang, and, inferen
tially, by ex-Minister Denby. It is
charged that in the exercise of extra
territorial jurisdiction they undermine
the authority of the mandarins and
divide villages into hostile camps.
This charge is preferred by Commis
sioner W. W. Rockhill, by Herr von
Brandt, formerly German minister to
Pekin, and by Prof. Isaac Taylor Head
land, of the Methodist University of
Pekin. It is charged that a certain
proportion of the converts they at
tract are worthless or vicious, and in
support of this charge there is a cloud
of witnesses. It is charged that some
of the missionaries have taken part in
looting and have collected indemnities
from villages in excess of their losses.
This charge is preferred by two of the
correspondents with the allied army,
and is endorsed by Sir Robert Hart.
There is still another charge, covering
the whole field of Chinese missions,
and that is that the men conducting
them have not always shaken off the
arrogant spirit of their race when it
meets other races.
These charges come from such
sources that it becomes incumbent upon
missionary organizations to investi
gate them, and if they cannot disprove
them, to enter upon a correction of the
evils complained of.
There is a member of humanity
called the "Welcher." He is one who
repudiates a gambling

debt. He is held in more
lowly esteem than one
who repudiates any
other kind of a debt, for this reason:
The man who obtains a suit of clothes
on his promise to pay, though he may never pay, is presumed to have had a
good intention. If the clothes dealer
had not had such a presumption he
would not have trusted him. There is
no presumption regarding the "wel
cher;" he is in a game and finds him
self without money. His companions
do not know whether he will pay or
not. His future course adds one more
problem to the game already replete
with problems. There is possibly a
more despicable character than the
welcher, who sits in a game whose
rules are already established and with
which he has nothing else to do but
observe them.
But how about the man who estab
lishes his own rules of play and is beaten and then welches. We
understand that this is what the
new democratic council is going
to do in the matter of the
marshal's office. There was a time
when the appointment of the mar
shal's assistants was vested with the
mayor and council, and at one time,

practically with the mayor. It is our
opinion that that was not generally a
good arrangement, but at any rate, it
was changed and the administration of the police
office was turned over to the
marshal. This change was made
not only by a democratic administra
tion, but with the aid of two members
of the council who, it is said, are
now intending to assist in a reversal of
the order of things. They are dis
gusted with their own rules and are
threatening to welch.
An argument advanced yesterday in
favor of this proposed restoration is
this: The council is held responsible
for the good government of the city,
and should therefore have a voice in
the making of appointments. We
will admit that our present police sys
tem is incongruous.
not be elective, but, since it is, and he is elected by the people to be the head of the police system he alone is responsible for the administration of his department, it would be improper for the council to obstruct the discharge of his responsibility. The appointment of assistants, who owe nothing to him, would be a serious obstruction. We hope for the sake of the city that the democratic council will abide by its own rules.
John Rubenstein has been held to
the grand jury for the double murder
at Scottsdale last Monday. The de
fense will probably be insanity. The
Republican has not been commissioned
to pass on his mental condition, but it
is authorized to say that there are
others besides Rubenstein to blame.
For two years it was predicted that
he would kill somebody. It was not
said that he was insane, but he fre
quently threatened the lives of people
against whom he had a grievance.
Those who knew those things of him
and did not cause him to be restrained
are partly responsible for the Scotts
dale murders.
"The tumult and the shouting dies;
the captains and the kings depart;" the
president has gone, the election is
over and all those exciting incidents to
which Phoenix has looked forward
with so great anticipation have passed
away. We have nothing left but a
prospect of a most prosperous summer
which, though elsewhere is regarded as
a dull season, is the one in the Salt River valley which distributes its proceeds of agricultural operations throughout the whole community.

months. Yesterday the ex-senator's
route was along the broad walk in
front of the treasury department,
where, solitary and alone, he walked
slowly up and down, with measured
steps, patiently pushing the baby car
riage which bore his little granddaughter.
Naturally the passersby of the gentler
sex were attracted by the spectacle of
the fond old man and the innocent in
fant. The latter became the center of
an interested group, the leader of which
made the usual overtures.
"What is oo name?" reiterated the
lady again and again.
"Can't oo tell the lady oo name?"
said the long and solemn Kansan in
a hollow voice.
But the granddaughter was obdurate

change of endearing terms, the ex-sen

his daughter's roof-tree. Washington

It is not the home rule party, but the
people of the territory at large who
would be injured by Governor Dole's
resentment exercised in refusal to ex
tend the regular session. The governor
should, one would think, feel anything
but grateful to those who are defending
his reported determination in this re
gard. Their imputation of motives of
political revenge to him in the premises
is anything but complimentary to his
character as the head of the government
of a territory of the United States pos
sessing, by the good will of the national
congress, all the privileges of popular
self-government. Honolulu Republican.
What is the marriage of an American
girl to a little beside that of an Ameri
can young man who secures a wife with
rank and title? The secretary of the
American embassy at London has a
consort who will always be distin
guished because she would be known at
home by the title "Lady." Whether she
will be so addressed in this country if
she comes here to live is a curious ques
tion. Mr. Cutting is to be congratulat
ed on his conquest. American young
men ought to thank him, too. A fair
exchange of brides between countries
does not allow comparisons to the un
advantage of either. Providence (R. I.)
Journal.
I doubt very much if the Europe
which in the sixteenth century could not
unite against the oncoming of the Turks
can unite now in a war against us. But
there are some nations who are coming
under the pressure we are putting upon them, and some time it may lead to
something more than economic competi
tion. They think that we are to shut them out of South America, and that they ought to come in and partition that continent as they have partitioned Africa.
I am no alarmist, but we should be
fools indeed if we shut our eyes to the
importance of these questions. That
which is the danger point is the in
vasion of this hemisphere, the attempt
to set up a European power somewhere
in South America. It seems very re
mote, but the Monroe doctrine is some
thing more than the utterance of a
president: it is the instinct of the
American people that formulated that
doctrine; it is the instinct of self
preservation and self-defense. If South America be open to the competition of the world we will take our
chance with the rest. But it must not
be taken by Europe.
I do not advocate a great army, but,
as I said in the debate on the army bill,
I want to see an army which is the best
organized in the world, no matter how
small it may be. I want to see an army
which, if the time does come, we can
expand with millions of Americans who
are always ready to take up arms for
their country, and I want to see a navy
such as will be adequate to the defense
of the United States.
I do not advocate these for war; I
advocate them for peace. The one
thing that will ensure peace is strength.

the Boston Home Market Club.
By a strange coincidence, James H.
Smith of Shenandoah township, Pa., was
recently united with his brother, Wil
liam Smith, after a separation of thirty-six
years. Each believed the other
dead. After running through the civil
war William went to Kansas. A year
ago, his fortune made, he moved to
Pittsburg. A few days ago he visited
Sharon. Here he saw a young man
driving a team and was struck by his
appearance. He asked him if he knew
anything of James Smith. "Yes," re
plied the young man, "that's my father's name." This led to other inquiries,
and Mr. Smith knew he had found a
nephew. Informed as to where his
brother was living, he went to New
castle, disclosed his identity, and a joyful reunion between the brothers took
place.
Everything is found out sooner or
later. Married men are usually found
out later.
