IN GARDEN WORK
Enrollment in Club Activities
This Year Promises to Be
Large; Some Vegetables
May Be Planted Now-
T. L. Phillips, boys' and girls' club
leader, is busily engaged in visiting the
county school districts for the purpose
of interesting the pupils in club work.
Yesterday forenoon he visited La Cienega
and in the afternoon Ranchos de
Atrisco. County Agent J. D. Tinsley
accompanied him on the latter trip.
Mr. Phillips reported much interest
being taken by the boys and girls, as
well as their parents, in club work,
and the enrollment this year promises to be several times larger than
last year's.
For the benefit of amateur gardeners,
Mr. Phillips gave out a schedule of seeds which may be planted with
reasonable safety at this time.
It is not certain that the season for
frosts is ever, and hardens are by no
means out of danger for three or four
weeks yet. This list includes the hardier varieties of vegetables which are
capable of withstanding considerable
cold weather. It includes:

Early Eruption beets; ox heart
carrots; white silver sun onions;
moss curled parsley; pioneer or
early Alaska peas; hollow crown pars
nips; Strasburg or horned ultra rad
ishes; mammoth sandwich salsify or
oyster plant; long standing spinach;
purple top or white flat Dutch turn
ips for greens; mustard greens and
big Boston or Hanson lettuce.
Peas for city planting are not rec
ommended at all unless they are
protected from the sparrows. These
birds prey upon peas in the city,
where there is not much for them to
eat. Peas may be raised with success
in the country districts where, on ac-
count of plenty of other green stuff to
eat, the sparrows do not make such
heavy inroads on this crop.
Most anything in the vegetable line
can, with proper attention, be raised in
the lowlands, but aside from tomatoes,
beets, cantaloupes, carrots and a few
other thick-grown varieties, it is
recommended that Highland residents
be careful as to the varieties they
plant, unless their garden plots have
been developed to a high state of fer
tility. Those who desire government seeds
free may obtain them by calling at
the office of the county agricultural
agent on the first floor of the Chamber of Commerce.

Soldier Returns to Albuquerque
Still Carrying Countless
Shell Splinters Imbedded in
Left Arm and Side,
Corporal Frank J. Kaiser, who went
overseas to aid in the canning of the
kaiser, is back in Albuquerque, carrying
a number of souvenirs of the war
from a dozen to perhaps a hundred.
He would give them away if he could.
They are tiny splinters from a high
explosive shell which were blown into
his left arm and side at Chateau
Thierry.
The shell put Kaiser out of the rest
of the fighting which followed the his
toric battle of the Yankees at Chateau
Thierry, sending him to a hospital,
where he was confined until almost
the time he was declared fit for re-
crossing the Atlantic. Three large
fragments struck him, tearing large
wounds. These were removed by sur
geons, but it was an impossible task
to remove the smaller splinters no
larger than needle points which
struck Kaiser in a shower.
In time Kaiser will lose all of his
made-in-Germany mementoes of the
war. They are working outward
through the skin gradually. The sol
dier, however, still carries an uncer
tain number of the steel particles. An
X-ray picture, taken by Dr. J. R. Van
Atta, showed the outline of his arm
shot with tiny shadows, made by the
splinters.
Kaiser was a member of the Third
(regular army) division in France,
one of the earliest units overseas, and
wears two gold chevrons on his left
sleeve, showing his long service
abroad. He wears another gold chev
ron on his right sleeve, the army's
recognition of the wounds he received
in action.
Kaiser returned from France on the
battleship Louisiana, landing at New
port News, Va. He was sent to Fort
Bliss, Tex., for discharge and arrived
here Monday. He intends to remain
here for a week and then go to St.
Joseph, Mo., to visit relatives. Kaiser
formerly was foreman at the Albu
querque sanatorium.
The corporal was accompanied on
his homeward voyage by Earl Bow
dich, formerly building inspector here.
He and Bowdich separated in El
Paso, but Bowdich was expected to ar
rive here last night.

CASUALTIES LARGELY
CURRENT DEATHS NOW,
SAYS WAR DEPARTMENT
The casualties of the expeditionary
forces reported so far are 271,277, the
last list issued by the war department
raising the total to that figure.
The number killed in action is 32,
178, including 381 men who lost their
lives at sea. The others are: Died of
wounds, 13,412; died of disease, 22,
321; died from accident and other
causes; 3,980; wounded in action,
194,382; missing in action, not in-
cluding prisoners released and re-
turned, 5,019. More than 80 per cent
of the wounded have returned to duty,
the war department explains.
Major casualties now being reported
from the expeditionary forces consist
largely of current deaths from dis
ease or accident and other causes, ac
cording to Secretary Baker. A few
cases of "killed in action," "died of
wounds," "wounded" and change of
status may be expected from time to
time as posthumous investigations
establish that missing men were in
fact killed, or as the hospital records
are finally searched.
The last list includes no New Mexicans.

ASKS DISTRICT COURT
TO ANNUL ALLEGEDLY
PRETENDED MARRIAGE

The background of the matrimonial
drama of Thomas K. Litch, sometimes known as Thomas E. Kimball,
shifted Monday from Los Angeles to
Albuquerque when Miller & Craig, his
lawyers, began suit in the district
court for annulment of his allegedly
pretended marriage here to Mrs. Man
rine Opal Hendricks.
The complaint asserts the marriage
was pretended, adding that at the
time Justice of the Peace John W.
Wilson pronounced him and Mrs.
Hendricks to be man and wife he was
under legal disability in that he was
a married man. He was married on
July 13, 1910, to Victoria Monnoyer,
he says.
It is alleged that Litch applied for
the license to marry under the name
of Thomas E. Kimball, and the de
fendant's name appears in the com
plaint as Manrine Opal Hendricks,
alias Maurine Opal Kimball. The li
cense was obtained on September 18,
1917.
The plaintiff says he is informed
that the defendant is living in Los
Angeles.
The court is asked to declare the al
legedly pretended marriage null and
void and to free each of the parties to
the suit from any liability.

The city probably will buy a motor
driven street sprinkler, believing that
the purchase will be cheaper than at
tempting to give adequate sprinkling
with the city's horse-drawn tanks.
City Manager Hebenstreit called for
bids yesterday. They are to be sub
mitted by next Tuesday.
The city manager, after making a
careful investigation of motor sprink
lers, urged the commissioners to
make the purchase and they author
ized him to call for bids. According
to his figures the motor can be paid
for in two years with the amount
the city would have to spend for run
ning its horse-drawn sprinklers, and
sprinkle a greater mileage. The us
ual sprinkling appropriation, he said,
not only would pay the cost of the
motor but also operate it for the two
years.
The call for bids did not make any
specifications as to the kind of mo
tor. It was specified, however, that
it must have a 1,200-gallon tank.

Bulk of the Pupils Enthusiastic
for Plan to Teach Them
Practical Ideas Regarding
Hygiene,

The modern health crusade tour-
nament now being conducted in the
city schools by Miss Nellie Hornung, I
school nurse, shows every indication I
of being a success.
Superintendent John Milne, in
speaking of the movement, says "it is
an interesting and effective means of
giving children practical ideas re
garding hygiene and has already
aroused interest among pupils and
parents that will result in improved
physical conditions."
Miss Hornung states that one of
the most encouraging things in con
nection with the crusade is the splen
did cooperation which it is receiving
from the teachers and patrons
throughout the city, and that every
one is beginning to realize that the
other person's child is entitled to good
health as well as his own, and many
are interesting themselves in this
movement for the good of those chil
dren who do not receive these lessons
in personal hygiene at home.
Of approximately one thousand
school children who enrolled in the
crusade, about 80 per cent qualified
as squires. This title is given to those
who at the end of five weeks have
done at least fifty-four out of a pos
sible seventy-two health chores. It
is estimated that at least 75 per cent
will qualify as knights at the end of
ten weeks.
The crusade is being put on here
and in various other parts of the
state by the New Mexico Public
Health association, cooperating with
the Junior Red Cross.
