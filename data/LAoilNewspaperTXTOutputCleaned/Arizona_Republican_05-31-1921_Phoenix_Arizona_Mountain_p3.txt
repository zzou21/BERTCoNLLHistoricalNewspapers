Ex-Army Officer Takes Hotel
With Him Wherever He Goes

After five years of almost incessant
travel over practically every part of
the country, the famous “Fifty-Fifty
Cruiser,” designed by J. Brashears Jr.
of Washington, D.C., a former officer
in the engineer corps with the A.E.F.
in France, is again speeding west on
a journey that will take it around the
United States.

The “Fifty-Fifty,” according to
Brashears, indicates 50 per cent mobility
and 50 per cent comfort and convenience.
The Dodge Brothers car on which he has set
up his big looking craft was bought in
1916. Brashears recently made some
improvements in his “hotelmobile.”
Lately he installed hot and cold water,
bath, etc. and incidentally looked over
the power plant.

“Closer inspection developed three
astonishing facts,” he wrote. “The
pump shaft after running five years
in water, remained absolutely bright
and free from rust; .005 oversize
piston would not go into the cylinders,
and the driving spur and differential
showed no visible wear.” He says he
has frequently averaged 25 miles a
gallon under test and adds that the
moderate priced chain fabric tires on
the car have averaged more than 10,000
miles. “Accurate figures for this
cannot be given because I have never
worn out any tire,” this tourist writes.
“I still have three that are four years
old as spares.”

Brashears and his car have been
the subject of many newspaper and
magazine articles and now he says
the movies are making overtures to
him. His car is built on an economical
plan, he says, and is within reach
of the average car owner who enjoys
a hike about the country.

The machine has a homelike appearance
and a general air of serviceability.
The cruiser body is 5 feet 4 inches
wide and 10 feet long. By using the
front seat as a bed across the full
width of the machine more space
is permitted for cooking purposes.

To get this width the body is extended
8 inches beyond the fenders and running
boards on each side. The headroom
inside is 5 feet. The sides
of the body are covered about 3 feet
high with galvanized iron, 27 gauge,
fastened with bolts wherever it
touches the framing wood, which is
of light, dry oak.

In the rear is a door 30 inches wide
for use while camping when the
front door is blocked into a seat
which is reversed and serves as a
couch. In the rear door is a small
glass window which gives the driver
a view of the road in rear of him.

The seat in the front, which is also
used as a couch, is 26 inches high
and 18 inches wide. When it is
moved forward to the dash and the
back laid flat a bed 44 inches by 6
feet 2 inches is formed.

Under this is a galvanized iron
box 18 inches wide, 14 inches deep
and the full length of the seat, used
for storage and protection of clothing.
Leading from the front seat to
the rear door is a clear floor space
7 feet long and 2 feet wide. On
the left side is a trunk 3½ feet long
by 20 inches wide and a table covered
with oilcloth to carry clothes and also
to serve as a kitchen table.
Directly back of this is a two burner
gasoline stove connected directly with
the main gasoline tank, which is of
the air pressure type, holding 15 gallons,
which provides fuel for both the
stove and the motor of the car.

Opposite the stove is the washstand,
30 by 20 inches, with a large
space under it for bulky but lightweight
cooking utensils, etc. On the
right side, just opposite the clothing
trunk and of similar size, is another
trunk partitioned to carry two extra
tires and ample space to carry provisions
for two weeks.

Under the main floor forward is
a sawdust-insulated box capable of
holding 50 pounds of ice and provided
with a drawpipe through the bottom.
The cruiser is equipped with electric
lights, a fireless cooker, books
and a clock. It is a snug little home,
which eliminates even the necessity
of searching for camp grounds, to
say nothing of hotels.

STILL NOT YET DECIDED
BY BOARD

Whether Michan Martin will be
hanged on June 10 for the murder of
Arthur De Steunder, Canadian soldier,
has not been decided by the
board of pardons and paroles. The
matter was left open after being
given consideration at a two days’
meeting of the board following a
preliminary session on Friday afternoon.

Attorney General W. J. Galbraith
declared yesterday that what had
been brought out up to the present
time was not in Martin’s favor. Dr.
A. M. Tuthill, commander of the
Frank Luke Post of the American
Legion, is one of the foremost workers
in the attempt to have the death
sentence commuted to life imprisonment.
Representatives of the American
Legion post at Florence also appeared
in behalf of Martin while he
was represented by counsel. Interest
of certain members of the legion
here and in Florence is based on the
fact that Martin was in the army.
De Steunder also served his country
overseas, fighting with the allies for
many months.

Sheriff Davis of Yavapai County
and others gave information to the
board not brought out during the
course of the trial which strengthened
the case against him. More details
of the quarreling of De Steunder and
Martin were outlined to the board
than are contained in the transcript
of evidence to which close attention
has been given for many weeks.

It was shown that Martin and De
Steunder quarreled frequently over
money matters on their motor tour
across country. That Martin promised
to assign his car to De Steunder
for a debt when they reached Holbrook
was testified to before the
board. It also was brought out that
on one occasion De Steunder took a
gun from Martin who was arrested in
California shortly after the Canadian
soldier’s body was found near Kingman,
where he was last seen with
Martin.

All this and more was called to the
attention of the board at the meeting
in Florence which extended over Saturday
and Sunday, the members—Mr.
Galbraith, the attorney general; Elsie
Toles, state superintendent of public
instruction, and J. O. Sexson, the
citizen member—reaching Phoenix at
1 o’clock yesterday morning.

An eight-hour day was not observed
during the sessions which lasted
a full 10 hours daily. In addition to
considering cases, the board visited
the penitentiary and attended a motion
picture show at the prison
which was filmed in and around the
penitentiary. The prisoners were
present when the film was shown and
were an orderly lot, according to Mr.
Galbraith.

Seventy-two cases for paroles and
commutation of sentence were considered,
and of the number, Wong
Tong of Fairbanks, convicted of manslaughter;
Frank Ford of Bisbee, a
bigamist, and Manuel Ochoa of Tucson
will be recommended for parole.

The expiration of their minimum
sentences having expired, 17 will be
recommended for parole because of
good behavior, and Dr. E. F. Campbell
will be recommended for pardon,
conditional that he leave the state.
Dr. Campbell was convicted in this
county of an attempt to commit murder
and given from one to three years.

The parole of R. T. Scott was revoked.
The Cochise county convict,
who was paroled on expiration of his
minimum sentence and who had an
excellent good conduct record while
in prison, committed another crime
while at liberty. The parole of Joel
Smith of this county also was revoked.

In discussing the meeting Mr. Galbraith
said it was satisfactory in that
every man who had anything to say
appeared before the board. This was
one of the first rulings made by Mr.
Galbraith when he became a member
by his election as attorney general.

“We want the men to stand on
their own feet and present their cases
in their own way. Every one of the
72 whose cases we considered were
given the opportunity to come before
us and to know that the matter so
vital to them had reached the board.”

The next meeting of the board will
be held the end of June, Mr. Galbraith
said. Anything further in the Martin
matter will be handled at a special
meeting held in Phoenix.

LITHOGRAPHIC STONE
IS FOUND IN ARIZONA

America’s first deposit of lithographic
stone was recently discovered
near Sycamore, 20 miles south of
Mayer, according to word received
here. Until this time Germany has
furnished the world’s supply of this
mineral.

Henry C. Heffelman, a merchant of
Mayer, and George Scholey, a miner
also of Mayer, made the important
discovery. They report that at the
same location marble and tufa is
found.

Lithographic stone is a yellowish,
fine-grained slaty limestone used in
lithography. Both marble and tufa
are used extensively in ornamenting
buildings.

Necessary location work is now being
done and the property has been
bonded to a group of investors from
El Paso. Extraction of the valuable
deposits will probably begin some
time in July.

RECITAL PLEASES
LARGE AUDIENCE

MOTHER
PAUPERS’ GRAVES
WERE FORGOTTEN

There were no flowers or flags to
decorate the little plots of ground in
abandoned Odd Fellows cemetery
which marks the pauper’s last resting
place yesterday. Phoenicians, in their
plans to tribute soldiers dead, overlooked
the barren graves of forgotten
men and women.

It is not often that Phoenix forgets
its “forgotten” dead. The pauper’s
grave, ordinarily, feels the touch of
human kindness on Decoration Day.
Some local organization, civic or benevolent,
has, in years gone by, taken
upon its shoulders the task of decorating
these graves. But yesterday
was an exception.

The oversight was due to thoughtlessness,
or rather to haste in drafting
of a program for the Decoration
Day ceremonies, it was explained.
