CALENDAR OF EVENTS

Recital at the Arizona School of
Music Saturday afternoon at 3:30 by
pupils of the piano, violin and ex-
pression departments. This program
is open to the public without charge.
Everyone cordially invited.

CHRISTIAN REVIVAL

There will be services this evening at
the Christian church, the rest night
for the revival being Monday. Evan-
gelist Carter will sing "The Cross."
Evangelist Harnett will preach on "The
Message of the Three Crosses."
The evangelist took for his theme
last night the parable of the vineyard
as recorded in Matt. 20. Some of the
lessons he drew from this passage were
briefly as follows: "God has a world to
save. This world was made by God
and belongs to Him. Some folks seem
to think it belongs to the devil. But
this is not true. The only part he
possesses is what he has stolen. God
wishes to save this world and calls on
laborers to His vineyard to gather the
valuable fruit. He has called men in
all ages and is calling them today.
He wants workers, not idlers.
Too
many respond to the invitation to "go
work in my vineyard," but after get-
ting in, sit comfortably down in the
shade while the other fellow does the
work. He called men in various ways
in ancient times, but now, according to
Paul, He calls you by His gospel. All
the men of the parable answered the
first call. Your eleventh hour has
come and passed. When the call comes
you must answer that call now."

STORE RECITAL
Ivas Skougaard, the popular bari-
tone of the Arizona School of Music,
is to be the soloist at the store re-
cital to be given by the Redewill
Music company next Monday even-
ing. Skougaard has a rich, full
voice and is very popular here. Due
to the limited space at Redewill's, it
has been found necessary to reserve
the seats for the entertainment.

DINNER ENGAGEMENT General
and Mrs. A. J. Sampson yesterday
received a telegram from former
United States Senator Burton of
Ohio, that on his arrival in Phoenix
next Friday he will take dinner with
them. General and Mrs. Sampson
are old friends of the senator. The
general has known him since he was
a young man and Mrs. Sampson's
acquaintance with him dates back
still further. When he was a little
boy and she was a little girl they
were schoolmates in a little red
school house in Ohio.

WITNESSES BEGIN

GANDY TELL ABOUT
L
County Attorney Means to Press the
Charges; Hearings Begin Monday;
Ohlsen Hearings This Morning
County Attorney Clyde M. Gandy
meant business when he said that he
would begin an early investigation and
prosecution of the cases of alleged
false registration for the city election.
More than half a dozen witnesses
were examined by him yesterday. Practically the entire day
was given over to investigating the
registrations, who if anyone is involved, Mr. Gandy
remains mum on.

The preliminary hearing of J. P.
Hannan, charged with illegally regis-
tering Savanah Robinson, which was
scheduled for yesterday, was continued
until Tuesday afternoon at two o'clock.
The preliminary hearing of K. C.
Ohlsen, who is charged with perjury,
which was set for Thursday, was con-
tinued until ten o'clock this morning.
Ohlsen is alleged to have sworn to
false affidavits. Both hearings will be
held in Justice De Souza's court.

COYOTE PACK LOSES
Miss Hazel Schoonmaker Goes to
El Paso to Become Bride of
A. V. Hughes.
H. S. has lost a very prominent
member of the high school faculty.
Miss Hazel Schoonmaker, who has
been at the head of the Spanish de-
partment for three years, left last
night on the 7:30 train for El Paso,
where she is to be married to Mr.
A. Virgil Hughes at 11 o'clock this morning in the Episcopal church.
Mr. Hughes is a well-known business man of El Paso. With pangs of regret that the Coyote
pack is parting with Miss Schoon-
maker, the students wish her the best
of happiness. This is indeed a great
surprise to her many friends. Her
home is in Tucson. She is a grad-
uate of the University of Arizona.
Mr. Cook said last night that no
other teacher would take her place,
as it has been arranged to give Mrs.
Ingles English classes to Miss Stanley
and let Mrs. Ingles take charge of the
Spanish department for the rest of the
year.
Mrs. Hughes will go back east on
their honeymoon, where they will
visit Mr. Hughes' relatives.

merly local manager for the Fisk
Rubber company's factory branch in

EDWARDS SUIT Mrs. H. G. Ed-
wards will not be allowed attorney's
fees of $500 nor $75 a month alimony
during the pendency of her divorce
suit against the man who is serving
an indeterminate sentence in Florence.
This was the ruling of Judge Stanford
of the superior court, who bases his
decision on the fact that the Edwards
property has been assigned. Judge
Stanford stated that where an assign-
ment has been made the wife has no
right to funds of the estate.
