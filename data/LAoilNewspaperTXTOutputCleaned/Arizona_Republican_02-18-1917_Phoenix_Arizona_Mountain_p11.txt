FOR SATURDAY
There were four divisions of the superior
court of Maricopa county yesterday.
Judge Stanford of division one
and Judge Turtle Lymn of division two were
on the bench throughout the day while
Judge Sidney Spahn of Navajo and
Judge Frank O. Smith of Yavapai
counties also sat in cases of local im
portance. Owing to the large amount of work
which has been accumulating since the
beginning of the Hunt-Campbell con
test case, Judge Stanford sat in some
half dozen of these cases yesterday,
continuing the contest until Monday
morning.

NEW YORK, Feb. 17. (Wall
Street) All branches of the stock
list reflected further confidence dur
ing today's brief period of trading,
dealings being on a larger and broad
er scale than any previous day of
the week. Under the lead of United
States Steel, industrials rose 1 to 4
points, marked strength being mani
fested by Lackawanna Steel and Re
public Iron. Coppers and equipments
advanced as much, the entire metal
group being materially strengthened
by unconfirmed reports of the sale

of a moderate amount of "spot" cop
per at the unprecedented price of 37
cents per pound.
Shippings were the most active
features next to steel and iron shares
at average gains of 2 points, their
rise being accompanied by a decline
in marine insurance rates.
Among the few exceptions to the
general advance were American Beet
Sugar and American Snuff, the latter
falling 12 points after gaining seven
the day before. Final prices were
slightly under top levels, but the
closing was active and strong. Total
sales, 273,000 shares.
Trading in bonds was light with
an irregular tone, except in interna
tionals, which showed slight improve
ment. Total sales, par value, $1,700,
000. United States coupon 3's advanced
½ point and registered 4's lost a
point on call during the week.
WEEKLY FINANCIAL STATEMENT
NEW YORK, Feb. 17. Further un
certainties in the international sit
uation which resulted in a general
freight blockade were among the
more adverse features of a dull week
in the stock market.
It was evident, however, in the
very moderate daily operations that
market or technical conditions were
sound, even though indications of
further liquidations were not alto
gether lacking. Much private and
corporation capital is awaiting the
outcome of events at Washington,
where preparations for a large gov
ernment issue are assumed to be
well towards completion. Also it is
understood that our bankers have
arranged the preliminaries for sev
eral additional foreign flotations,
these to partake of renewals of loans
to South America and additional
credits to France.
In the stock market representative
industrials were again stronger than
rails. Shares of the various war
supply concerns scored irregular ad
vances, partly as a result of the pub
lication of favorable statements of
earnings and because of the likeli
hood of contracts going to home gov
ernment.
All the metal markets were stimu
lated by advances in raw and refined
products, such as copper for instance,
being quoted at the record price of
37 cents a pound, although it is not
known that actual sales were made at
that figure.
Shipping shares made considerable
improvement later in the week, their
rise being coincident with a fall in
marine insurance rates. Issues of
related companies strengthened in
sympathy.

CHICAGO GRAIN
CHICAGO, Feb. 17 Many com
plaints that abnormally dry weather
in the southwest and west was causing
serious crop damage gave an upward
slant to wheat today. The market
closed unsettled at the same as yester
day's finish to 1¼ higher, with May
$1.73 to $1.73¼ and July $1.48¼ to
$1.49. Corn wound up unchanged to
½ cent higher, oats gained 1½ cents to ½ cent,
and provisions showed a rise of 10 to
20 cents.
Notwithstanding a good deal of inde
cision at the outset, bulls in wheat
soon obtained an evident advantage
from messages that flooded in, telling
of poor crop prospects throughout a
large portion of the winter wheat belt,
especially Kansas and sections of Mis
souri. There were predictions of a
fair sized decrease in the United
States visible supply total on Monday.
Disappointment over the absence of
any new export buying led to some re
action in wheat prices as the day ap
proached an end. New crop months,
however, maintained a relatively firm
tone.
Some inquiry from the seaboard
made the corn market harden a trifle.
Oats reflected the changes in corn
values.
Higher quotations on hogs brought
about a firmness in provisions. The
bulls though led to considerable re
lizing on the part of holders.

Close: Wheat: May $1.73¼; July
$1.48¼.
Corn: May $1.01; July 99½c.
Oats: May 56c; July 54c.

GREAT VERDE EXTENSION

LOWEST PRICED

Have you examined the map of the Jerome District? Have you noticed
the location of the GREAT VERDE EXTENSION property?
If not, look at your map now. The surrounding properties are developing
as fast as money and men can do the work.
Directly to the west, a few hundred feet, Dundee-Arizona has the ore
in the shaft and a great body of FOUR to SIX per cent, ore on the surface,
a steam shovel deposit.
Experts say this deposit is plainly traceable on the surface, through the
intervening ground of the UNITED VERDE EXTENSION, into the GREAT
VERDE EXTENSION.
To the south, scarcely farther away, on the GADSDEN property (Calumet
& Arizona interests), eighty men are at work, installing machinery and
sinking a three-compartment shaft to a thousand-foot depth.
Closer still is the Jerome-DEL MONTE (Former Gov. Tasker L. Oddie
and associates) backed by ample capital, ready to commence development
on a similar scale.
The work on these three properties alone, regardless of what is being done
to the north by the JEROME SUPERIOR has undoubtedly materially
increased the value of GREAT VERDE EXTENSION in the past few weeks.
Nevertheless, we are going through with our original plan of providing a
strong fund for financing the sale of Treasury Stock by selling 200,000
shares of our personal stock at the agreed upon price of FIFTEEN CENTS
a share.
These shares are full-paid and non-assessable, and deposited in escrow,
subject to the requirements of the ARIZONA CORPORATION (Blue-Sky)
COMMISSION. The par value is TWENTY-FIVE CENTS a share.
W. Paul Geary, who retired from that Commission January 1st, is Presi
dent of GREAT VERDE EXTENSION COPPER COMPANY.

OF LOCATION

O. S. Wakeling of the ARIZONA MINE SUPPLY CO., is Treasurer, and
W. B. Yorick, E. M. an experienced mine manager, is Secretary.
Melvin E. Frasier, former Chief Counsel of the TITLE INSURANCE &
TRUST COMPANY of LOS ANGELES, and President of the JEROME
SUPERIOR COPPER COMPANY, is the fourth member of the Board of
Directors.

The standing and ability of these gentlemen is a moral guarantee to in
vestors in the shares of GREAT VERDE EXTENSION of a competent,
efficient and economical management.

There are 1,500,000 shares in the Treasury, none of which has yet been
offered for sale. When offered, the opening price will not be less than
THIRTY CENTS probably FIFTY CENTS a share.
Those happy now over stocks bought not more than two years ago in the
Jerome District at a few cents a share, are the ones who were smiled at
then. It is a clear case now of having the laugh on their side.
Here is a real chance of repeating their experience by buying these shares
at FIFTEEN CENTS.
Of the 200,000 shares, set aside by us out of our own holdings, to provide a
strong fund to be spent in selling the TREASURY stock, a good portion
has been sold.
GREAT VERDE EXTENSION COPPER COMPANY has no debts, owns
its property free of any encumbrance, paid cash for it, and now is the time
to buy its shares.
Make your remittances payable to the BANK OF JEROME. Because of
the limited amount of shares remaining unsold of this special offering, we
must reserve the right to reject or scale down any and all subscriptions.

This was noticeable by the recovery
in Northwestern, St. Paul preferred
and Anglo-French bonds.
There are plenty other bargains on
the list, but they have to meet the com
petition of the foreign loans.
It is likely the government will make
a considerable bond issue, and there
will be further French and English of
ferings. With copper selling around 37 cents
and silver around 79 cents, there is not
likely to be much liquidation.
One is inclined to do much at this
time.
Chesapeake & Ohio published a
statement for the year which shows a
surplus of $1,665,882, representing more

NEW YORK, Feb. 17. The great
strength of the market's position, the
strongest position beyond any question
in recent Wall Street history, began to
show more positively yesterday. On
the previous days the shorts had been
allowed to offer down prices where
they could, without much interference.
This result was that the bears them
selves discovered that it was one thing
to get quotations off a point or so and
quite another thing to bring out a sup
ply of stocks for covering purposes.

These speculative operations had no
other result than to increase an already
large and a very weak short account.
As a last resort, the bear party tried to
