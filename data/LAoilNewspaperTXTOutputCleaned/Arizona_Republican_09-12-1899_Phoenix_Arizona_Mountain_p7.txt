Mines and Mining

"THE OLD DOMINION."
Rapid Development of This Great
Property During the Year.
The Old Dominion Copper Mining
and Smelting company, operating the
oldest and most important mines in
the district, has made very material
progress during the past few months
in the development of the mine, and
especially in the betterment of the
plant and in surface improvements.
The heavy flow of water in the mine
retarded development during the early
part of the present year, but that ob-
stacle has been overcome by installing
a Nordberg-Corliss pump, of capacity
of 500 gallons per minute raised 1,000
feet, which enabled the opening of
new ground below the tenth level, and
sinking the shaft has been resumed
from what was the extreme depth
850 feet from the surface, and 825
feet below the twelfth level within
the past week. Superintendent Parnell
informs us, says the Globe Silver Belt,
that before driving the twelfth level
the shaft will be sunk 100 feet fur-
ther. Two bailing tanks are to be at-
tached to the hoist, each of 1,000 gal-
lons capacity, to be used should any
difficulty with the pump arise. It is
expected that it will be possible with
the bailing tanks to handle nearly
1,000 gallons of water per minute,
whereas the pump raises 500 gallons
per minute.
The mine is furnishing sufficient ore
to supply the smelter, and in addition
a large reserve stock pile of ore has
been accumulated at the smelter to
provide against any serious accident
that might happen at the mine.
The most important addition made
to the plant is the new 20x60 double
reel, flat rope, first-motion hoist, the
installation of which was a work of
some magnitude, as it is a ponderous
machine, the largest in the territory,
and capable of sinking 2,000 feet. The
new hoist has been running one cage
since last Sunday, and is very satis-
factory. The yards and buildings
about the shaft present a very orderly
and business-like appearance. The
buildings are all well constructed and
equipped with the very best modern
machinery for efficient work.
Among the new additions noted are
sheds extending from the carpenter
shop, over the framing machine and
saw mill, and new buildings for the
foundry and blacksmith shop. New
roads and yard arrangements put the
surface plant in convenient and pre-
sentable shape.
At the smelter some time since No.
1 furnace was moved to the front of
the building and top jackets and a
large cast iron water jacket settler
were put in, all of which have been
very successful. One large rectangular
furnace is in blast and is making a
large output of copper. The slag dump
is a very good indication of the smelt-
ing operations, and that is growing at
an enormous rate. A new 23x30 Nord-
berg-Corliss engine and a No. 7 Con-
nersville blower were installed last
spring and are doing excellent work.
The company is doing no work on
the Continental (recently acquired and
situated eighteen miles west of Globe)
pending the completion of surveys and
construction of a passable wagon
road to the property.

MINING NOTES.

George Truman and Lou Gilson re-
turned Tuesday from their mines south
of Casa Grande, says the Florence
Tribune. They brought back with
them some very rich specimens of
copper ore from an immense ledge,
which promises to become a world
beater. They are very enthusiastic
over their find, and the Tribune hopes
their fondest expectations may be
realized.
The Pioneer mining company, about
ten miles east of Florence, is one of
the most promising sections in the
territory. A few years ago consider-
able work was done there in mining
for silver, says the Florence Tribune,
but since that much despised metal
has become a drug on the market on
account of unfavorable legislation
many of the claims were abandoned.
It is only recently that attention has
been directed to the fine showing of
copper, and when such thorough min-
ing men as H. B. Ailman and George
B. Chittenden put up their money on
the proposition it is safe to say there
is something worth mentioning in the
district. Mr. Ailman paid $2000 for
some claims just north of the canal
head gate, which he is now developing,
and on which there is a splendid show-
ing of high grade copper ore. This
week Mr. Chittenden bought four ad-
joining claims from Messrs. Stone,
McGee and Harris for $5,000 cash. The
same mineral belt crosses the river,
and the surface showing is fully as
good on the south side. From the
present outlook Florence is promised
a flourishing mining camp at its very
door.
A letter to Dr. W. W. Lewis from
Jake Carmichael, dated New York,
September 4, says: “We reached here to-
day; will ship the 6th for South
America, will write you from Pana-
ma.
We were royally entertained by
Mr. C. P. Collins and associates in
Bradford, Pa., where we spent one day.
All of us are in good health and excel-
lent spirits. One of the company goes
with us to Peru.” Prescott Courier.
A San Francisco dispatch says a
deal has been closed by which twenty-
seven mining companies owning prop-
erties in Nevada, all embraced in what
is known as the Comstock group, have
contracted for electrical power, and it
is believed that quite a number of
mines which for years have found it
impossible to work low grade ores on
account of the excessive cost of power,
will now take on a new lease of life
and handle with profit the ore which
has heretofore been cast aside as
worthless.
More mining failures have resulted
from crosscut tunnels intended to tap
the vein than by all other plans com-
bined. Until a mine’s development is
sufficient to show to a certainty that
a sufficient ore body is in sight to
justify the driving of a tunnel it is an
unsafe proposition. The best rule for
beginners is the oft repeated one, “fol-
low the ore.” A prospecting tunnel is
a delusion and a snare.—Denver Min-
ing Reporter.
The Ruby King Mining company
(Twillinger, Goss & Dailey) own two
claims on Pinal mountain, near the
Breman saw mill site, on which they
have opened three feet of sulphide ore
assaying 24 to 30 per cent in copper,
and also carrying values in gold and
silver, says the Globe Silver Belt.
Dave Heron and William Whalley
last Saturday visited their copper
claim, the Moonlight, six miles south-
west of Globe, says the Belt. They
have an immense ledge on the surface
and are sinking a shaft which is now
down thirty-five feet and will be con-
tinued to the depth of sixty feet, hop-
ing to find ore of higher grade at that
depth.
In a new shaft which was recently
started on the Little Buck mine at a
depth of ten feet a fine body of galena
ore was encountered. This ore is the
same as found in other shafts on the
mine, but the vein is much wider at
the new strike, which at present is
four feet wide. Work on the Presi-
dent mine shows an improvement in
ore with depth.—Bulletin.

POOR CARE OF LIBERTY STATUE.
Weak Lighting and Neglected Grounds
Complaints of Visitors.

The grounds about the Statue of Lib-
erty on Bedloe’s Island are in sorry
condition, the grass left to grow wild,
the steps and outstanding approaches
weather worn and uncared for. A fru-
gality recalling the thrift of the early
Dutch settlers is conspicuous in the
mode of lighting the big stairway, and
the entire place, at this, one’s show
time of the year, when mere holiday
sightseers, who determined before they
left home that a trip to the great
statue out in the harbor was one of
the things not to be missed on their
New York visit. Some of them buy 50
cent effigies of the statue in glass and
metal on the boat before they ever get
there, and before leaving the island
search the ground over for a bit of
the granite the base is made of, or
some other souvenir of the place to
take away with them.
“I’m a good climber when there’s
light to see by,” said a middle aged
woman yesterday, as her tourist party
paused on the third landing, in the
ascent to the statue, “but my, those
weak little lanterns! They would hard-
ly give light in a pantry closet, and
not half enough of them, and just set
down on the floor at that! You girls
can feel your way up further, if you
want to, but I’ll go here by the door
and wait for you.”
“Why, those little hand lanterns on
the landings are no better than a
farmer uses to light the way to his
cow shed,” said a man who had tried
ineffectually to induce his wife to
make the ascent. “I don't believe
they burn 10 cents’ worth of coal oil
here a week. They have only got
lights on every other landing.”
“And the lanterns don’t smell pleas-
ant,” said his wife, with a housekeep-
er’s observation. “The glass shades
haven’t been washed or the wicks
trimmed in a month of Sundays.”
It is said that the use of the statue
as a sightseer’s Mecca and as a
money making enterprise is leased by
the government to three of New York’s
citizens, who conduct the matter as
suits them best, perhaps with but nat-
ural regard for their selfish interests.
It is a limited schedule that is run by
the boat, and occasionally a visitor of
an observing turn of mind is heard to
remark that he can go all the way to
Coney Island and back in a fine big
boat for what it costs to make the
short trip to the Liberty Statue in an
out-of-date, dingy old tub that looks
risky, and is cramped in accommoda-
tion.—New York Post.

ANY ONE CAN DO THAT.
“Well,” said the old gentleman to
his son, “you have failed in every line
of business I have set you up in. Is
there anything you think you can do?”
“Oh, yes,” replied the boy carelessly.
“I could probably write a play.”—Chi-
cago Post.

NOT AN AVAILABLE SUBSTITUTE.
Hon. Champ Clark is engaged in
sprinkling his views throughout the
west. Champ possesses considerable
lung power but it will not be sufficient
to make up for the deficit in harvest
hands.—Washington Post.
