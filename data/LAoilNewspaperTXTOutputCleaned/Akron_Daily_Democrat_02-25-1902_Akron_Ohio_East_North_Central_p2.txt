CHEERS FOR PRESIDENT
AND FOR THE PRINCE,
(Continued from first page.)
The party took lunch with the German
Ambassador and the members of his
staff. The party at the table numbered 22. Prince Henry occupied the
seat of honor with Dr. Von Holleben
sitting opposite.
The entire first floor of the embassy
had been placed at the disposal of the
Prince and his personal staff. Prince Henry had as his private study
the Japanese room, with its rich oriental furnishings and curios, even the
walls showing the characteristic Japanese storks. The Ambassador of
Japan also was at his disposal when occasion required.
The main body of the Prince's staff,
after the call at the White House
proceeded to the New Willard hotel,
where quarters covering the entire
first floor were at their disposal.
Tremendous cheering from the
crowds announced the coming of Pres-
ident Roosevelt to the embassy to return the call of Prince Henry. The
President drove in an open landau
with Colonel Bingham his naval
aid; Commander Cowles following in
a carriage. The cheering was continuous as the President drove along, and
he held his silk hat off his head much
of the time in recognition of the re-
ceived demonstrations.
As the President stepped out of the
carriage the German Ambassador was
at the threshold to greet him. There
was a momentary exchange of greet-
ing, and then the President passed up
the stairway to the drawing room,
where Prince Henry was awaiting his
coming. The Prince stepped forward
and greeted the President most cordially. The President and Prince re-
mained together for about ten min-
utes, being left alone at first and
later being joined by the Ambassador,
when their personal greetings were
completed. There was no exchange
of formal addresses during the visit,
which was strictly one of official and
informal courtesy, although it gave opportunity for expressions of mutual cordiality
and good will between the two na-
tions. Following the call of the President
came that of the Commissioner of the
District of Columbia, who called to
extend the Prince the welcome of the
city of Washington. The Prince
received them in the drawing room
where President H. H. McFarland, of
the commission, delivered an
address of welcome. Prince Henry
acknowledged the address with all ex-
pression of earnest thanks. He spoke
in English, and referred to the pleasure with which he had long looked
forward to coming to America.

VISITED CONGRESS.
House and Senate Warmly Wel-
comed Prince Henry.
Washington, Feb. 25.—Flanked on
either side by a bicycle platoon of
police, Prince Henry, escorted by a
troop of cavalry, arrived at the cap-
itol at 11 o'clock, to see how Congress
works.
Prince Henry no longer wore the
brilliant uniform and illuminated chapeau
in which he had appeared earlier in
the day. He was attired in the simple
dark blue stag uniform of Ger-
man admiral, and wore the flat Her-
man naval cap of his rank. The mem-
bers of his suite wore fatigue uni-
form, and the German Ambassador
had exchanged his court dress for a
conventional frock suit. In the matter
of gold lace and braid, General Cor-
bin and Admiral Evans, still in the
splendor of full dress uniforms, far
outshone the Prince and his staff.
The party was met at the great
bronze doors leading into the rotunda
by a committee from the House, con-
sisting of Mr. Hill, of Illinois; Mr.
Dismukes, of Arkansas, and General
Crosby, of Ohio, chairman of the
committee having the arrangements
for the reception in charge. Brief
cordial greetings having been ex-
changed, the Prince and his party,
under the protection of a half hundred
police, were conveyed through solid
walls of people packed in the rotunda
and statuary hall to the room of
Speaker Henderson, in the rear of the
House lobby. Here the Speaker, who
was awaiting him, greeted the Prince
with a warm handshake as Mr. Hill
presented "His Royal Highness."
General Henderson invited the Prince
to be seated, while the German Am-
bassador made the other introductions,
and then in a few words formally wel-
comed him.
The Prince thanked the Speaker for
his courtesy and without further cere-
mony the party proceeded to the gal-
lery of the House, walking up the mar-
ble stairs instead of using the elevator. An impressive sight met the gaze
of the Prince as he reached the thresh-
old. The surrounding galleries were
crowded to the doors and below on
the floor in the long concentric circles
of the well hall the members were at
their desks.
The Prince's appearance at the door
of the gallery caused an enthusiastic
demonstration. No sooner had his
tall, graceful figure been framed in
the doorway when a spontaneous out-
burst of applause swept floor and gal-
lery. The Prince paused, smiled through
his blonde beard, and acknowledged
the greetings with a slight bow. Then
advancing with the German Ambas-
sador and Mr. Hill on either side, he
descended to his place reserved for
him in the front row of the gallery.
Instantly every eye was upon him.
He seemed perfectly oblivious of the
fact that he was on exhibition at close
range.
Mr. Gilbert, of Kentucky, was ad-
dressing the House at the time on the
Philippine questions, although the dip-
lomatic and consular appropriation bill
was under consideration. Prince
Henry seemed interested, listening at-
tentively for several minutes to what
Mr. Gilbert had to say, and appearing
much pleased at the hearty applause
which followed the statement of the
Kentucky member that the Anglo
Saxon and German races are one.
The party remained about ten min-
utes in the gallery, and then descend-
ed to the Ways and Means committee
room, where a reception was to be
held. The demonstration as the Prince
left the gallery was prolonged.
In the committee rooms the members
formed in line, and were presented by
Mr. Hill. The members of the Prince's
suite were arranged in a semi-circle
behind them, but owing to the limited
time were not presented to the mem-
bers of the House. Practically the
entire membership of the House took
advantage of the chance to meet
Prince Henry, the Democrats being
seemingly quite as anxious to enjoy
the honor as the Republicans. Sev-
eral of the members had their chil-
dren with them, and one or two were
accompanied by their wives. Mr.
Graham, of Pennsylvania, was the
first to shake hands with the Prince,
who gave each member in turn a smile
and a word of friendly cordiality and
a firm grasp of the hand. Mr. Wil-
liams, of Mississippi, and Mr. Wanch-
ter of Maryland, exchanged a few
remarks with the Prince in German.
The Prince next visited the Senate,
where he was received with great
applause. A debate was just over,
and it was the intention of the Senate
to give the Prince an informal reception such as he received at the House
end of the Capitol, but in the excitement attending the proceedings on the
floor the arrangement was not car-
ried out.
The Prince departed through the
main door, the Senators remaining on
their feet until he had disappeared.
He was then joined by his suite and
repaired to the east door, where the
carriages were in waiting.
THE DINNER.
One of the Most Elaborate Washington Has Ever Seen.
Washington, Feb. 25.—The din-
ner given to Prince Henry by President
Roosevelt at the White House last
night closed the honors bestowed on
the royal visitor by official Washing-
ton society. The affair was on an elab-
orate scale and brought together a
most distinguished company.
To accommodate the 110 or
guests the dinner table was set in
the state room, the decorations of
which were on the most magnificent
scale ever attempted. An effective
and new feature was the electric light
illumination. Several thousand little
electric lights of all colors and ar-
ranged in fanciful designs supplemented
the illumination from the great
chandeliers. They were hung in artis-
tic shapes from the tops of the large
mirrors and gracefully intertwined on
the smilax with which they were
covered. A square canopy of them was
hung over the center of the room di-
rectly over the places occupied by the
President and the guest of honor.
The general effect of the decorations
in the dining room was pink and
white. This was especially characteristic of the immense table, which was
formed in the shape of a crescent with
the concave side toward the east,
where President Roosevelt had his
seat.
Large plats of pink and white pri-
mroses in beds of ferns were placed at
short spaces and between them were
hung crystal vases with bunches of red
and white roses. Pink-shaded candel-
abra completed the decorations of the
tables. On some of the mantels there
were huge banks of pink and white
lilies with beds of ferns and other
greens, and on others there was a
profusion of many colored crotons:
while from the ceiling hung folds of
silk and from the chandeliers were
festooned strings of the same material,
plunged between clusters of electric
bulbs. Behind the seats occupied by
the President and the royal visitor
were draped from the top of the win-
dow the German and American flags.
Music was furnished by the Marine
band.
Mrs. Roosevelt and Miss Roosevelt
were not present at any portion of the
evening's festivities, the company be-
ing limited entirely to gentlemen.
Just before the dinner there was
brought to the White House a large
oil portrait, which was taken to the
private portion of the house. It is
supposed this was a present from the
Prince to the President.
After the dinner the guests repaired
to the parlors, where for an hour or
more they remained in social conver-
sation. The Prince chatted freely with
the company, many of whom he had
met during the day. At 10:30 o'clock
the party dispersed, the Prince leaving
directly for the railroad station, where
his special train awaited him. A
troop of cavalry and a squadron of
mounted and bicycle police acted as
an escort and saw him safely on board
the train which left at midnight for
New York.
A Healthy Body
can only be maintained by pure blood, which
in turn is maintained only by pure food, air and
exercise, whereby internal dis-
turbances, indigestion and exhaustion seem
to disappear. If the blood is impure it will perform its pur-
ifying and life-sustaining functions poorly and
will cause many disorders, and ills and
ailments of mind and body. All men are dependent upon the
blood, and any body, therefore, which
can purify the blood loves the organs and
is in a fair way to maintain health. "Hill's
Herbal Pills" will
cure you of ills and ailments.
