PHOENIX, ARIZONA, AUGUST 6, 1901

Don’t leave the city for mountain
or beach without having The Re
publican accompany you. You will
be lonesome without it.

Suicide is often supposed to exist as
a hereditary tendency, because not in
frequently the child of

SUICIDE a parent who has died

SUGGESTION. followed the parental
example. Yet as it is
doubtful whether even a morbid or
melancholy turn of mind may really be
inherited, it is extremely unlikely that
so definite and specific a perversion of
nature as the tendency to suicide can
be transmitted from father to son.
Several recent cases recorded are of
a character to establish the theory
that the suicide of a son, for instance,
following the suicide of a father, is
purely the result of suggestion or ex
ample. In New Jersey a mother com
mitted suicide on the anniversary of
the day on which her son had died as
the result of a pistol shot presumably
discharged with suicidal intent. A
casuist might claim that if the son
really committed suicide, he might
have inherited from the mother the
tendency which in the mother herself
was not developed until after the
son’s death. But another case, in
which a husband took his life on the
anniversary of his wife’s suicide, in
dicates that the power of example has
much more to do in such a case than
that of inheritance. In still another
case, and on the same day, a woman
committed suicide by jumping from a
cliff in a spot where, many years be
fore, her husband had died by acci
dent.
It would be quite impossible to deny
the melancholy effect of examples of
this sort. The human mind broods
deeply on the self-inflicted death of a
relative or dear friend, until the rea
son is affected, the poise of the mind
destroyed. The suicide’s son, even if he
is too young to know, at the time, of
his father’s manner of death, inevitably
hears the story at last. If concealment
is practiced, and a hush falls at the
mention of the father’s name, the son
learns the truth in time with all the
more eagerness. The sad example
works upon his intelligence. He is very
likely to see and feel the sorrowful
side of life, and if true sorrows and
misfortune oppress him, the picture of
the open door out of trouble which the
father found arises again and again.
The man or woman who is tempted to
suicide should remember that the con
sequences of such an act do not end
with the act itself. They may be far-
reaching and most deplorable.

General Wood’s review of the Cuban
outlook, published in another column,
is eminently gratifying,
THE the more so as he has
NEW been uniformly con-
CUBA. servative in his survey
of conditions there, and
is disposed to judge the future by what
has been actually accomplished. His
view of the new electoral law passed
by the constitutional convention is re
assuring, for the law secures American
supervision of the elections, and that,
it is impossible to deny, is an indis
pensable safeguard for starting the
machinery of the new republic under
the proper auspices.
Cuba would most certainly suffer a
relapse and go wrong if there was not
a good friend near her to help in those
elections. This is the typical cause of
revolution in most of the Latin-
American communities. As to the re
formed municipal governments and the
reformed judiciary, too much can
hardly be said in commendation of
General Wood for the direct share he
has had in those changes, and to him
also is due part of the credit for plac
ing the school system on a firm basis.
With an island free from yellow fever
and only waiting for stable politics to
assume its industry, he may look back
with much satisfaction on his work,
and may safely anticipate the comple
tion of what has been so well done thus
far. History will be searched in vain
for a more signal service to civiliza
tion than has been performed under
his guidance.

The Alabama constitutional conven
tion has complicated its difficulties by
adopting the grand

electors at any time
prior to January 1, 1903. This is mani
festly to allow all the poor whites to
vote irrespective of any other disqual
ification than crime, and to soften the
resentment of those who do not wish
the negro to vote after 1903, even if he
meets the educational and property
tests required of him. It goes to show
that the professions of impartiality for
the negro, which were loud in favor of
the remnant who might be able to
prove themselves politically fit after
the great majority had been put out
of politics, were not altogether sincere,
but are controlled in the last resort, as
might have been expected, by the un
compromising assertion of complete
white ascendancy. Comment is heard
that the clause is unconstitutional, and
has given rise to dissension in the con
vention which may be organized into
permanent opposition afterward. More
than that, the vengeance of a repub
lican congress is expected; but after
the academic measures of punishment
which congress has thus far devised, it
is safe to say that nothing will be
exacted from Alabama for her trans
gression.

Mrs. Carrie Nation’s martyrdom, fol
lowing her attempt to reform Kansas
with a hatchet, now has the lame and
impotent conclusion of her acceptance
of a pardon and the opportunity kindly
given her by the courts to pay her fines
on the installment plan, at the rate of
$5 a month. Though Mrs. Nation has
declined prodigiously as an object of
interest, she will probably be able to
write enough stories for the papers to
enable her to lay by $5 a month over
and above her modest living expenses;
and as she evinces no present disposi
tion to start up with the hatchet again,
the double-column head and the police
court will probably know her no more.
This curious episode in American his
tory, it is to be hoped, is over.

The clock whose bilious face looks
down from the postoffice tower has
probably been relieved of some of its
conceit. During the period of its sus
pended animation the people of Wash
ington went to bed, got up, ate their
meals, went to work on time and
caught suburban trains.

The drouth in the west has stimu
lated the ambition of a number of men
to figure as “corn kings.” The oppor
tunity is at hand, they think, to corner
the grain market as never before. They
will probably find that it is a far cry
from the drouth to a fortune.

Eight hundred and ninety-three per
sons died during 1900 in the Punjab
from snake bite, and Dr. Charles L.
Dana of the Cornell medical college
says hard drinkers cannot last long.
Life insurance rates in the Punjab
must be high.

Judging from comment in the New
York newspapers, those bandits who
hold up trains in the far west ought
to make a dash for Manhattan Island
instead of the Bad Lands or the Hole-in-the-Wall
country.

We will soon hear that Londoners
are studying the American language in
order to improve their pronunciation of
English.

Wonder if anybody took the kaiser’s
temperature when he heard that Co
lombian soldiers had walked on his
flag.

DO YOU WANT
A HOME?
What say you to this proposition?
We will give the first applicant a six-
room house on a well shaded lot 70x137½
for $1000.
This may be paid for $100 cash, and
practically your own time on the bal
ance. Interest on $900 balance to be
paid in monthly installments of $3.50.
Each six months $50 or more may be
paid on the principal and the interest
reduced.
Every $50 paid reduces the interest
35 cents per month. Isn’t this better
than paying rent? Call on

A man was hanged in public in Ar
kansas the other day, and among the
spectators was a 10-year-old boy, who
proceeded to imitate the proceedings.
His life is now in the balance and the
governor of the state will recommend
the repeal of the public execution law.
It should not require such a tragedy
to persuade the state authorities that
outdoor hangings are unwholesome
spectacles.

The sixth article of the code of in
structions drawn up for the guidance
of the new Chinese foreign office con
tains this admonition: “Forget self for
the public.” They have midsummer
humorists in China.

The news from China is that the re
form programme calls for the substitu
tion of the tsung-li-yamen by the wai-wu-pu.
This news is received with in
tense interest and satisfaction.

Uncle Sam has $550,000,000 in gold in
his treasury—enough to give several
of us a farm without any Oklahoma
lottery.

It is hoped that the strike will not
have to be settled as many times as
the Chinese question.

It is more difficult to purify the gov
ernment of Chicago than to clean its
streets.

Spain will manage to struggle along
without a naval board of inquiry.

General Wood, here’s hoping you go
back to Cuba as hearty as a buck!

Senator McLaurin’s democracy would
fit better in Ohio.

NOTHING IS NEW.

An advertisement that is not original
is not necessarily an imitation. Ori
ginality is a myth. A man who says
he is original must say it very quietly
if he does not want the statement dis
puted. If he proclaims it to the world,
hundreds of other men will bob up and
prove that he is not.

There is probably not an advertise
ment appearing in the magazines today
that can be called strictly original.
Every one has been suggested by some
one else. Not necessarily by some
other ad, but by something gained from
some other source than the writer’s
brain.

It is not necessary to be what the
world calls original to be successful.
If a man is going to dig out all his
ideas from the time he is born and
not rely to some extent upon the ideas
of others, he will be dead before he is
able to talk.

It sometimes happens that two men
on opposite sides of the continent sim
ultaneously produce an advertisement
the central thought of which is exactly
the same. Whereupon the advertise
ment publications seize upon both, re
produce them in deadly parallel and
clamor loudly for the man who stole
from the other to stand before his
brothers and confess.

The truth is that neither copied from
the other, but both drew their inspira
tion from the same source.

Originality in advertising is only ori
ginal in the association of ideas, and
he who can do that cleverly is as near
an original being as an advertisement
maker needs to get.
