AN
AN IMPORTANT DEAL.
Mining Property Located on the Strip
Banded
The Kirk and Hansen Cross Pine group of mines on the south
slope of Mount Turnbull in Graham
county have been bonded to Dr. O. M.
Ruff, Mr. Beiser and others for $22,
500. There are four mines in the
group.
The final papers closing the deal
were signed on the 23d inst. Already
a large force of eleven men have been put
to work to sink down an incline shaft
5x9 feet on the Richard Stonewall.
Three shifts of eight hours each will
be the program, to be continued until
a depth of 200 feet is reached.
The Richard Stonewall is a promising property. Where the work is be
ing done they have a ledge eight to
eleven feet wide of smelting ore, eight
or nine inches of which is high grade
shipping ore. The work is being done
under the supervision of Mr. Beiser,
who is a first-class practical miner.
They have christened it "Camp Leb
anon," after Dr. Ruff's home town in
Illinois. Ere many months Camp
Lebanon will be counted among the
sure copper producing properties of
Arizona.
Uncle Billy Albritton, one of the
principal owners, and who has more
very promising properties on the Strip,
was the moving spirit in making the
deal.
Safford will be the company's head
quarters, says the Guardian.
IN YUMA COUNTY.
Yuma county's mining doings dur-
ing the past week included the sale by
Chicago and Los Angeles people of the
old Polhamus group of copper claims,
in Seneca mining district, including
what are at present known as the
Gregory, Grand Cross, Garfield, Grant,
Homestake, Boston and Bay State
mines, owned by D. J. Shackrow and
James May, says the Yuma Sun. The
property is an old and extensively de
veloped property, which has produced
many thousands of pounds of bullion,
and the price of $50,000, $6,000 of
which has been paid down, is consid
ered an exceedingly moderate figure.
During the original working of these
mines the ore was shipped to Swansea,
Wales, and the average was amply
rich enough to yield satisfactory re
turns. The occasional striking of rich
and extensive chambers raised the ag
gregate of profits to a handsome figure,
but the low price of copper and the
extortionate freighting rates finally
necessitated the cessation of activity.
This group is but one of many the
development of which is likely to
make Seneca district famous, and we
are pleased to note the present move
ment. Messrs. Shackrow and May left last
Tuesday for Los Angeles, where they
will spend a couple of months.
DEEP MINING IN AFRICA.
Operating to Great Depths by Relays
is Undertaken There.
A proposition to work mines to a
depth of 8,000 feet is now being con
sidered in South Africa, says a corre
spondent of the Mining and Scientific
Press. That this can be accomplished
by the establishment of relay winding
stations at distances of 2,500 to 3,000
feet, and of pumping stations at half
overcoming the problems of deep min-
ing. An important question will be
that of ventilation, but the introduc
tion of electric fans is going to do
something for ventilation also.
That the cost will be greater when
operating by relays to the depth of
8,000 to 10,000 feet than from a depth
of 5,000 feet already an accomplished
fact goes without saying, but a sin
gle operation can be carried on to a
depth of 10,000 feet at a cost consid
erably below that of operating two
lifts. The mine plant should be large and provided
with a sufficient number of compart
ments to afford large capacity. Hav
ing reached the depth of the first relay
winding station at say 3,000 feet it
would be necessary to excavate a large
chamber and support it by such means
as would render it safe, dry and per
manent. In this must be installed the
first auxiliary hoisting machine, for
hoisting from the level of the next re
lay station. If only one relay station
is to be established, compressed air
would be employed to advantage, but
for all purposes ventilation, pump
ing, hoisting, haulage, etc., electricity
would probably be the best, and in the
event of more than one relay station it
is undoubtedly the best.
When sinking shall commence below
the level of the first relay station the
shaft should be offset a distance suffi
cient to allow space of not less than
five feet between the two shafts. This
partly as a precaution against accident
to men on the station level and
partly to avoid danger of a breach in
the wall between the sump of the up-
per shaft and the relay shaft. Cars
hoisted on the cages in the relay shaft
could then be run onto the cages going
to the surface, and hoisting continued
without dumping or any further re-
handling.
When the level of the second relay
station has been reached a second
chamber should be cut out and equip-
ped in the same manner as the first,
and the shaft again continued on an
offset as above, being located either di-
rectly under the first section of the last
shaft or still farther over in the direc-
tion of the first offset. The character
of the formation on the level would
perhaps determine this.
This idea contemplates a vertical
shaft which sunk through barren
rock to an ore bed or vein, as at the
Lake Superior copper mines, or the
mines of the Witwatersrand in South
Africa, though equally applicable to a
vein having levels. The same plan
could be applied to inclined shafts
sunk upon or parallel with the dip of
a vein. The idea is susceptible of
more or less change in the detail, as
for instance where skips would be
dumped at the relay stations into bins
on the level, or into pockets cut out
under the floor of the level from which
skips operating in the next section
above would be loaded. Where ex
tensive operations are contemplated,
cages would prove the more economi
cal whether in inclined shaft or verti
cal, unless the dip of the shaft be too
low to admit the use of cages such
as are constructed for use in inclines.
The generating plant on the surface
would have to be powerful enough to
supply all the power required to oper
ate all hoisting and pumping engines,
ventilating devices, and should also do
the hauling underground. The first
cost of plant would be great, of course,
but that the working expenses would
greatly exceed that at mines working
from great depth by a single lift is im
probable. MINING NOTES.
Grading is being done north of the
Old Dominion smelter for more ore
bins.
A new 160-ton furnace is being
erected on a line with the entrance to
the engine room at the Old Dominion.
This gives more room to the other fur
naces. The engine room is now one
of the best in the territory, says the
Globe Times. The new smelting engine,
a simple Corliss, 22x30, runs as smooth
ly as a bicycle, comparatively. The
heavy foundation does not allow the
least jar. There is a No. 7 Connersville
blower in this room and space is
left for another, that no doubt will be
added before the year closes. W. P.
Reynolds, one of the engineers, is very
proud of the machinery.
The new hoisting engine at the Old
Dominion mining is the largest in the
territory, and in size, is 20x60 cylin
ders, double acting double reel hoist,
operating two flat ropes xV2, either
simply or in balance and capable of
hoisting a double deck cage with two
cars from a depth of 2,000 feet. The
building to cover this machinery will
be in size 45x60.
At the United Globe smelters the
work is moving as usual. The present
month will show a good output of
bullion.
Douglass L. Browne returned from
New York to Globe via Mineral Creek
Tuesday, after observing the develop
ments on the properties he owned.
The claims of W. B. Collom, Thomas
Kavanaugh and Frank Gill were bon
ded by Mr. Browne, although there was
not any ore in sight on these claims.
The general character of the country
satisfied the purchaser. Work was
started on the Ham Tiger. Kavanaugh
returned from New York a fifty-foot
shaft was down on each of the claims,
showing the richest bodies of ore in
the camp. Work is progressing on all
the company's claims on Mineral
creek. A company has been formed
called the United Arizona, with a cap
ital of $2,500,000. John P. Jones is
president, Charley Lane and Charles
E. Sherman are directors. There are
two bank presidents also interested.
Evidently Mr. Browne has sufficient
finance for several days placing it in
position in the building, under the di
rection of Mr. Ryan, a thorough smel
ter man from Globe. Within a very
few days the fires will be lighted and
copper left to run from the furnaces.
A full load of coke arrived yesterday and
will be handled to the smelter immedi
ately. Arrangements are also about
completed for a steady force of teams
to haul ore from the mines. Several
mine owners have been in during the
last week making arrangements for
selling their ores to the company and
it is likely that sufficient ore will be
available within a short time to run
the smelter steadily. We are informed
that within the next ten days or two
weeks the company's store at this place
will be opened and stocked up with a
full line of merchandise, affording

ONE MINER'S LUCK
AT rr Hope Hid Left He Slumb ed
Over a Nugget Worth $3,000.
This man had reached the very last
of his resources without finding a
trace of the camp fires. Next morning
early, after a great deal of sleep and
very little food, he braced himself up
to go back and fetch his tools, though
he carefully explained that he would
not have taken the trouble to do this
if he had not felt that his pick and
barrow were about his only posses
sions, and might fetch the price of a
meal or two when it came to the last.
I have often wondered since if the
impression of the divine mercy and
goodness which was so strong in that
man's mind just then has ever worn
off. His description with splen-did horror
on how he looked at his luck, at
his face, at everything as he stumbled
back that hot morning over his tracks
of the day before. The way seemed
twice as long, for, as he said, his
"heart was too heavy to carry." At
last he saw his barrow and pick stand
ing up on the flat plain a little way
off, and was wearisomely dragging on toward them when he caught his toe
against a stone deeply imbedded in the
sand and fell down. His voice sank
in a sort of awe-struck whisper as if
it were almost a confession as he
said:
"Well, ma'am, if you'd believe me, I
cursed awful. I felt as if it was too
hard altogether to bear. To think
that I should go on and nearly break
my toe against the only stone in the
district and with all those miles to
travel back! So I lay there like Job's
friend and cursed God and wanted to
die. After a bit I felt like a passionate
child who kicks and breaks the
thing which has hurt him, and I had
to beat that stone before I could feel
quiet. But it was too firm in the
sand for my hands to get it so in
my rage I set out briskly with the pick
to break up that stone, if it took all
my strength. It was pretty deep set
in the ground, I assure you, ma'am; but
at last I got it up and here it is solid
gold and nearly as big as a baby's
head. Now, ma'am, I ask you, did I
deserve this?"
He almost banged the rather dirty
looking lump down on the table before
me as he spoke, and it certainly was a
wonderful sight, and a still more won
derful weight. He told me he had
searched about the neighborhood of
that nugget all day, but there was not
the faintest trace of any more gold. So
as he had no time to lose on account of
the shortness of the food and water
supply, he started back to the coast,
which he reached quite safely and
came down to Perth in the first steamer.
The principal bank had advanced
him $800 on his nugget, but it would
probably prove to be worth twice as
much. I asked him what he was going
to do, and was sorry to hear him say
that he intended to go back to Eng
land and set up a shop or a farm I
forget which among his own people.
Of course it was not for us to decide
him, but I felt it was a pity to
lose such a good sort of man out of
the colony, for he was not spending
his money in champagne and card
playing, as new successful gold
finders did in those first days. Corn
