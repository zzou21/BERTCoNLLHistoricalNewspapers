This Date in History-July 4.

1776—Declaration of Independence adopted by the Congress of the United Colonies of America, commonly called the Continental Congress; the committee reported it just as Thomas Jefferson wrote it, but the engrossed was finished and signed as on the 3d of July; each autograph signed by every member except one, including a few who were not members on July 4; total signers 56.
1804 Nathaniel Hawthorne, author, born at Salem, Mass.; died 1864.
1803—Loafer Ames, American statesman and president of Harvard college, died.
1826 John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, second and third presidents, died. Just fifty years after votes for the Declaration of Independence.
1831—James Monroe, fifth president, died in New York city, being the third president who died on Independence Day.
1852—William L. Marcy, three times Governor of New York and head of President Pierce's Cabinet, died without a moment's previous illness, of heart disease.
1863—Battle of Green River Bridge, Ky., between Morgan's advance and a company of the Twenty-fifth Michigan; Grant's army entered Vicksburg; desperate battle at Helena, Ark.; Confederates charged on strong fortifications and were repulsed with loss of near 1,500, one-fourth those engaged; federal loss, 341.
1879—Cetewayo with 30,000 Zulus attacked 4,000 British at Ulundi; Zulu army annihilated.

The Alligator.
Quite a popular fad nowadays is a taste for live alligators. They are taken in the rivers of Florida by negroes when very young, placed in boxes and sent through the postoffice to friends in the north, and often emerge to find themselves in some very fashionable houses in New York. The alligator is not a cheerful companion, as he spends most of his time in sleep. It is only when he is hungry that he displays any social qualities or animation. The penchant for alligators is not likely to be a lasting one, for in the course of time they develop greatly in size, and then it is not safe to leave the baby in the immediate vicinity. New York News.

I commenced putting them up (I mean those Blood and Liver pills), in Portland, and had a boy distribute a sample to each house. A curious juvenile about five years old followed my boy and gathered up the samples. They were over-eating and he tackled the whole collection in his neighborhood. That night there was a sad household, but they saved most of the pills.
Next day I received an extended lecture from his dear mama, but I so convinced her of their value when taken according to directions, that she used and afterwards endorsed them highly. You know what they're for—any blood or liver trouble, headache, lassitude, and all that sort of things, and they do the work better and easier than anything I know.

The weather tomorrow is likely to be fine.
The Loom in spring advertising.
Spring is the season when the young
man's fancy lightly turns to thought of dress. The young woman's imagination is monotonously directed toward the numberless spring things and consideration of the bargain counter.
Now is the time to advertise. Buyers are looking for bargains, and they invariably turn to the columns for announcements. You can expect them to look you up and ask if you have anything to sell.
Style is of paramount importance in advertising. I have lately given some thinking complied of the possibilities in this line lately. Probably they have caught your eye. That is what they're for. That particular form of advertising works wonders in John Wanamaker's business, and is known as the Wanamaker style. It has made his fortune. Advertising will make your fortune if you have energy and nerve.
Type of column.
Such a location is very desirable and
effective. But it's cheap at any
price. If your goods are all wool they
seem to rank high in our columns,
but to a well-worded and tactfully designed advertisement piece of position is essential, it will attract attention anywhere.
Next to reading matter.
Advertisers who have a predilection
for placing their announcements as
early as possible to genuine reading
matter, where it appeals insidiously to
the wandering eye of the reader and
distracts his attention from the Crisis
in Europe to the Crisis in Crash Towel
rugs or the latest thing in haberdashery.
Speaking of reading notices.
We can put your announcement in
plain words, in plain type and in plain
sight of every casual reader. This form of
advertising proves exceedingly remunerative in some cases.
Run of the paper.
The advertiser who has sufficient faith
in the integrity and discretion of our
accomplished foreman to trust to his
judgment in the location and display of
advertisements never gets left in the
long run. Change is a law of nature,
and it is well to apply it in your business announcements. Variety is the spice of advertising.
