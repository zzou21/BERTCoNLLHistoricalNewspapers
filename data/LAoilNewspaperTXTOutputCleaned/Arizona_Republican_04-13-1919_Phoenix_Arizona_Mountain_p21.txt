THE IMPROVED FORD

SEDAN MIRRORS THE
TASTE OF PURCHASER

A Ford car may just as well express
the taste and individuality of the owner
as anything that may be purchased,
and when one states that all of Henry
Ford's products look alike they should
limit the statement to "the average

Ford," just as the average car of any
other make looks like its brother.
When the business that a man has
made a success of is due to his
artistic sense of proportion, an ability
to create beauty out of plainness, and
a deftness in so harmonizing a person
to his or her dress that it almost
amounts to genius, that man would be
expected to look for or create beauty
in anything he purchased with the
same skill used in making a success
of his business. This is exactly what
has happened in the case of the Ford
sedan purchased by Charles K. Heath,
the photographer from Ed Rudolph
last week. As Ed Rudolph expresses
it, Mr. Heath knew just exactly what
he wanted, and the softly-toned green
body contrasted with the white wire
wheels, and the many deft touches that
can be given to any object to bring
out its fine points has been given to
this Ford sedan at Mr. Heath's orders.
It is one of the neatest looking, mod
erately priced cars that has ever been
seen in Phoenix, and Mr. Heath is to
be congratulated on his good taste.
As he states, "The Ford sold itself."
He has been importuned by every auto
mobile salesman in Phoenix to look,
ride, or buy any and every make of
car on the market. However, Mr.
Heath decided to buy a moderately
priced car, and in reply to one sales
man he remarked, "I should rather
buy the best that Henry Ford makes
than the poorest that your company
sells." The last shot fired at Mr. Heath
by a group of salesmen to whom he
explained he had decided upon the
Ford sedan, was that if he purchased
one of their cars he would have free
service, but no service was given on a
Ford by Ed Rudolph. Heath replied
that when a man's business has grown
to the volume of Ed. Rudolph's it must
be based upon fair treatment to its
customers and he would take a chance.
It is not believed that any man is
taking a chance when he deals with
Ed Rudolph.

COLE IS SELLING FAST

As an aftermath of the automobile
show season the Cole Motor Car com
pany of Indianapolis reports unpre
cedented sales wherever its product,
the Cole aero eight, was exhibited.
These gratifying results are attribu
ted largely to the advanced engineer
ing features and aero-type construction
which have gained for the Cole aero
eight an enviable reputation.

Pierce Trucks
Lower Cost Of
Milk Delivery

With the cessation of hostilities in
Europe and the signing of the armistice
the Cole Motor Car company increased
its production 100 per cent, thereby
assuring deliveries of its product in
substantial quantities. Since that
time it has further increased its pro
duction.

The goal, however, has not yet been
reached. By the close of 1919 produc
tion will have been increased almost a
half more or 130 per cent over that
of 1918.
At the present orders are being re
ceived at double the rate cars can be
manufactured. Many dealers are over
selling their allotment and are placing
orders twice within the month. All are
anticipating sales and are placing their
orders accordingly 30 days in advance.
The dealers, fully aware of the con
ditions, are passing the word to the
buyers, advising those who contem
plate the purchase of a car to order
for immediate delivery.
That prospective buyers are heeding
this advice is evident from the un
usual number of sales at the various
shows throughout the country and sub
sequent orders.

Do

You Know

that a tire, like a chain is no stronger
than its weakest link. When a tire
leaves the factory it is inspected for
weak or defective fabric but just as
soon as a casing is punctured or
bruised it is bound to be weakened at
that particular point, and unless
promptly and properly repaired will
result disastrously.
Don't put off from day to day neces
sary repairs on your tires. Bring
them in now the longer you wait the
more it will cost you to repair them.
WHEN YOU THINK of a new tire
think of a HORSE SHOE.
A 5000-mile guaranteed tire made to
stand rough roads and hard driving.
Ask any user.

De Palma Used

Red Crown Gas
On Record Run

When Ralph de Palma, in a trial lap
over the Santa Monica course, broke
the world's road race record recently,
he was running on the Standard Oil
company's Red Crown gasoline. De
Palma covered the course at an aver
age rate of 93.38 miles per hour, the
fastest officially recorded speed ever
made on any road course in the world.
It is a remarkable tribute to the
full and dependable power of Red
Crown that it should have been the
choice of the greatest automobile driv
er of the day, and that through its use
he was able to set up such a remark
able record. The gasoline supplied him
was not in any way specially made
for the purpose, but De Palma filled his
tank from the regular gasoline wagon
on the garage floor of the Packard
representative in Los Angeles.
This record again demonstrates the
truth of the Standard Oil company's
claim that Red Crown, straight-distilled,
all-refinery gasoline, with its
full and continuous chain of boiling
points, is absolutely dependable for
easy starting, quick and smooth accel
eration, full power and long mileage.
CLEANING TOOLS
It is a good plan to wipe off all tools
on a bit of oily waste before restor
ing them to the tool box. The oil de
posited on the metal keeps it from
rusting, which is a trouble to be guard
ed against itself.

FARMERS LEARN THE
VALUE OF TRAILERS

Under the caption, "We Cover the Country Like a Blanket," the B. F.
Goodrich Rubber company tells its
dealers and patrons that the newspaper
is the best advertising medium known
to man.
In a current issue of the Goodrich
Magazine appears an article on news
paper advertising which has a message
for every business man. The article
is headed, "Every Goodrich Newspaper
ad. reaches from 50,000,000 to 60,000,000
people. 2,000 papers carry 1919 Goodrich
message." The article itself reads as follows:
"Our major effort this year will be
in the daily newspapers. This is the
people's medium more widely read
and more generally circulated than any
type of advertisement known to man.
Newspaper advertising is not only the
most direct way to sell the customer,
but it is likewise the most satisfactory
from your own standpoint as a dealer.
Often you can, at a very small expense,
insert your ad. near our big ones and
get the benefit of our ad. In other
words, we sell the tire, and then you
come along and say "and you can get
them from us.'
"We shall use a unique and effective
type of ad. this year, single and double
column size running the full length of
the paper. We are thus sure of a good
location and the prospect will soon get
the force of this characteristic type of
space."

"Great interest is being displayed
by the farmers of this valley in trailers
for use behind their passenger cars.
The use of which has now become the
universal custom in California," says
C. W. Hartrant, distributor for the
Utility trailers. "Farmers cannot af
ford to be without trailers. I am a
farmer and dairyman myself. I also
raise cotton, pigs and sheep and from
experience know the value of a trailer.
"I owned one a year before I em
barked in this business; during that
time I never had a team on the road
except to deliver cotton. I could not
spare my trailer for that work as the
gin would not unload promptly. How
ever, I have been assured that the de
lay in unloading at the gin will not
occur this season so the farmer with
cotton to haul in the fall might as well
get a trailer now and have the use
of it during the spring and summer
for other purposes.
"I hauled everything I raised last
year to market except cotton as stated
above, on a 1,500 lbs. capacity Utility
trailer behind a Ford car; milk, hay,
an 1,800 lbs. bull, dry cows for the
butcher, pigs and sheep. The stock
was delivered to destination without
shrinkage which you know is a con
siderable item when animals are
driven. I would be at loss on the
ranch without a trailer and would like
to tell every farmer in the Salt River
valley in person my experience with a
Utility trailer and explain how he can
acquire one."

"BICYCLE WEEK" IS COMING

A continuation of the rejuvenation
of the bicycle which resulted from
the stimulus given to every form of
transportation by the war is the pur
pose of a "bicycle week" to be ob
served throughout the country May
3 to 10. The United States Tire com
pany and manufacturers of bicycles
and cycle supplies are aiding in the
drive.

A recent development in the tractor
field is announced. The Southern Bor
der Motor company of this city has
taken over the state agency for the
Hart-Parr tractor. C. E. Stromberg,
local branch manager, in obtaining
this agency has secured one of the
best known and up-to-date tractors on
the market. The Hart-Parr is a new
machine in this field but has proven
itself an excellent performer in the
east. In speaking of the Hart-Parr,
Mr. Stromberg said:-
"The first official test for tractors
in 1919 was won by the Hart-Parr
tractor at the big demonstration held
in Columbus, Ohio, under the direction
of the Ohio State University. The
Hart-Parr was officially credited with
producing 37 horse power which is
5 horse power more than any other
tractors in the field. In the fuel
economy test the Hart-Parr had but
one close competitor, and this machine
also led the field in the reserve horse
power development in the maximum
load test. This machine has two cy
linders, four-cycle motor, valve-in-head
type. Cast steel frame, sliding trans
mission, and all other latest devices
known to the tractor machines.
"The Southern Border Motor com
pany expects its first shipment of
these tractors within the next few
days and will conduct a public demon
stration to exhibit the ability and per
formance of this new machine."

ENGLISH TRACK TO BE REPAIRED

Advices from England indicate that
the famous Brooklands race track,
which during the war was allowed to
deteriorate into a condition unsafe for
high speeds, is to be repaired. The
Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders will assist the Brooklands Au
tomobile Racing club in restoring the
famous speedway to its former excel
lent condition, preparatory to the re
vival of racing in England.
This track, which is of concrete con
struction, for some time held many of
the world's automobile speed records,
until new ones were set up by De Palma
and Chevrolet in the American
speedway races of 1917 and 1918. It is
noteworthy that the new world's speed
records were established on Goodyear
cord tires of the straight side type,
whereas the English records were made
on tires of the clincher type. Racers
have come to appreciate the additional
speed and the greater degree of freedom
from trouble that straight side
tires permit. All of the important
American racing drivers are now using
this type of tire.

RIM PASTE

Many car owners employ a paste
made of flake graphite and linseed oil
to rub on the inner surface of the
rim before putting the casing in place.
This prevents rust forming on the rim
and eliminates sticking by the casing.

You Can Get
White Trucks
Again
For months withdrawn from commercial service to
supply our armies, White Trucks are again obtain
able by commercial users.
As the urgency of government demands has de
creased, the company is now in a position to begin
making shipments of the 1 1/2-ton model adopted as
the standard U. S. army truck of this capacity.
Shipments of other models will follow as rapidly as
materials can be secured in quantity and put in pro
duction. The 1-ton model, as well as the 3-ton and
5-ton chain driven trucks are now available, to soon
be followed by heavy duty trucks of 3 and 5 ton ca
pacity with the new Double Reduction Gear Drive.
