THE HELVETIA.
What Mr. Hoar Has to Say of the New
Camp.
Mr. Martin R. Hoar returned yester
day morning from a two weeks' visit to
the southern part of the territory. He
spent some time in Globe, Bisbee and
other mining camps where he noted a
great deal of prosperity. Mr. Hoar vis
ited Tucson and from there went to
the Helvetia mining camp, which is
located forty miles south of the Old
Pueblo in the Santa Rita mountains.
Probably the most rapid growth in
recent years of any mining camp in
the territory was shown by Helvetia
camp since it sprang into existence
last spring. Where there was scarcely
any life six months ago, today is lo
cated a camp of six hundred people.
The Helvetia is one of the most pro
gressive camps in Arizona. It is in
the hands of safe and conservative
mining men, and persons familiar with
the property are confident that the
Helvetia will become one of the bo
nanza copper properties of the south
west in a few years.
"The papers of Arizona are laboring
under a wrong impression," said Mr.
Hoar, "when they say that the Hel
vetia is owned by the Calumet &
Hecla people. They probably got this
idea because the most of the gentle
men connected with the mine are from
Michigan. The real owners are W. H.
Paine, of Boston; J. W. Seager, of
Houghton, Mich.; Frank Fellows, of
Chicago, and S. L. Smith, of Detroit.
The Calumet & Hecla company has a
number of copper claims in Sonora,
but they have no interest in the Hel
vetia." Mr. Hoar says that the Helvetia
company owns fifty-six claims alto
gether, and development work has be
gun on a great many of them. Pros
pecting some of the claims has been
done by the use of a diamond drill, and
the result of this work has been satis
factory to the company. They are
going ahead as though they feel im
plicit confidence in the value of their
claims, and Mr. Hoar says that the
company will spend $500,000 in devel
opment work.
"The work at present," continued Mr.
Hoar, "consists of developing the prop
erty and adding a smelter for the pro
duction of copper matte. At the present
time there are 300 men on the pay roll.
The smelter will be completed by the
first of November, and a crew of men
will soon be at work placing a narrow
gauge track from the farthest claims
to the smelter and an engine and cars
will be placed on it for hauling the
ore. The distance is over a mile. A
schoolhouse will be built by the com
pany, and a new store building which
has just been completed will be occu
pied by the company on Monday. The
camp has had a remarkable growth,
and from what I could learn of the
company's intentions, it is just in the
first stages of its growth.
"A big strike was made on the
Heavy Weight claim last Thursday.
The indications point to the discovery
of a very large body of ore on this
claim. On the Old Dick claim a tun
nel has been driven which penetrated
several veins, showing considerable
value in copper. The tunnel was driv
en simply to reach a shaft and supply
air to its depths."

COFFER IN YAVAPAI.

The Red Metal Seemingly Taking the
Lead Over Gold.

For years the citizens of this county
have classed the larger part of Yava
pai county as a gold producer, and as
such we have no reason to be ashamed
of its record, says the Journal-Miner.
Later the United Verde astonished us
with its remarkable wealth of copper,
and many miners still cling to the idea
that the Jerome district was an excep
tion and that gold would still predom
inate in the balance of the county. But
from the way development is proving
up in the big mines it is growing more
apparent that gold is a by-product and
that copper is the predominating
metal. Recognizing this it is but rea
sonable to speculate a little upon the
future of old Yavapai.
If the developments now under way
keep pace with those prosecuted dur
ing the last year, we may expect to see
this county outstrip the combined
product of every other county in Ari
zona and eventually the great Silver
Bow
region of Montana. This paper
has never fully realized the magnitude
of the copper resources of the county
and their possibilities until its editor
took recent trips into the mining dis
tricts south and east of Prescott. There
the greatest activity prevails and the
life of that activity centers in copper.
Everywhere legitimate mining is being
prosecuted there springs up evidence
of copper wealth.

If jealousy were to
die out hell would be depopulated.

MINING NOTES.

A British Columbia miner has in
vented a hammer hand sling, which is
intended to be an assistance to miners
when drilling an overhead hole. The
idea is to transfer the weight of the
hammer from the handle grasped by
the hand to the wrist or forearm by a
sling connecting the head of the ham
mer and the wrist of the operator and
a clutch connecting the handle of the
hammer to the sling, so that the work
man can sling the hammer and strike
the drill without the effort of constant
ly grasping the hammer handle.
Ore teams are busy hauling in ore
for the Nyack mining company, which
will be shipped to the El Paso smelter.
This is a new company, but it is com
posed of the men that possess the
prospects that will insure more suc
cess in the future than even the good
success of the past. Williams News.
Rev. L. A. Rockwell of Chicago, one
of the members of the Mount Turnbull
Copper Mining and Smelting company,
visited the mines owned by the com
pany in the strip last week. He thor
oughly examined the mines and was
certainly well pleased for when he re
turned to Thomas he sent the follow
ing telegram east: "Better than rep
resented; cf immense value." This
telegram stated the truth. G. R. Ruff,
also a member of the company, is now
in Safford and will remain for some
time. Graham Guardian.
Mr. and Mrs. M. L. Qualey were visit
ors in the city from Solomonville last
Tuesday and spent the day with Frank
D. and Charles Qualey, says the Guard
ian. Mr. Qualey has ordered gasoline
engines and other machinery for hoist
ing purposes to be erected on the shaft
he proposes sinking on his property
recently purchased in the Lone Star
district. Development work is under
the supervision of E. W. C. Day, whose
headquarters are at the mines, where
his family is now comfortably located.

THE JOKER.

"I never can tell a story and have it
come out all right," said a little wo
man plaintively the other day. "I
thought it was pretty good, and
I’d try it on Charlie at supper. But
when I told him to go buy 10 cents’
worth of potash he never said a word,
and I knew another joke had fallen
flat and kept still. But the worst was
later. He put on his hat and vanished
after supper, coming back in a minute
with a little parcel that he handed to
me.
‘What’s that?’ asked I.
‘Why, the potash you said you
wanted,’ answered he, and I nearly
had hysterics on the spot. Did you
ever hear anything so perfectly awful?
I won’t ever try to get off anything
funny again."
And the little woman sighed as she
walked away. Cleveland Plain Dealer.
