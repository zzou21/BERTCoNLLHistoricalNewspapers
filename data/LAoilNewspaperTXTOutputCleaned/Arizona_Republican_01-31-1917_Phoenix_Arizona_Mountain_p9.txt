FINANCES AND
MARKETS

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Jan. 30. (Wall Street)
An early break in New Haven, forcing
that stock down four points to
354, its lowest record, was the most
disconcerting feature of the day's
hesitating market.
At midday prices again evinced an
easier tendency, with United States
Steel as the center of attraction. Steel
on a turnover of 140,000 shares, or
about 25 per cent of the day's total
operations, fluctuated between 113 1/4,
and 111, with a net gain of a
point at 113. The extra dividend of
1 per cent, making a total of 5 1/2
per cent in regular and extra dividends
for the past year was somewhat under
expectations. Earnings for the quarter
were almost $106,000,000. Low-priced
rails were active mainly at higher levels,
particularly Southern Railway which
gained two points.
There were the usual mixed movements
in specialties. Bethlehem Steel
made an early gain of five points
only to fall 1 1/4 and closed at a net
loss of 8 points. Total sales amounted
to 555,000 shares.
Bonds were irregular some representative
issues losing ground, with
further free offerings of St. Louis and
San Francisco adjustment 6's. Total
sales, par value, $4,410,000. United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
CHICAGO GRAIN
CHICAGO, Jan. 30. Fears that a
predicted cold wave might harm unprotected
portions of the winter crop
tended to give strength to the wheat
market today. Prices closed strong,
3 1/4 to 4 1/4 net higher, with May at
$1.75 1/4 to and July at $1.49 1/4 to .
Corn scored a gain of 1 to 1c,
and oats 1 to 1c Provisions finished
unchanged to 1 7/8 higher.
Wheat at first showed much greater
advances in the new crop futures
than in the May option, but in the end
the nearer month had the lead.
Throughout the day, advances had
been stimulated by denials that Great
Britain was preparing to arm merchantmen
forward as well as astern.
Announcement that flour sales at
Minneapolis had been the largest in
weeks helped to inspire buying of
wheat.
Indications of expert buying lifted
corn. There was said also to be a
good demand from domestic industrial
sources. Oats followed other cereals
upward. Seaboard inquiry was hampered
by railway congestion.
Forecasts of a blizzard which might
restrict the marketing of livestock put
firmness into provisions. Close:
Wheat May $1.75 1/4; July $1.49 1/4.
Corn May 99c; July 99c.
Oats May 58c; July 54 1/2c.
Pork May $30.00; July
Lard May $16.12; July $16.77.
Lard May $15.72; July $15.82.

MARKET NEWS
By R. Allyn Lewis
People are afraid to buy the market
because they talk about a re-adjustment
of values. We will admit that
in many of the manufacturing stocks,
but certainly the prices railroads are
selling they are already re-adjusted.
New York Central earning the money
it is today and selling around 101 is
not selling on what it is earning, it is
selling on what they are afraid it
will not earn in the future.
United States Steel declared regular
quarterly dividend of 1 1/4 on
common and 1 extra. Steel earnings
$105,000,000.
Steel net earnings for the quarter
$105,968,347.
There is scarcely a railroad in the
country which is not going better than
it has ever done in its history. Their
business is improved just as the business
of industry has, but their prices
have lost.
The Street had a chance to ruminate
still further upon the statement
made rather confidently in some quarters
that the "motor shares were sold
out." They were weak even at the
start when others were strong and
later they led the market down.
The right people are picking up
railroad stocks all the time. If they
are not good nothing in the country
is. They are selling lower than they
were 2 years before the war.
There is accumulation going in on
Southern Railway; think the crowd
who put it up before getting ready
for another move.
Heaviness in St. Paul has had as
much to do with the breaking market
as anything else. The selling was
liquidation by disgusted holders and
shorts.

Lot Prices Cut 20
Let Us See What This Saving
Amounts to
It is one-fifth of the whole. It is the entire
earnings of one year in five.
Added to your life, you could reach 84
instead of 70. Added to your income
you could sit idly every fifth year without
impairing your present total. In
paying for a home it means that the task
of five years could be finished in four.
Buying a lot, it means that you pay only
four-fifths of the price, because you
were quick to see and to grasp the opportunity.
You Can Have a $387.50 Lot
for Just $310.00
Besides that, one lot in each block will be
reduced $50.03 below the 20 per
cent cut, providing you build. This means
that a $387.50 lot will sell for $260.

MESA NEWS NOTES
Ranchers, their families and others
contemplating attending the sessions
of the Farmers' short course on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday of this week
should not fail to be present at the
opening session at 10 o'clock Thursday
morning. Dr. A. J. Chandler of Chandler,
who is above all things a good
road enthusiast, will talk on the question
of good roads from the standpoint
of the farmer. Another address well
worth the hearing will be that of
Dwight B. Heard, who at 11 o'clock
Thursday morning will discuss the
livestock situation. Mr. Heard is president
of the National Livestock association
and has just returned from a
convention where questions pertaining
to all phases of the livestock industry
were fully discussed.
The afternoon sessions of the first
day will be equally interesting, providing
as they do a home economics course
for women and talks and livestock
demonstrations by Prof. Barnes of the
university, and others who are local
men.
WHERE TO EAT AT COURSE
In connection with the Farmers short
course, comes that all-important question,
"What and where shall visitors
eat." The domestic science class of the
seventh and eighth grades of the East
school will provide luncheon on Thursday
noon. On Saturday the high school
will serve a basket luncheon at the
high school, and the Rebekah lodge
has arranged to serve roast pig on
Friday noon at the K. of P. hall.
Reasonable charges will be made for
the luncheons.
H. A. PRICE RETURNS
H. A. Price, local manager for the
Golden Rule store, returned yesterday
from a trip to Utah and California.
While in Salt Lake City he attended
a conference of the managers of the
125 stores belonging to the Penny and
company corporation. 150 were seated
at table.
GONE FISHING
W. K. Bowen, Hugh Dana, Supervisor,
Peterson and several others went to
Blue Point yesterday afternoon for a
night's camp and fishing. Indications
are that the crowd will be dry even
though the water be wet.

TEMPE NEWS NOTES

of the Tempe Community club
from the coast, a meeting of the board
of directors of the organization has
been called and it will be held at the
hall tomorrow evening at 5:30 o'clock.
A host of matters are due for consideration

pass a busy session within the limited
time they will have. The selection of

among the matters considered.
SHOES PROVE COSTLY
Sixty days in the county jail at
Phoenix was the sentence imposed by
Justice Cummins yesterday morning
on Francisco Martinez who appeared
before him charged with the theft of
a pair of shoes from the Hyder store
last week. The man committed his
offense while he had a clerk in the
back of the store waiting on him and
for several days the shoes were not
missed. A similar attempt by two of
Martinez' partners a few days later
confirmed his guilt and when Marshal
Browning made the arrest yesterday
morning Martinez, through the fact
that he had the missing shoes on then
had no loophole of escape or any
excuses to make.
