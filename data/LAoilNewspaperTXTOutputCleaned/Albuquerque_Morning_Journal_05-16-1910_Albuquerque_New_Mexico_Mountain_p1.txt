"At the naval observatory the scientists have been watching the comet through powerful telescopes every
morning just before sunrise, when it
is brightest. The comet's tail
is now nut. The hurrying of the comet is
illustrated by the enlargement of the head. The

i iilengn. May 16. Astronomers of
Chicago and vicinity, who have lost
much sleep studying Halley's comet
since its appearance this year, do not
,'speak of its influence will in any way
be injurious on the earth.
"There cell be but little danger that
the tail of this celestial visitor, being
some 50,000,000 miles wide, will sweep
over the earth, but we will not even
feel it," said Mr. H. J. McLaughlin, as
tronomer at Depauw university today.
"None of the gases of the comet will
come closer than, say 10,000,000 miles of the
earth. At that distance the earth's atmosphere is much more
dense than the tail of the comet. Friction with
the atmosphere would destroy it at that altitude.
"As for cyanogen gas, that is must
lie around the head of the comet although the sun's repulsion and the
speed of the heavenly traveler may
have forced some of it into the tail."

The word comet is derived from the
I.aiin word coma, meaning hair
tramp and vagrants of the skies. Many of them come to
us from the depths of space, miss

through our solar system, and out of
it again, nevermore to return to us.
others again by the attraction of the
sun and the planets, are bent from
their course, and once e.-ipttirpd by
the iron law of gravitation they be
come permanent members of the
system and move round the sun in
orbits more or less eccentric. To the
former class I clonus the comet that is
now with ten-Hie sliced a pprnachini;
the earth the comet called "Halley's
comet." This now famous comet has
been identified as having appeared
eighteen times since the year 1305.
The comet has a period of 76
years, and its orbit reaches far
out beyond the outermost edge of the
solar system, far beyond the planet
Neptune. The comet obtained its
name in 1758, Halley observed
the comet on its appearance in
1682. He then set himself to the
manic task of calculating its period.
Tun iiiu it to k 1.. 1i' 1!. i', and fixing
its period at 76 years, he staked his
professional reputation that the comet
would return in the year 1758. In these
memorable words: "Wherefore if it
should return, according to my prediction, in the year 1758, impartial
posterity will not refuse to ascribe that prediction to all
the honor of a true prophecy."
Sure enough the comet appeared on Christmas day, 1758, and
thin it has been known as "Halley's comet."
A comet consists of a brilliant nu
cleus or head, which extends back
with the tail or train.

The head has all undetermined !

amount of solidity. The tail consists
of a swarm of solid particles of un
known size. These particles are sur
rounded by gaseous envelopes, and
the special light of the comet is pro
duced by electrical discharges between
the particles the solar beams doe to

the influence of the sun. The solid

particles of which the tail is composed
must be widely distributed because the
faintest stars may be seen through the train. Some astronomer has
called a comet "an illuminated sand-
bank." .
The close approach of Halley's
"comet to the earth upon this visit
raises the question How would it be possible for a comet to
hurt us'.' If there should be a head-
on collision between the earth and
the more or less solid head of a comet.
it would doubtless mean disaster to
the earth and the inhabitants thereof. If a
comet should fall into the sun it
would depend upon the amount of
solid matter in the body whether the
temperature of the sun would be
raised sufficiently to injure us. There
remains the third possibility of disaster, viz: The earth passing through
the tail of a comet, and as a matter of
fact the earth will probably pass
through the tail of Halley's comet
Wednesday or Thursday of this week,
Comet's streamers are always turned
away from the sun. About the 18th
of May, probably the stream of the comet is some 12,
million miles in length it will intersect
the path of the earth and we

shall dash through it. We do

dishu.'ii ion toll, need on the possibility
of certain conditions that might attract all repu idi' a us of the senate.

opinion that the difficulties between

The sudden inal;aas and "u of in
suikenls and regulars of the senate
last Tuesday, which resulted in the
adoption of an amendment to the a.il
111 1 nil ft a I toll bill appeared to
have made the regulars more tolerant
of the insurgents' views on the tariff.
The meeting time here was
necessitated by the discovery that the
insurgents had formed a solid front to
oppose the adoption of a bill to regulate
lone and short hauls, which had been in
contemplation by the regulars for some
time. The insurgents had voted with the
regulars in public but had been working
in secret to defeat the bill by the
insurgents.
It would be difficult to
whether the regulars or insurgents
were the more satisfied with the
result. A vote had been ordered under, in
the usual consent agreement, and
there was little time for deliberation.
