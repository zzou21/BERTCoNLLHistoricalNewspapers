TITLE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN: FRIDAY MORNING, MARCH 24, 1893.

THE PIANO AND THE PLAYER.
How rich was the blended sweetness
That flowed from the silent keys
At the touch of the gentle fingers
That moved with queenly ease
The hearers strangely wondered
When the royal sounds could come;
For without the gifted player
Too the notes had been mute and dumb.
But at her touch there was music
And harmony, till the soul
Was borne by the rising pinions
Where the songs of glory roll.
It was not the piano only;
It was not the moving keys.
It was all in the young musician
Her fingers all came from these.
And yet the cold notes could needed,
And all that was hid within:
'Twas not only the player's fingers
They could not the sweetness win,
If there had not been sweet responses
And yielding to her touch,
So the instrument needed playing,
And she needed it as much.
Alone we are mute and silent;
But if the great Master's hand
Is laid on the idle keyboard,
What music may cheer the land!
The praise must be all the player's,
Submission must be our part.
And His skill will get blended sweetness
From every yielded heart.
William Hull, In Golden Days.

ON APPROVAL.
Why Lady Loddington Is Civil to a
Common Man.
"What on earth do you call that thing?"
I asked, poking with my stick at a
bunch of grapes poised airily upon a
brass stand.
"That thing," replied my cousin,
proudly, "is the very latest Parisian
fashion in bonnets."
I sank back into the little lounge
that ran along the side of the room
(you couldn't insult anything so dainty
with the name of "shop") and gazed
upon its owner with an exclamation
more profane than appropriate.
It must at once be confessed that she
was a charming object to gaze at.
There was an expression of wicked
amusement in her large gray eyes,
and the black gown she still wore in
mourning for her husband (poor Jack
Henderson, who was killed in the
Sudan) set off the lines of her slender
young figure and threw her golden
hair and fair skin prettily into relief.
"Pull yourself together, my dear
boy," she continued, opening the door
of an old carved oak cabinet, "and I
will show you something that even
your crude male intellect will appreciate. If you don't say it's lovely I'll
never let you inside the shop again.
You may flatten your nose against the
window or stroll disconsolately up and
down the street in vain. No more
chats, no more teas in the back room,
Ronald."
So saying, she lifted gingerly from
the shelf a large hat, and, placing it
upon her pretty head, turned triumphantly toward me.
It was lovely—quite lovely—a sort of
arrangement in amethyst velvet and
feathers to match. Being only a miserable and ignorant mate, of course I
can't describe it; but it was uncommonly becoming and made Nina look
like a Gainsborough picture. I told
her so and gushed over it sufficiently
to satisfy her.
"It's my own idea, shape, and all, and
there isn't another like it in the world.
I may possibly copy it, but I'm not
sure. It depends upon who buys it."
"How I wish you were a woman, Ronald!"
she sighed, regretfully. "I would
make you buy it for Ascot to-morrow."
"I wish I were, my dear. But why
don't you go and wear it yourself?"
"Gracious! and leave the shop for a
whole day at this early stage of its existence! You guardsmen have no more
idea of business than a baby. No, I
can't go; but I hope you'll have a lucky
day and a good time, and Ronald, dear,
if you were nice you'd just look in one
day soon and tell me what sort of day
you had. Oh, and be sure you don't
forget to notice what hats and bonnets
people wear."
I promised to do my best and took
my leave reluctantly as a large and
portly matron, gorgeously arrayed,
and whose features unmistakably betrayed her Semitic origin, sailed in and
demanded a small "flower bonnet."
That woman in a flower bonnet! I
hope, poor soul, that Nina saved her
from herself.
"What are you going to do this afternoon, Ronald?" asked my mother three
days later. "I wish you to come and
call with me on the Vanderdeckens."
"Can't, my dear mother. Promised
to go and see Nina."
Visions of Miss Vanderdecken, rich
as Croesus, but oh, so deadly dull! hastened my movements, and I was half
way to Oxford street before my mother
could call me back. I found Mine.
Destrier, as my cousin calls herself, just parting with a customer. The
hat was in her hand.
"I've sold it," she cried, gleefully;
"just sold it to that nice girl for five
guineas."
"Awful glad, I'm sure. But, my
dear girl, I've a shock in store for you.
I saw the very model and marrow of
that hat at Ascot the day before yesterday."
"You couldn't, you couldn't! Who
was wearing it?" she cried, sharply.
"One of our reigning professional
beauties—Lady Loddington!"
"Lady Loddington!" gasped Nina,
catching hold of the chair behind her.
"Ronald, are you sure you aren't making
any mistake?"
"I swear I'm not. She had on a frock
the color of the hat, and she looked
simply ripping. I paid her all the compliments I could think of in the five
minutes I was talking to her."
"The cheat, the swindle of it!" cried
my cousin, white with anger.
"My dear girl, calm yourself! I'm
sorry for you, but great minds, as you
know, will jump, and some other clever
woman has had the same idea as you.
Our sentiments, madam, are mine
if I don't think they should be wasted
on the fact that some other woman has
made a hat like yours."
"She hasn't!" cried Nina, indignant.
"But Lady Loddington was wearing
this very hat. Listen, I'll tell you
the whole story. The same afternoon
I'm called a lady came in beautifully
dressed and asked to see some hats. I
saw who she was, though I've never
met her. I don't want to meet her,"
savagely; "One sees quite enough of
her in all the shop windows."
"One does," I remarked, sotto voce.
"She wanted a hat the color of this
one, so I brought it out and showed it
to her and told her the price and explained why it was so expensive. 'Oh,
I don't mind giving that for the hat,'
she said; 'it is well worth it. I am
quite in love with it, Mme. Destrier,
but I dare not buy it without letting
my husband see it. He is so very particular about what I wear. Could I
have it sent round to-night for him to
look at? I would let you know some
time to-morrow whether I would take
it or not.' Of course I said I should be
glad to send it, and she gave me the
address, and the hat went round there
that evening. Last night she sent it
back and said she was very sorry, but
Lord Loddington didn't think it suited
her. I thought it looked a little tumbled, but one has to run those risks
when one sends goods on approval.
She had determined to have that hat
just to wear for the one day, and she
was too mean to get it honestly."
Of course you'll have it out with
her—you'll expose her?" I said.
I was as angry and disgusted as Nina,
who stood opposite me, with her pretty
eyes and cheeks flaming with honest
indignation.
"My dear boy, I would if I dared, but
I can't afford to. It would drive half
my customers away from me, and I
must think of Hugo and Giles. They
don't cost much while they are twins,
but I want to give them every advantage, the darlings, and I was left so
badly off, and the business is just beginning to pay so well. I dare not run
the risk of exposing Lady Loddington's
meanness."
"I had forgotten your children. No,
it would not do. Trust me to give
her a mauvais quart d'heure, if I get
the chance."
"Promise you'll be careful. Think of
the little boys."
"I won't injure the dear chaps, you
best of mothers."
"Well, in that case, I only hope for
tune may favor you."
Fortune did favor me at last, but she
kept me waiting till the autumn, like
the fickle jade she always is. My
chance came in this wise: My uncle
asked me up to his place in Scotland
for shooting, and I went. The old gentleman is a very connoisseur of beauty,
and every pretty woman of note is
bound to be asked up to D sooner
or later. I got there in time to dress
hurriedly and appear in the drawing
room just as my uncle was telling
everyone whom he was to take in. I
was introduced to some girl I have
not a notion who she was, but I gave
her my arm and took her down to dinner, murmuring commonplaces on
the way. The truth is, I was half famished with my journey, and my one
idea was dinner. It was not until I
was well on with the fish stage that I
looked at my left-hand neighbor. It
was Lady Loddington herself.
"I haven't seen you since we met at
Ascot," she remarked, pleasantly.
She certainly is a most lovely woman, by the way. I stared blankly, and
she went on with an air of well-acted
reproach:
"I believe you have forgotten we
ever met there."
Here was my chance; I seized it.
"Forgotten! Why, I remember every
word you said, the color of your gown
and even the very hat you wore—the
loveliest and most becoming hat I ever
saw in my life."
The compliment told.
"I don't believe you do," she pouted.
"Upon my word I do. It was a sort
of big affair of amethyst velvet, and
feathers to match. I remember it with
double force because I made a cousin
of mine quite angry with the mere description of it. I don't know if you
ever met her? She has gone into
millinery, like everybody else. She
calls herself 'Mme. Destrier.' "
I looked Lady Loddington full in the
face and laid a peculiar emphasis on
the name. I never saw anyone so
thoroughly caught in my life. I saw
in a moment that she knew I knew.
She turned perfectly scarlet to the
roots of her hair, and then quite white,
and didn't speak for at least a moment.
Then she pulled herself together, as
only a woman can, and adroitly
changed the subject. But she has
been very civil to me ever since, much
to my surprise or my menuis. I am
plain and uninteresting; I am not a
personage; I haven't a farthing—not
even expectations—and they can't
make out where the attraction lies.
They had better ask Mme. Destrier, of
Oxford street, to enlighten them.
London Paper.
Nobody Laughed the Joke.
"One of the coolest actions I ever observed in the course of my express experience," said an express messenger,
"was that of a rough fellow from New
Mexico. He was poorly dressed, and
boarded our train at Tombstone on a
second-class ticket, depositing at the
same time a box in the cave of the express agent, labeled: 'Rattlesnake
handle with care.' It was a small soap
box, and not very heavy, but you can
bet that box was zealously guarded.
At Kansas City he came and got the
box and carried it off to a bank. The
banker was a friend of mine, and,
meeting him the next day, I asked
what that fellow did in the bank with
the rattlesnakes.
"Rattlesnakes! Well, that's a good
joke on the express company," he
replied. "That box had eighty thousand
dollars in ten-dollar greenbacks in it,
"If the money had been entered as
money we would have charged him a
neat sum for its transportation, but by
labeling it rattlesnakes he had it carried for
a trifle and I'll venture it was more
secure from robbers under that simple
title than it would have been in the
stoutest safe." Cincinnati Times-Star.
Recognized the Symptom. "I think
Charlie Tonsill is very nice," she said.
"You ought to hear him sing: 'Some
Day.' "
"Hello!" ejaculated her brother. "Has
Charley been borrowing money from
you, too?" Puck.

EMERGENCY.
How a Midshipman's Wit Got Him Out
of Serious Trouble.
On board a man-of-war bound home
from China was a young midshipman
named Jones, says the Detroit Free
Press. He was a favorite with the officers, and had in him the talent for the
making of a fine officer.
The midshipmen on board stood their
watch forward, and every hour it was
their duty to come aft and write up the
weather columns of the ship's log,
showing the readings of the barometer,
thermometer and to heave the chip log
for her speed.
The captain, in company with the officer of the deck, was walking the
weather side of the poop deck conversing when Midshipman Jones came aft
to write up the log.
The barometer, a mercurial one, was
lying in the captain's cabin, and Jones,
after having read it, helped himself liberally to the captain's sherry on the
cabin sideboard.
In walking the poop
the captain happened to glance down
the cabin flight and saw the mid-
shipman leaving the log. The captain addressed him
as follows:
"How is the barometer, sir?"
Jones hesitated and said: "Steadily
rising, sir; steadily rising."
The captain then asked: "And how
is the decanter, sir?"
Jones was taken aback, but with a
steady voice replied: "Steadily falling,
sir; steadily falling."
This reply was too much for the captain, and, bursting out laughing, he said:
"Young man, your reply has saved
you from punishment; but it is a long
way to 'Frisco, so hereafter I beg of
you not to consult the decanter as often
as you do the barometer."
