in Work of Organization.

With Mrs. Louise Stevens Cooke
acting in the capacity of local rep
resentative, a chapter of the Ameri
can Woman's League will be formed
in Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon next
at the home of Mrs. G. K. Donnelly, 43
Portland place. Already a good mem
bership is assured and it is likely that
with the impetus given the work of
the public, a chapter house may be
erected in Phoenix within the near
future.
Not alone is Mrs. Cooke engaged in
forming chapters in Phoenix but she

has also been authorized to undertake
the work of forming other chapters in

It has branches in nearly a thousand
villages, towns and cities throughout
America, where beautiful local chapter
or club houses are being erected to

become the local center of education,

the arts, opportunity and

municipal improvement. From the
central institutions, at whose heads
are famous artists, sculptors, masters
and teachers, drawn from the best in
this country and Europe, the courses
of instruction are sent to the members
in their own homes by correspondence.
Honor courses of personal
attendance under salary at University
City are provided for those who de
velop a high order of talent, ability
or genius.
In the local chapter houses, in addi
tion to their social use as beautiful
club houses for women, are conducted
classes, formed among the members,
in the various arts and crafts, coached
and assisted by the graduate honor
students, who must give four months
as teachers after graduation from the
league's university and academy of
fine arts.
Mrs. Cooke for many years was en
gaged in educational work in the east,
being a teacher for the New York board
of education.

The plan and purpose of the American
Woman's league centers about its

Fortune Telling

Does not take into consideration the one essential to wom
an's happiness — womanly health.
The woman who neglects her health is neglecting the
very foundation of all good fortune. For without health
love loses its lustre and gold is but dross.
Womanly health when lost or impaired may generally be
regained by the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.
This Prescription has, for over 40 years,
been curing delicate, weak, pain-wracked
women, by the hundreds of thousands,
and this too in the privacy of their homes
without their having to submit to indeli
cate questionings and offensively repug
nant examinations.
Sick women are invited to consult Dr. Pierce by letter free.

All correspondence held as sacredly confidential. Address World's Dispensary
Medical Association, R. V. Pierce, M. D., President, Buffalo, N. Y.
Dr. Pierce's Great Family Doctor Book, The People's Common Sense
Medical Adviser, newly revised up-to-date edition 1001 pages, answers in
Plain English hundreds of delicate questions which every woman, single or married,
ought to know about. Sent free, in plain wrapper to any address on receipt of

stenography, etc.
The league's university, art schools
and business courses, together with
the honor courses, are open to every
member and her minor children free.
The local chapter house becomes a
branch of the Central University and
Academy of Fine Arts, where its
members may study in classes those
courses in art and other higher educa
tion which would otherwise only be
available at great expense by personal
attendance in some great metropolis.
This whole plan and organization,
now spread in over eight hundred
chapters and tens of thousands of
members throughout the nation, is
founded on a simple, self-respecting,
sound business, self-supporting basis,
which in itself is the greatest possible
educational influence the wider
spread of good literature and useful
information in the shape of standard
and well-known magazines and jour
nals of the best class. Each publisher
listed by the league gives towards the
support of its institutions and the
erection and maintenance of its chap
ter houses, one-half of the subscription
income of his journal derived
through the organization, together
with liberal space in its columns for
the use of the league. The subscription
business of these well-known
journals is thereby being lifted from
a former basis of prizes, premiums
and schemes to the high plane of
grand, artistic and educational move
ment. Opening to tens of thousands of
homes, advantages, and opportunities
which would otherwise be impossible
to obtain, and in place of subscription
premiums, prizes and schemes,
the vast sum formerly so spent, now
under the league plan, becomes a per
manent yearly income for the main
tenance of splendid institutions for
the use and benefit of their readers.
There is nothing in the league plan
which appeals to anything but the de
sire for culture, refinement, education,
and civic improvement and a
wider opportunity for women. It is
not a charity or philanthropy, but a
simple business co-operation through
which the league, acting as a great
permanent national subscription or
ganization, renders a valuable service
to publishers and receives in return a
vast permanent income in which every
member is an equal life-long beneficiary.
Its form is that of a trustee
ship, all income being administered and
all property held in trust by a board
of trustees for the equal life long ben
efit and service of every person em
ploying with the simple requirement of
membership. It is not a secret society,
has no dues or assessments, but its
membership is an open door to the
highest self culture and opportunity.
Although but a year old, the league's
income has already reached the vast
sum of more than a million and a half
dollars per year: the payroll alone of
the famous masters, artists and
teachers at the head of its university
and art courses, exceeds $100,000 per
annum. Thousands of members are
enrolled in its classes, while its great
central buildings and beautiful local
chapter houses constitute a national
university in the highest sense. It is
rapidly elevating the best in American
womanhood and is the only self-support-
ing, hence self-respecting, inde
pendent organization of women gaining
all that it receives through sound
business principles, in place of former
methods of political social highwayman
ship, such as bazaars, fetes, etc. For
every dollar of its income a full con
complete return is at once given in
the best magazines and journals pub
lished, at their regular prices, of
which the league receives one-half for
the sales service rendered the publisher,
and the publisher the other
half for his publication.
The average expenditure for maga
zines and Journals of general circula
tion is estimated at one dollar per in
habitant. Under former methods the
publisher expended the greater part of
that dollar in premiums, prizes and commissions. Under
the league plan he pays half the dollar into the league's funds, while the
circulation of his magazine is im
mensely increased through the organ
ized national sales force of the
league's membership. A careful record
for months past has shown that fully
75 per cent of the subscription business
of the league has been new business
for the publisher: new readers for his
publications, a powerful new force in
the spread of good literature.
No grander, higher mission could be
conceived than that of the American
Woman's league, and no greater service
could be rendered than that which
its members enjoy. It places in the
reach of every woman and her family
the best in education, culture, self
advancement and a wider opportunity
in her home, giving her the independ
ence, protection, assistance and ad
vantage of a rich and powerful na
tional organization, great educational
institutions and beautiful local club
houses, backed by the power of a
great press. Yet it is all her own,
created by her own effort and con
trolled by her own vote. Each member
retains to each the counties and enjoys the benefit of membership for
life.

All aboard for the following Hotels, Summer Resorts, etc. You can wear
golf, bowl, dance or lose yourself among shady nooks and quiet retreats,
