UNDERWRITERS
HAVE BANQUET

Stockholders of Arizona &
New Mexico Company
Hold Annual Meeting and
Elect Officers in Phoenix
Yesterday.
The annual stockholders' meeting of
the Arizona & New Mexico Underwriters
company was held in this city yesterday, and
an elaborate banquet, served in the still rooms
of the Hotel Adams, followed.
Members of the company from all
points of the southwest were in at-
tendance and the success of both the
meeting and banquet was all that
could be desired.
The company has the general agency
in Arizona and New Mexico for the
Kansas City Life Insurance company
of San Francisco, California, recently
consolidated with the Golden State Life
Insurance Company of Los Angeles,
which makes the organization one
of the largest in the west. Hurt and
Crozier, the managers and organizers
of the Arizona & New Mexico Underwriters
company, represented the Golden
State Life Insurance company for
some time, and placed a vast amount
of insurance on the books.
The company also holds a general
agency for Arizona and New Mexico
for the Frankfort Marine, Accident and
Plate Glass Insurance company, the
largest accident insurance company in
the world, as well as valuable contracts
with other large companies for the
writing of various lines of insurance.
By having the strong directory board
that this company has, and by holding
such valuable contracts, it is able to
bring thousands of dollars into Arizona
to help develop her great resources.
The companies which the Arizona
& New Mexico Underwriters company
represents are furnishing them a vast
amount of money to be placed in Arizona
and New Mexico; besides they
are influencing money from many other
sources.
The following officers and directors
were elected at the meeting:
Mr. R.L. Balke, president; Mr. W.
L. Hurt, first vice-president; Mr. C.H.
Tinker, second vice-president; Mr. J.
A. Crozier, secretary and treasurer;
Mr. Blaine Rowman, assistant secretary
and assistant treasurer.

R.L. Balke Indian Trading Company,
Phoenix, Ariz.; Mr. W.L. Hurt, of
Hurt & Crozier, Phoenix, Ariz.; Mr. C.H.
Tinker, cashier Glendale State Bank,
Glendale, Ariz.; Mr. J.A. Crozier,

master of the evening. Mr. Hurt

GREEDY FLIES
Historic Hotel Goes Down
Fire Still Beyond Control
and Spreading Rapidly at Three O'clock
This Morning.
Associated Press Dispatch
BOSTON, Jan. 16. The Hotel Revere
took fire shortly before two this
morning. The fire started in the dining
room on the street floor, and
quickly spread through the six stories.
Many guests were carried down ladders
by firemen and others rushed
from the building through smoke.
From the Revere House the fire
spread to the Hall of the National
Firemen, then to the house of engine
company No. 4. The Hotel Oxford,
another of the older hostelries,
is in danger and the guests have been
ordered out. One fireman is dead.
Police who entered the hotel to rescue
guests were driven back by the
dense smoke. They declare dozens of
people were still in the building and
many must be dead.
Four alarms called out the greater
portion of the city's fighting apparatus,
and the firemen were able, by
strenuous effort, to save the hall
and engine house. A sudden shift of
wind sent the blaze around the main
part of the hotel and the building
appeared doomed. The fireman who
was killed, fell from the fourth floor
and landed on a picket fence. Confirmation
of the number of dead in
the hotel is lacking. A party of sailors
from warships in the harbor did
excellent work. At three this morning
the fire is still beyond control.
The Revere was a famous hotel. It
was built in 1847, and was the most
sumptuous hotel Boston contained at
that time.

The Americans in Berlin read with
much interest the "American Notes"
which a local paper is publishing,
writes a New Yorker from that city.
"The observant note writer makes a
great fuss about the 'practical handling
of baggage and devotes much
space to a full description of the
check system a convenience which we
at home do not appreciate. Among
the queer things under the head of
'Customs' he says: 'In New York
you may wear your hat anywhere.
No one thinks of removing it in a
place or business, but woe unto him
who keeps his head covered in an
elevator if a woman happens to be a
passenger. On the street, when you
meet a man whom you know you
need not remove your hat in salutation.
You say 'Hello, Billy,' and he
responds 'Hello, Fritz,' and both rush
on too busy to say more.'"

STRIKES USED
TO PRESERVE ORDER
Striking Woolen and Cotton Workers
Engage in Wholesale Riots
in City of Lawrence.
Associated Press Dispatch
LAWRENCE, Jan. 15. Right companies
of militia including a field battery
have been placed in the mill district
in this city and martial law prevails
tonight after a day of rioting
caused by the strike of 15,000 mill operatives.
At least 10,000 other hands
of the cotton and woolen mills have
been thrown out of work. In one
instance the militia had to charge the
mob with fixed bayonets, and one boy
was probably fatally hurt. Thirty
arrests of armed rioters were made
during the day and a few strikers and
mill employees were treated for bullet
wounds. The majority of the mills
expected to open in the morning and the
militia has been instructed to use drastic
measures to prevent a repetition of
today's events. The mills are expected
to run only with a reduced force as
the strikers have trebled their numbers
since Friday.
It was agreed at a conference by
strike leaders and city officials, that
the strikers will be allowed to place
pickets about the approaches to the
mill with the understanding that signs
of violence on their part will be cause
for arrests. At a special session of
court tonight rioters were found guilty:
three were sentenced to two years
in the house of correction and the
others to one year. The strikers voted
tonight to stand by their demands for
an increase in pay, and other concessions.
Mayor Scanlon ordered all saloons
to remain closed tomorrow.

A FINE WINDOW. The window of
the Wright B. Heard realty agency is
attracting a great deal of attention
these days. The feature of it is a
group of pictures reproduced by a
three-color half-tone process from a
collection of about twenty famous
paintings of Arizona scenes by Maxfield
Parrish. Parrish, who is one of
the greatest colorists among American
illustrators, was here and at the Grand
Canyon in 1902 when the original pictures
were made. These reproductions
include a picture of Camelback mountain
from its eastern end, a scene on
the old Grand Canal, pasture and cowboy
and desert pictures. The rest of
the window is devoted to a citrus display,
including grapefruit from the
LeBours (Clayson) orchard, and blood
and navel oranges, tangerines and sour
seedlings from the Ward grove. The
foliage on the branches to which the
fruit clings should dispel by its freshness
and greenness any fear that one
might have that the recent frosts were
of serious effect.

IT GROWS DAILY. Work on the
federal building is now well under way.
The concrete foundations are in and
the brick walls have been started. The
steel frame in the center of the building
is now in course of erection.

Noted Desperado Captured by Sheriff
After Chase Which has Lasted
Since Last November.
Associated Press Dispatch
REDDING, Jan. 15. Indian Mike
Harami with his son, killed Deputy Constable
William M. Balke and wounded
Constable Kchvard Ionising, in Fall City,
in November, were captured tonight at
Lovelock, Nevada. Sheriff Hunsacker
ran down the murderer and telegraphed
the Sheriff of Shasta county
he expected to have the renegade's son
in a few hours. He has been on the
trail continuously since the murder.
RENO, Jan. 15. Wilson Harami, son
of Mike Harami, known as Indian Mike,
was captured tonight in Lovelock by
Constable Wolf. The younger Indian
outlaw of 20, is deaf, dumb and almost
blind. He surrendered at the command
of his father, who was brought to his
hiding place handcuffed. The capture
of Mike earlier in the day resulted
from his recognition by Jailor Hardesty,
formerly of Shasta county. Mike
admitted his identity and said when
Balke was shot, the officers fired the
first shot that took off the boy's nose.

"UNDER WESTERN EYES."
Joseph Conrad's new novel, "Under
Western Eyes," is the drama of a
man's conscience. It is done throughout
with that extraordinary power,
that wonderful mingling of outward
reality with inward feeling, which are
characteristic of this author at his
best. The novel has just been published
by the Harpers.
The people of the story are Russian
for the most part, and the title,
"Under Western Eyes," expresses the
fact that the revelations of temperament
which the tale involves must
seem very strange to the people of
Western lands. Joseph Conrad, who
is himself a native of Russia, thoroughly
understands the Russian
nature, its essential humanity, its
depths of contradiction, and its spiritual
force.
The central figure is a young student
at the University of St. Petersburg
named Razumov. He is of a
reserved nature and has little in
common with most of his fellows,
but on account of his philosophical
views, he is thought to have revolutionary
sympathies. As a matter
of fact, his tendencies are all in the
opposite direction. He is really the
illegitimate son of a powerful nobleman,
Prince K., who, although he
never explicitly acknowledges the relation,
in an indirect way promises
him advancement. Just as Razumov's
hopes are becoming definite, a much-
hated minister of state is assassinated.
Returning from his interview
with the prince, he finds that the
assassin, Haldin, a fellow-student, has
taken refuge in his rooms. The situation
is intolerable, for Razumov
knows that the least suspicion of

tempts will ruin him. He hates
Haldin for his naivete, his trustfulness, his
innocent talk of high impulses. He
is in an agony of mind, while the assassin
himself, fired up by a great
moral conviction, can sleep peacefully.
The temptation is that, on pre-
tence of arranging for an escape, he
entraps Haldin to the police. Then
Razumov himself comes under suspicion
and he is subjected to a very
subtle sort of third-degree treatment.
After a period of observation the
authorities decide that he is a fit
instrument for their purposes and
send him to Geneva as a police spy.
Here he meets and, in spite of himself,
falls in love with Haldin's sister.
Confession trembles upon his
lips at all times. With superhuman
self-control he seems to stand apart
and criticize each of his own utterances.
Every act is a conscious effort
of will. Joseph Conrad portrays
this waking nightmare with extraordinary
power, yet the human note
is felt in it all.
"Under Western Eyes" is a novel
in which a really big theme is handled
by a writer of genius.

It is reported that Alexander V.
Moore, one of the best-known men
in political circles in western Pennsylvania,
is considering matrimony.
The lady mentioned in the case is
the beautiful Miss Lillian Russell.
Mr. Moore is the publisher of the
Pittsburgh Leader and Miss Russell
also dispenses advice on how to look
good, though an ugly duckling, by
medium of newspaper columns.
Those who are in a position to
know whereof they speak declare that
the democratic national convention,
wherever it meets, will last much
longer than that of the republicans.
There is to be a terrific struggle
over platforms in the democratic convention.
An attempt will be made
to arrange every detail of the platform
so that it will be an eloquent
argument over the platform of the
republicans in its promises to the
people. Up to the present time there are
twelve democratic presidential possibilities.
They are Harmon, Wilson,
Champ Clark, Gov. Marshall of Indiana,
Gov. Dix of New York, Gov.
Foss of Massachusetts, Gov. Baldwin
of Connecticut, ex-Gov. Folk of Missouri,
William J. Bryan, William R.
Hearst, Representative Underwood of
Alabama and Mayor Gaynor of New
York city. The most conspicuous Republican
candidates are Taft, Roosevelt
and La Follette, although Col.
Roosevelt persistently denies that he
intends re-entering politics.
