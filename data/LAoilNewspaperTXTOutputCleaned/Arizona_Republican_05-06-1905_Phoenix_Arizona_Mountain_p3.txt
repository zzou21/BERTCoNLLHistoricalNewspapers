If more than ordinary skill in playing brings the honors of the
game to the winning player, so exceptional merit in a remedy
ensures the commendation of the well informed, and as a reason
able amount of outdoor life and recreation is conducive to the
health and strength, so does a perfect laxative tend to one's
improvement in cases of constipation, biliousness, headaches,
etc. It is all-important, however, in selecting a laxative, to
choose one of known quality and excellence, like the ever pleasant
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the California Fig Syrup
Co., a laxative which sweetens and cleanses the system effect
ually, when a laxative is needed, without any unpleasant after
effects, as it acts naturally and gently on the internal organs,
simply assisting nature when nature needs assistance, without
griping, irritating, or debilitating the internal organs in any way,
as it contains nothing of an objectionable or injurious nature.
As the plants which are combined with the figs in the manu
facture of Syrup of Figs are known to physicians to act most
beneficially upon the system, the remedy has met with their
general approval as a family laxative, a fact well worth con
sidering in making purchases.
It is because of the fact that SYRUP OF FIGS
is a remedy of known quality and excellence, and approved by
physicians that has led to its use by so many millions of well
informed people, who would not use any remedy of uncertain
quality or inferior reputation. Every family should have a
bottle of the genuine on hand at all times, to use when a
laxative remedy is required. Please to remember that the
genuine Syrup of Figs is for sale in bottles of one size

only, by all reputable druggists and that full name of the
company California Fig Syrup Co., is plainly printed on
the front of every package. Regular price, 50c per bottle.

FOUGHT IT OUT
Continued From Page 1.
stage the fight was about even, if any
thing, Britt having a slight lead.
Round 10. Britt missed a left swing
for the head and a right for White's
face was also blocked. White jabbed
a straight left to the face for which
Jimmy countered with a left hook to
the face. They swung themselves in
to a clinch and Britt sent in a raking
right to the jaw and a left swing to the
head. White got back at him however
with a straight jab to the face. Britt's
blows seemed to excel in power those
of his adversary. Both missed several
leads with straight lefts for the face
and they fought to a clinch. White
then sent his left to the face, bring
ing blood from a gash over Jimmy's
eye. Britt then sent in a tremendous
slash to the Britisher's jaw, which
forced him to cover quickly and the
bell rang. There was a cut over Britt's
eye from which blood trickled in a tiny
stream as the Californian sought his
corner. Round was an even one.
Round 11. They quickly rushed to
a clinch and indulged in some infight
ing, neither landing. Britt was wild
with a left and then a moment later
hooked twice to White's jaw with the
left. There was a momentary lull in
the fighting and then Britt landed his
left on the jaw and a left hook lightly
to the body. Britt continued as the
aggressor but White never broke
ground. A clever exhibition of duck
ing and blocking vicious swings was
again in evidence and the crowd was
much pleased. Britt swung a left
thrice for the jaw, but was blocked
and White's efforts at a counter were
also blocked. White was bleeding
slightly from the mouth when he took
his seat and Britt's eye looked very
bad indeed. Britt's blows on the body
were the only ones that seemed to
puzzle White.
Round 12. Britt at once shot his
left to the stomach. They sparred and
White sent Britt to the floor, with a
straight to the face. Britt was off his
balance, however, as the blow landed and
the delivery was not clean. Britt was
up quickly and fought as though noth
ing had happened. He realized very
soon, that he was in a fight for White
clouted him viciously on the jaw with
a right hook and Britt fought back
hard. In a mix both exchanged rights
to the face. Britt missed two vicious
lefts for the jaw as the bell rang.
White had the advantage in the round
and the crowd yelled "White, White,"
etc., while the men went to their
seats.
Round 13. They both mixed lefts for
the face and Britt suddenly shot two
lefts to the face and a moment later
hooked the left to White's jaw. Britt
sent White's head back with two lefts
to the face straight and followed it
with a left hook to the body. Britt
then got in another left to the body
and a clinch ensued. Britt swung a
vicious left to the head and jabbed
White with a left to the face. Then
Britt sent in a stiff left hook to White's
stomach and followed his advantage
with a right and left swing to the jaw.
A right shift caught White on the face
and then a left hook to the body found
a berth as the bell rang. Britt's show
ing in this round was the best of the
contest. He landed innumerable lefts
to the stomach and jaw, but they lack
ed the force necessary to bring distress
to his opponent.
Round 14. White cleverly ducked
Britt's attempts with the left and right
for the head but an instant later Jimmy
swung his right and left to the jaw
and the latter sought cover. White
jabbed twice with a left to the face and
Britt landed a fearful right into the
body and then outboxing his shifty
opponent landed three left hooks to the
jaw and then a left hook to the body.
Britt continued to deal out the damag
ing punishment, sending two lefts to
White's stomach and a right to the
head. Britt kept pegging away, land
ing almost at will. As the round closed
Britt swung his left hard to the face.
It was all Britt's round but the Eng
lishman took his punishment without
wincing. Britt appeared to have im
proved in his speed and White found
it harder to block Britt's onslaughts.
Round 15. Britt missed a left for
the body twice and two left attempts
for the jaw were blocked. Britt con
tinued to do all the leading. White
still contenting himself with defensive
work. Britt missed a left for the bo
dy and then crossed a left for White's
face and then uppercut with a left to
the body. They mixed it continually
and Britt planted a short arm left to
White's jaw and blocked all attempts
of the Englishman to counter. Britt
then worked his left to the body and
hooked a left to the jaw. Britt was
landing with monotonous regularity
but his blows did not seem to faze
the Englishman to any appreciable ex
tent.
Round 16. They went to a clinch.
Britt forced the fighting leading out
with either left or right. A straight left
found the Britisher's head. An attempt
at retaliation went a glimmering. Britt
hooked two wicked lefts to the jaw and
quick as a flash drove a straight left
to the body and the Englishman cov
ered. Britt swung his left to the face
and Britt blocked White's encounters.
Britt shot his left to the body and then
sent a stiff left to the jaw. They went
to a clinch. Britt kept forcing the pace.
White merely acting on the defensive.
Britt again hooked his left to the sto
mach and the bell rang with all the
honors in the Californian's favor. At
this stage Britt appeared to hold a long
lead and has the decision won easily
unless White takes a brace. Britt has
done practically all the leading and
landed the cleaner blows.
Round 17. The usual opening clinch
followed. Britt missed twice with a
left for the face and head and attempts
by both with right and left swings went
wild. Finally Britt shot two lefts to
White's face and they went to a clinch.
Breaking away, Britt shot his left out
rather low and there was some hissing
from the gallery. Britt hooked his
unerring left to the body and then var
ied it with a straight right to the head.
White fought back rather feebly and
appeared to have lost all his steam.
Britt swung a hard left to the jaw
and then a crushing right caught White
on the jaw, nearly putting him out.
Britt was over anxious to put in a fin
ishing blow and his subsequent at
tempts were rather wild. He was cau
tioned by his seconds to fight care
fully. It was all Britt again, in this
round. White scarcely landing a blow.
Round 18. Britt rushed but failed to
land. A left hook for the body was
blocked and then both missed left and
right swings for the face. Emerging
from a clinch, Britt swung a left and
right to the jaw and an instant later
planted a vicious left hook to the body.
Britt got careless and White shot a
right hard to the face by way of a
diversion. Britt forced White around

and landed a left hook to body. White
was still on the defensive and the lat
ter did nothing but block, block, block,
which was growing monotonous to the
audience. Just before the round end
ed, Britt hooked his left to the face
and the Englishman slowly ambled to
his corner. Britt can't lose unless by
a knockout at the hands of White.
Round 19. Britt lunged out with the
left and was blocked. He kept forcing
the pace and missed a left and right
for the body. A similar attempt was
also barren and Britt rocked White's
head with a full right swing to the
chin. Britt missed a fearful left swing
and a right swing partially caught the
Britisher on the face. White kept
Britt busy leading, blocking most of
the Californian's attempts. One left
reached the Englishman's chin lightly
and then White tried left and right
twice for the face but his efforts were
unavailing. They went to the center
of the ring and exchanged right and
left swings as the bell denoted the
end of the round. This round was
very tame and tiresome with Britt
still in the lead.
Round 20 and last. They shook hands
and Britt immediately sailed in, miss
ing a left for the face. The pace
quickened, but the blows were easily
blocked. Both fought at close quar
ters, with White mostly on the defen
sive. Britt suddenly uncorked a vi
cious right on the body and in some
in-fighting failed to connect with left
and right for the jaw. Britt was
careful, realizing that apparently the
decision was his. The referee had to
separate the men from a clinch and
then Britt again put a right to the
body and brought his right and left
with a fearful force to White's jaw,
sending White tottering to the floor
very groggy. When the Britisher rose
Britt went at him like a demon and
sent him clear across the ring with
right and left smashes to the face. The
round was nearly over at this stage,
but the police jumped in the ring and
stopped the uneven contest and Britt
was declared the winner amid tremen
dous applause.
ANOTHER REFORM MOVE

A Plan to Throw Phoenix Into a Local
Option District.

It is given out on good authority that
a movement will shortly be set on foot
to throw this town into a local option
district. The city is already surround
ed by such a district whose irregular
inner boundary would be greatly dis
turbed if the movement should prove
successful.
This thing has been talked about ever
since the city election but little atten
tion was paid to it for the reason that
it seemed hopeless to secure the nec
essary two-thirds vote for the estab
lishment of local option in the city and
it was further erroneously supposed
that the local option law prevented the
joining of any outside territory to an
incorporated town for local option pur
poses. But it has been ascertained that that
can be done if the necessary votes can
be secured. The law provides that it
shall be the duty of the board of su
pervisors to order an election when
ever petitioned to do so by as many
as 350 voters in any county or by as
many as fifty in any justice's precinct
or subdivision of the county as the
board may designate or in any city or
town. But it is further provided that
if any precinct or subdivision em
braces within its limits any incorporat
ed city or town or portions thereof,
then the election shall be ordered only
on a petition signed by qualified voters
not less than one tenth in number of
the total vote cast for delegate to con
gress in the next preceding general
election by such incorporated city or
town. But in making sub-divisions for
local option purposes no city or town
shall be divided.
It is said to be the purpose of the
advocates of local option to establish
a district taking in everything on
the north side of the river, including
the strong temperance regions of
Scottsdale and the territory west of the
city where the temperance idea has al
ways been strong.
It would not be possible to secure
within the limits of Phoenix anywhere
near a majority in favor of local op
tion but it is figured by those who are
urging the matter along that the short
age of votes in the town would be much
more than made up in the surrounding
country. It has been stated that the
petition will be put in circulation
shortly.

BULLDOG PICKETT

Will Throw Steers With His Teeth at
Eastlake Park Today.

This is the day of the first steer
throwing entertainment by Bulldog
Pickett at Eastlake park under the
management of Jack Gibson. Besides
his turn there will be bronco riding to
break the monotony of the program
and a moral exhibition may be de
pended upon.
An effort was made a few days ago
to describe Bulldog Pickett's feat but
it was weakly pictured and since then
various persons who have seen him do
the trick have reported concerning its
genuineness though all disagree as to
just how he does it.
There is only one thing certain and
that is that he throws the steers with
his teeth and those who are curious to
know how it is done should go to the
park today and see for themselves. He
will throw three steers during the per
formance, if all plans carry but unless
he throws at least one as advertised
the management guarantees to refund
the money.

Have you seen Kelvin? Go next Sunday.

SMITH IS HOMESICK

A Frisco

Detective Will Reach St.
Louis Today

St. Louis, May 5. Upon the expected
arrival tomorrow of a detective from
San Francisco who will take back Ed
ward J. Smith, the San Francisco tax
collector, under arrest here on a charge
of embezzlement, it will be decided
whether Smith will immediately be
taken to California or whether the
start will be delayed until next week.
At the police headquarters it is
stated today that Smith is still anxious
to start at once, and he will be turned
over to the San Francisco detective upon the latter's arrival. It is
thought probable, however, that after
the long trip across the country the
San Francisco officer may desire to
rest until next week before returning
with his prisoner.
A message was received by Smith's
friends, that his wife is reported to be in
a more favorable condition. This news elicited expressions
of gratification from him.
