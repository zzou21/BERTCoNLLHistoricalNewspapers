Bellboy Now Looking For That Dixie Delegate—
Sidelights From San
Francisco

BY MAX STERN
N. E. A. Staff Correspondent.
SAN FRANCISCO, June 28.—Jim
mie Phelan, U. S. Senator from
California, is playing host to all the
big bugs of the convention at his
ranch down the peninsula. The sen
ator has spent a fortune fixing his
place up like a Roman villa and one
of the prides of his classic existence
there is the big out-of-doors baths,
just like the Roman senators
used to splash about in. The sena
tor has been advised not to hang his
toga too far away from the pool when
he takes a dip. for William Kent’s I
men plan a raid on it next Novem-I

The first piece of Confederate

for the Southern delegate who gave I
it to him for a tip.

Getting exclusive pictures of Democratic celebrities takes diplomacy
on the part of Staff Photographer MacDonald in San Francisco. Above,
left to right, you see the first news picture taken on the coast of Homer
S. Cummings, Democratic National Committee chairman and his wife. To get
this picture took some talking. .
“Mr. Cummings may I take a picture of you talking to your wife?”
asked Mac when he cornered them at the Palace.
“You mean Mrs. Cummings talking to her husband,” said, Mrs. Cum

“No,” said Cummings. ,
“Oh, come on outside. It will be lots of fun?” said Mrs. Cummings,
thereby winning Mac’s undying admiration.
‘My hat’s upstairs,” said Cummings.

Mrs. Ellis Meredith, delegate to the
Democratic National convention, here
who claims to have attended more
conventions than any woman demo
crat, says the most uncomfortable
one was at Kansas City in 1900 when
they had to buy cheese and crackers
at the corner grocery to keep from
starving.
“It looks like this is going to be
the most comfortable—for the wom
en anyway,’’ she said. “As for the
men—well, here’s the hideous truth,
the men here simply don’t know what
to do with us. We’re going to perme
ate this convention, but the men don’t
know whether we’ll do it like attar
of roses or like moth balls.”
