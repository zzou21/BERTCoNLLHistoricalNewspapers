HOTT

That's a bewhiskered chestnut In Phoenix, for It's always hot enough, but
you don't always have a chance to get as cool and comfortable summer shoes
as you do now at the AHEAD OF LATE Shoe Store. Canvas shoes are the
proper summer shoes, and we have lots of them.
We have workwoman's shoes, we keep workingman's hours, and we want
the workingman's trade. We close at 6 p. m. (Saturday excepted).

Choose Your Druggist Carefully
A druggist can do more
harm or good than most people
give him credit for.
There are different qualities in
drugs. Just as there are in dry
goods, and to the outsider all
qualities go by the same name.
The difference between pure,
high grade drugs, and cheap,
inferior drugs of the same name
means the difference between
getting sick and keeping well.
When a doctor writes a prescription he means best quality.
When some druggists fill a pre
scription they think only of his
profits.
Choose your druggist carefully.

READ AND REFLECT
Soon warm weather will be here, and
with that wood cook stove your kitchen
will be doubly hot. Your kitchen may
be kept as cool as your parlor if you
follow our directions.
First read this "Ad." through three
times and then show It to Pa, that he
may read It, and persuade him to
come with you to our store and see our

Make up
line of Wickless Blue Flame Oil Stoves.
Buy one, take it home, and use it to
cook, iron bake, brew and stew on until
next November. We have three different
makes of Wickless Blue Flame Oil
Stoves, ranging in price from $6.00 to
$35.50. But the Standard Lighting Co.
is the best one and costs more than the
other makes. More of them in use than
all other makes made. It is simpler,
more durable, safer, more economical
than any other stove on the market; it
works, a child can run it; it costs about
what it costs to run a wood stove; cool,
clean and convenient.
2-Burner Standard Wickless Blue
Flame Oil Stoves, $12.00
3-burner Standard Wickless Blue
Flame Oil Stoves, $16.00.
2-burner Cabinet Standard Wickless
Blue Flame Oil Stoves, $18.00.

Other makes, not Standard, cheaper.
We have sold nearly 200 Standard
Stoves in the territory in the past four
years. Other stoves come and go, are
bought and returned, closed out at
cost or shifted from one agent to an
other, but the Standard has been sold
from one store in Phoenix for the past
four years.

John Ernest Walker and Helena Hor
ning, and Juan Dionnes and Eplusea
Bincoma.
A CREAMERY EXPERT. Mr. J. A.
Robinson of West Virginia arrived in
the city yesterday. He will assume the
superintendency of the butter and
cheese making department of the
Maricopa Creamery company.
TONIGHT'S MEETING. This even
ing, at 8 o'clock, at O'Neill's hall, corner
of First avenue and Adams street, will
be held the mass meeting for the dis
cussion of the beet sugar matter. Every
business man and rancher should at

Charles Bell and H. H. Hoxworth have
filed with the county recorder notice of
the location of the Gila Monster Finel
tion mining claim. G. O. Roberts has
filed the location of the At-
three and a half feet long, not the
scalp, but the snake. Measurement was
made by the eye, aided and abetted by
the imagination.
A RATTLESNAKE'S SCALP. Col.
McCord and J. A. Kurtz returned yes
terday from a trip to the Buckeye
country. They brought with them the
scalp of a rattlesnake.
NEW STAGE LINE. It is understood
that a new stage line will be
placed in operation in a few days be
tween Arlington, on the Buckeye canal,
and the Aqua Caliente hot springs, to
run in connection with the line from
Phoenix to Arlington. Passengers de
siring to go to the hot springs will then
be able to secure through stage passage
from Phoenix, and the trip will take
two days.
AN EBONY CANE. Mr. T. K. Elvey
has a souvenir of the Philippines that
he prizes very highly for two reasons.
First, because it was brought back to
him by his son, who served with the
Thirty-fourth regiment, and, secondly,
because it is about the nicest thing in
the cane line that anybody ever had. It
is made of ebony and is most exquisitely
carved. Both the design and the ex
ecution of the work are marvelous.
FOR DRESS PARADE. The local
canton, the uniformed rank of the Odd
Fellows, has received a number of new
uniforms for its members. The canton
expects to turn out on the occasion of
the visit of President McKinley, and
the new uniforms will enable the or
ganization to make a much better
showing than heretofore. There are a
number of new members who are yet
without uniform, but an effort will be
made to secure them if possible before
May 7.
A YOUTHFUL TRAVELER. Rus
sell Mullin, a young gentleman from
Los Angeles, about six or seven years
old, arrived here yesterday morning on
the S. F., P. & P. train on a visit to his
grandmother, Mrs. E. R. Bishop,
who lives on North Fourth avenue. He
made the journey alone and experienced
no difficulty. In fact he was quite a
business-like sort of a boy, and when he
got here he hired a hack, gave his
grandmother's address, and traveled in
as much style as though he were fifty
years old and owned a railroad. He
probably will some day.
A SMALLPOX CURE. A California
country paper is agitating the develop
ment of a market in Arizona for the
California cider output, based on a
statement made in the San Francisco
Chronicle that elder has been proved a
specific for smallpox in Phoenix. In
the first place, while Phoenix has had
a few cases of smallpox in the past,
she never expects to have any more.
If she does have smallpox again and
wants to take the alcohol cure there is
an abundant supply here of a brand
that makes drunk come quicker and
hurt a great deal less than California
cider does.
WATER COMMISSIONERS' BONDS
The members of the water commis
sion, appointed by Judge Street,
have begun to file their bonds,
which are in the sum of $1,000
each. J. T. Priest presented his
to the board of supervisors with
Nels Peterson and Albert Miller, sureties. D. H. Heard, J. G. Peter
son and W. D. Fulwiler offered bonds
of the U. S. Fidelity company. All
were approved. A notary bond was
filed by James Gray and a butcher's
bond by P. T. Hurley. Edward Keene
was appointed road supervisor in dis
trict No. 4.
PROBATE COURT. In the matter of
the estate of Edward P. Hayden, a pe
tition for the partial distribution of
which had been filed, objection was
made to depositions tending to prove
the existence of an unknown heir of
Hayden. The depositions were submit
ted, subject to the objections. Other
evidence for and against the contention
of the objectors was presented and the
whole matter was set over for May 6.
The final account of Baxter McCreary,
administrator of the estate of D. A.
Spragg, was filed, and set for hearing
on May 9. H. I. Latham presented a
petition for letters of administration on
the estate of Robert J. Goodwillie, a
non-resident of this county, but whose
real estate here is valued at $3,500.
A TRANSFER OF REAL ESTATE.
The transfer of an important real
estate deal reported a week ago was
consummated yesterday by the passage
of a deed from E. M. Dorris to Field
& Gallagher to the northwest corner of
Fifth avenue and Washington street,
now occupied by J. A. Marshall's black
smith shop. The purchase price was
$21,000. The property has a frontage of
200 feet on Washington street and a
depth of 137 1/4 feet on the avenue. The
new owners have not yet determined
what they will do with the property,
but the price seemed so attractively low
and the promise of Phoenix so attrac
tively high that they could not resist
the temptation to get on the ground.
H. O. Minty of Tucson, department
commander, was to be present on the
occasion of the president's visit and
command the old veterans during the
exercises of the day. Mr. Gilbert T. Gray
has received a letter from him in which
he acknowledges his appreciation of the
invitation, though he is forced to de
cline the honor for the reason that, as
commander of Negley Post in Tucson,
he has extended the president an in
vitation to stop at Tucson long enough
to shake hands with the members of
that post. The president has accepted
his invitation and courtesy demands
that he must remain in command of his
post at that time.
MORE ABOUT OATS. This part of
Arizona has not made much of a repu
tation as an oat growing country,
that is when the oats are desired for
grain. But when it comes to
raising oat hay, there is no place under
the sun where water and soil will do
more business with oats, properly
planted, than right here in this valley.
They can be raised for grain, too,
as far as that is concerned, but for
that purpose a poorer soil is desirable,
so the grain will fill out and the nour
ishment will not all go to stalk. But
oat hay is where the Salt River valley
shines. Mention was made a day or
two ago of a sample of oats brought
into the board of trade. Yesterday Mr.
Austin Starkweather, who is farming
a quarter-section belonging to T. K.
Elvey, and which for private reasons
he has been trying to dispose of, yes
terday brought him in a bunch of oats
that was really surprising. The straw
measured seven feet and one inch in
length, and off a little distance looks
more like bamboo poles than like oat
straw. Still it is tender and nutritious
and makes just as good hay as the
little weakly straw that grows in some
countries where oat hay is made a
specialty.

ty recorder yesterday as follows: Stone

PRESS ASSOCIATION MEETING.
The members of the Arizona Press
association are respectfully invited to
attend a called meeting of the associa
tion at Phoenix, Arizona, on May 6,
1901. The objects of the meeting are
to assist in greeting and making Presi
dent McKinley welcome to Arizona on
his western visit and for the further
purpose of arranging to entertain the
various newspaper men who are accom
panying the president on his Pacific
coast tour while he is this city on May 7.
It is earnestly hoped that every mem
ber of the association will be present.
M. H. McCORD, President.
E. S. PERKINS, Secretary.
TO SHOW MR. M'KINLEY.
It is desired that an unusually fine ex
hibition of the resources of this valley
be made at the Board of Trade rooms
on the occasion of the president's visit.
The board requests that all who have
samples which will illustrate the min
eral and agricultural products be left
at the rooms of the board as soon as
possible that they may be properly ar
ranged. J. M. FORD,
President Board of Trade.
