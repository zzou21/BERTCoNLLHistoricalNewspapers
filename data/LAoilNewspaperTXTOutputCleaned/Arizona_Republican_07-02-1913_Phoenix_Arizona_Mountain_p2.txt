Orvie Overall is trying to dispute
that much-mooted and popular belief
"they can't come back." After two
seasons of quietude he has once more
limbered up his pitching arm and is
doing his best to aid Johnny Evers in
the hitters' efforts to solve the serious
problem of a pitching staff that is
sadly wanting in efficient material.
Overall has been slow in rounding
into form, but he candidly believes that
ere long he will prove of as much

Tigers Scratch Oaks
LOS ANGELES, July 1. The bril
liant pitching of Jack Killilay, Oakland's
erstwhile star twirler, failed to win
today's game for his team, Venice 1,
Oakland 0, was the final accounting.
Killilay allowed only 2 safeties, but
two of them were bunched in the 10th,
getting the Southerners the only tally.
Roy Hitt also pitched a good game,
keeping his ten hits well scattered
throughout the 10 innings. Hitt brought
in the Tigers only run with a drive
to right after Litschi doubled. Not a
Venice player reached second base un
til the seventh. Sensational catches
by the Venice outfielders undoubtedly
saved the game for the home club.

Seals Flop Away
SAN FRANCISCO, July 1. San
Francisco took the opening game of
the series from Los Angeles today by a
score of 9 to 1. Los Angeles used
three pitchers to stem the tide. Tozor
was taken out in the second, Jackson
who took his place was forced to give
way to "Dutch" Ruether, the former
St. Ignatius College twirler who took
the mound in the seventh. Jess Raker
pitched the entire game for the Seals,
striking out three men and allowing
only six hits.

PREPARATIONS

FOR 3 FIGHTS

Memsie-Kane Bout Promises to Be Some Scrap
Both Men Working Cut.
Two Corking Curtain
Raisers Arranged

Early yesterday morning old George
Memsie wriggled into a heavy sweater,
got out a pair of old trousers, and
with a pair of light shoes beat it out
east of town for a five mile jog of
road work. George in short is in train
ing still, for his fight with Walter
("Ruddy") Kane of Yuma, here on the
afternoon of July 4th. George is also
some old head at the game, probably
the best trial horse in his division of
pugs ever produced. Always a clever
scrapper, always a willing mixer, with
a kick in either mitt, he has fought
all the top notchers, has been many
times close to the championship of the
lightweight division, but has always
barely missed it. A miss being gener
ally as good as a mile, George Memsie
is still a mile away from the top of
his class.
All this does not mean however that
George is not there with both fists,
on the contrary, any youngster that
can put the old master away is among
the comers in his division. It was for
the purpose of obviating any possi
bility of being put away in the discard
by a younger man, that Old
George started doing the "old faithful"
training stunt as soon as he was
matched with Ruddy Kane. He real
izes that a youngster sometimes gets
over a 'wild pitch' which lands on the
sleep point with direful results. There
fore it behooves him to take no such
chances.
Kane is a scrappy youngster, and
showed so well in a recent go here
with Pete Daley, that Manager Gor
cister chose him as the opponent of
George Memsie to assist in celebrating
the Fourth of July. Kane will put up
a gritty three minute scrap,
unless dopesters are much mistaken.
Kane has been doing faithful work
training for the mill, realizing that it
is a chance for him. If he can get the
better of Memsie, even at catch weights
it means recognition for him with the
leaders of his business. He will be
a scrapper pretty generally needed to
be an attraction at big fights.
The manager of the afternoon has
arranged for a number of good
preliminaries which will work up the
blood of the fans even if the afternoon
is somewhat warm. These two events are
for four rounds only. Kid Acuna and
Jail Williams will go first, and Jimmy
Ruins and Jack Lyons will follow. The
main event will come thereafter.

MAROONS WANT GAME
Manager Castle's Team Out of Work
For July Fourth Wants Game

Telephone messages to this city yes
terday cancelled the expected baseball
game at Prescott between the Maroons
of this city and the Prescott team.
Manager Castle therefore was getting
busy last evening trying to hook up
with some team in the vicinity for a
game.
Having heard of the organization of
a new team out Mesa way he imme
diately expressed a preference for that
team. Today will likely tell the story.
If arrangements can be made for a
game the Maroons will play, otherwise
they will be spectators for somebody else's game.

PAY-AS-YOU-LEAVE STREETCARS

Cleveland Adopts a New System for the
Rush Hours.

A combination of the pay-as-you-enter
and pay-as-you-leave systems is
in effect in the street car service of
Cleveland, O., where peculiar traffic
conditions prevail. Cars from all sec
tions of the city come into the down
town district to the public square and
loop back, and it was for the purpose
of relieving the rush hour congestion
at that point that the combination sys
tem was adopted.
In the morning, when the passengers
are picked up all along the line and
unloaded practically all at once down
town, the car is operated pay-as-you-enter.
In the evening, when this con
dition is reversed, the car is operated
pay-as-you-leave. It is found that a
car can be loaded with one hundred
people in seventy seconds by loading
from both ends, if the collection of
fares is postponed until passengers
alight at various points along the line.

A BLOOMING NOSE

Loses Fifteen Round Go for Canadian
Lightweight Champion "Don't
Yer Know"

VANCOUVER, July 1. Frenchy
Vaise, of Seattle was given the de
cision over Joe Bayley, the Canadian
lightweight champion in a 15-round
bout at the Lighthouse arena today.
In the first five rounds Bayley made
Vaise look like a novice, but in the
sixth the Seattle boy landed a right
cross to the nose apparently breaking
it, causing the blood to flow during
the remainder of the fight, the loss
causing Bayley to weaken. At the end
of the bout Vaise had a sufficient lead
to gain the decision.

RITCHIE HAS BETTER
OF BETTING ODDS NOW

But Indications Point to Even Money
at Ringside of Championship
Bout. Both Boys Fit

Associated Press Dispatch
SAN FRANCISCO, July 1. Willie
Ritchie, the lightweight champion of
the world and Joe Rivers, the Mexican
of Los Angeles, finished hard training
today for their 20 round match on July
4. Both are within easy striking dis
tance of the weight, which is 134 three
hours before gong. Both will do only
light work from now on.
Ritchie is the favorite, but the pre
diction is even money will rule at ring
side. Both men are in the pink of
condition. A comparison of the meas
urements shows Ritchie has slight ad
vantage in height and reach, but Rivers
is more solidly built about the neck,
chest, arms, shoulders, though trim
mer in the wrists and ankles.
A close watch of the training camps
seems to show Rivers is faster on his
feet, packs a much heavier punch and
shoots in more blows. On the other
hand he seemed to show a more vul
nerable defense and less accurate of
fense. Expert opinion has about
reached the conclusion that the finish
will depend on the relative courage of
each and the ability to assimilate
punishment.

WILSON ON "VACATION"

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
WASHINGTON, July 1. Off for a
real holiday of 72 hours. President
Wilson is aboard the yacht Mayflower
tonight somewhere in lower Chesapeake
Bay. No attempt will be made to keep
the yacht in touch with Washington
by wireless and even the White House
officials do not know the executive's
whereabouts. The last word was re
ceived this afternoon when the May
flower was reported "steaming down
the Bay."

SULZER IS NAMED

Governor of New York Is Defendant
In Breach of Promise Suit

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
PHILADELPHIA, July 1. Governor
William Sulzer of New York was nam
ed as defendant in a breach of prom
ise suit when the summons in tres
pass was issued today according to

liam Sulzer was in New York. The
plaintiff is Miss Mignon Hopkins an

AMUSEMENTS

AT THE LION.
"A Girl Spy in Mexico," a Lubin;
"One Hundred Dollar Reprieve," an
Edison; "Disciplining Daisy" and "Que
bec Palace," Vitagraph, compose
the brand new program opening at
the Lion Theatre last night for three
days only. It will be repeated today
and tomorrow.
"A Girl Spy in Mexico" is the fea
ture of the program. It is in two
parts and taken in the hills of old
Mexico. Lieut. Blanco's sweetheart,
the Senorita Armaje, having heard no
word from him, goes to his camp,
finds him, and determines to work
for her lover's side of the question.
She dons the garb of a red cross
nurse and enters the federal lines
and conveys to Blanco from time to
time important information. She is
finally discovered and placed under
arrest, the officers marching them
onward to the end.

COLISEUM.
Comedy is the order of the day
in the vaudeville acts which opened
the week at this popular playhouse
last night, and the management has
discovered a sure cure for the blues
and the "ill effects" of the hot wea
ther. La Bella Guillermo opens the
bill with a little song and dance of
fering that pleases from the start.
Reynolds & Lewis follow and put
over a classy cornedy singing and
yodeling act in which Reynolds
proves not only his versatility but his
distinct ability as a yodler. His imi
tations include several musical in
struments, in fact he plays an entire
band from the snare drum to the
trombone with his voice. Especially
truthful was his imitation of the
electric chime whistle found on inter
urban railways. This is no natural
act that one can almost see the car start.
He brought the house down with it.
Closing the bill, Young Manning
present the greatest comedy act that
has visited the city in many months.
The net is a scream and they take
advantage of every opportunity for
furnishing a laugh with the result
that the audience is kept in a roar
during the entire time they are on
the stage. Mr. Young proved beyond
all question of a doubt that he is
one of the most clever black face
artists in the business. His work is
finished in every particular and
shows careful preparation. A very
laughable feature of the act is the
introduction of a chicken fight, in
duced by Young, which furnishes fun
by the bushel. The movies were new.
The two-reel Vitagraph feature "The
Web" proved one of the strongest
dramas ever shown on the local
screen, and is sure to find favor in
the hearts of all lovers of real mov
ing pictures.

EMPRESS.
This week's bill at the Empress
is well balanced and is proving quite a drawing card
in as much as each act is a feature
in itself. The show is opened by
Bryce Howatson Co. Mr. Howatson
bears an enviable reputation as an
actor of ability as is shown by
the manner in which he handles the
act. The Eckart Family Trio en
joyed much favor from the opening
night, and well is it deserved as their
work bespeaks talent and lots of it
on the part of each member. From
a standpoint of harmony the work of
the trio has not been duplicated in
any other house in the city.
