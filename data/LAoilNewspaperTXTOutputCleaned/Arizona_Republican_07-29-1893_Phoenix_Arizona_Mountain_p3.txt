MESA CITY, ARIZONA, JULY 29, 1893.

MESA NOTES.

Mr. M. J. Forator drove down to the
hospital yesterday on business.

The carload of ore last shipped by O.
H. Hall is reported on good authority
have averaged $2,000 per ton.

Another Chinaman started for the
Goldfield mining camp today. We will
perhaps hear of him further in a few
days.

Stero Bailey and Charley Hall drove
up to the mines in the Superstition
mining camp yesterday morning and
will return in a few days.

Messrs. C. R. Hakes and J. R. Morbo
started up to the mines yesterday after
noon. They have some fine claims
there which are turning out rich.

Mr. Wilson of Phoenix, who has been
staying in our busy city for a few days,
will go back to the capital tomorrow.
He says times are busier in the real es
tate line here than in Phoenix.

Mr. A. Spalding came down from the
mines last night. He has been working
for Hall on the Mammoth for about a
month. He says the Mammoth is
the richest mine he ever saw and be
lieves that the camp will be one of the
richest in the United States.

A petition is circulating in Mesa for
the benefit of Abe Grooms, who is af
flicted with cancer in the face. He
desires to go to California to receive
treatment and is financially unable to
do so, and the people, with their usual
feeling of charity, are subscribing liber
ally toward the unfortunate.

Bill Huntingdon and Coleman came
down from the mines yesterday morn
ing where they had been on a prospect
ing tour. They report the camp lively.
Either strikes there are reported at the
old claims and all seem confident that the Superstition mining
camp is one of the richest in the world.

Mr. David Cluff, mother and sweet
heart, arrived in Mesa this morning
from Smithville, on the Gila river, to
visit his brother and other friends he
has here. Mr. Cluff was here about
two years ago and said he was surprised
to see how rapidly the city and sur
rounding country had built up and the
prosperity seen on every hand. Mr.
Cluff will visit with us for a week or so.

Hon. Thomas E. Farish, superintendent
of the Vulture mine, and his
brother, John B. Farish, a prominent
mining man of Denver, Col., passed
through Mesa today en route for the
Goldfield mining camp to look over the
prospects there. Hon. T. E. Farish a
short time ago bonded for $35,000 the
claim belonging to Jones, Bowen and
others, and it is this mine they are in
vestigating, and if it proves to be what
he anticipated, active development
will begin at once on a large scale.

the overdraft on his nerves at having
to jump fences, his eye for a country
may stand him in good stead. To all
of us there comes a time when we must
say with the Latin poet: "I am not
what I once was;" and when that mo
ment arrives we must look out, unless
we would fathom the depths of fogy
dom, for such amusements as may call
for no more vigor than we can con
veniently put forth. In this particular
golf comes happily to the rescue. It
appeals to the man of somewhat lazy
proclivities, as well as to him who is
past his prime, either by reason of the
weight of years or by having to follow
a sedentary occupation. With the ad
vantages of genial companionship, an
inducement not to loiter by the way,
yet without the necessity to run as
though the last train were about to
start, golf holds a place to which
possibly no other amusement can lay
claim; and the number of its devotees
of the class we have mentioned is its
best testimonial.

CHANGES IN EXTRADITION LAW.

In Early Modern Times Political Refugees
Were the Only Ones Sought.
It is a remarkable fact that in the
early cases in modern history it was
always for political offenses that sur
render was claimed, though at present
it is almost the only ground of refusal,
says Chambers' Journal. But such an
offense does not mean a crime commit
ted from political motives, but one
committed during a time of civil war
or open insurrection. The French gov
ernment in 1880 refused to extradite
Hartmann, who was suspected of plan
ning the plot against the czar at
Moscow in December, 1879. When the
Swiss government in November, 1860,
demanded the extradition of one Cas
toni, who had shot a member of the
ministry, the English judge gave him
the benefit of this exception in the
treaty. Charles II., as is well known,
pursued some of the murderers of his
father with relentless hate, and in 1661
concluded a treaty in Denmark in
which the latter agreed to deliver up
on requisition all persons who had
been concerned in the murder of
Charles I.

The States General of Holland sur
rendered some of the regicides without
stipulations; but in 1665 they
refused to give up any persons excepted
from the English act of indemnity and
all other persons demanded by the
English government. James II. put
this treaty in force in demanding the
surrender of Burnet, not yet a bishop,
but acting as private secretary to the
prince of Orange. He describes it very
fully in his "History of His Own Time."
He stated that the king's principal
anger against him was a report of his
intended marriage to a wealthy lady
at The Hague, and proceedings were
set on foot in Scotland. Burnet, how
ever, got wind of the matter before the
news of it reached d'Albeville, then
English ambassador, and petitioned for
naturalization, which was readily
granted. When the ambassador demanded
his banishment, Burnet claimed pro
tection of the states as a naturalized
subject. The demand was subsequently
repeated in more forcible terms, but
the states refused to surrender him.

THE ATTRACTIONS OF GOLF.
An English Authority Says It's a Stunning
Game for Men of Mature Years.
In one sense "golf" may be taken as a
protest against the "constitutional"
that mere aimless walk which is equal
ly distasteful to the active and the in
firm. Like an unfenced hunting coun
try, says the London Field, the golf
links offer a fitting area for recreation
to those who are no longer what they
once were, and who are no longer equal
to holding their own against the more
lightly weighted youth. The hunting
man who has erstwhile led the way
over the broad pastures of the Shires,
frequently takes refuge, in his maturer
years, in a plow country wherein
hounds run less fast; and eventually,
perhaps, is found hunting on the
Brighton Downs, where, freed from

The Consolidated is the largest of the great canals of
the south side. The system now consists of 40 miles of main
canal; 75 miles of main laterals and 150 miles of smaller
laterals so distributed that 100,000 acres of land may be
irrigated.
Besides this great system the following canals with
underlying territory must be considered: The Highland
canal, 20 miles, 15,000 acres; the Mesa canal, 10 miles, 20,
000 acres; the Utah, 10 miles, 20,000 acres; the Tempe, 15
miles, 30,000.
The entire region about Mesa derives its life from these
systems which are also contributory in the highest de
gree to the agricultural prosperity of the country around
Tempe.
There is a rapidly spreading belief that that part of the
valley in which these two flourishing towns are located is
the garden spot of Arizona and developments justify the
growing belief.

It is not improper in this connection to describe briefly
the grounds upon which this belief is based and the natural
reasons why it is so.
The country about Mesa will probably within the next
ten years enjoy the widely circulated distinction of being the
most productive fruit-growing region in the United States
as it is now known to be the chief fruit belt of the valley.
The altitude is 81.6 feet higher than Tempe and 172
feet above Phoenix, rendering it somewhat cooler than either
place in summer and slightly warmer in winter.

Vineyards dot the country in every direction and hun
dreds of broad acres are set to oranges, almonds, dates, etc.
Mesa City, the center of this lovely region, is an ideal village
of 1,200 people, situated 6.8 miles east of Tempe and about
17 miles from Phoenix.
The business and commercial interests include one
bank, seven general merchandise stores, one hardware store,
two blacksmith shops, one lumber yard and two saloons.
The buildings are of a good character and become
more pretentious yearly. As might be expected in such a
community there are excellent church and school facilities
and the town is sufficiently metropolitan to support a small
opera house.

Communication is maintained with the neighboring
cities of Tempe and Phoenix by means of two daily stages.
Three miles east of Mesa City is the prosperous village
of Lehi, among whose other industries and features is a
creamery, the best in Arizona and known throughout the
territory.
The mesa proper extends to the river, four miles north
of Mesa City; on the south it is almost limitless, a stretch
of country which within ten years will be known as the
Garden Spot of America. -
