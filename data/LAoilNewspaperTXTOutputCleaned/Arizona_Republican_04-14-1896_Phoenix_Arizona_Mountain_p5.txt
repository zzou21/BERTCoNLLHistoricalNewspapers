NEWS IN A NUTSHELL.
Happenings of Streets
and Town.

Intelligence.
The Doings of a Day In Phoenix and
its Tributary
Region.
The Postal company now runs an all
night service.
City registration for the coming
elections began yesterday.
The new city council of Tempe held
its first meeting last night.
This evening will be held an adjourned meeting of the city council.
The Brazilian gypsies who were driven out of Arizona are now in Los
Angeles.
Yuma has now a detachment of the
Salvation Army, commanded by Captain Miss Mathews.
This evening at the Baptist church
will be celebrated the marriage of
James S. Griffin and Miss Delia Kalfus.
Now is the season of roses in Phoenix and every yard is fragrant and
gorgeously colored from these loveliest of flowers.
Five ordinary Sunday cases of drunk
and mildly disorderly came before the
city recorder yesterday. They were
fined small sums.
A carload of horses for Prescott and
several carloads of stock for Los An
geles were attached to yesterday morn
ing's Santa Fe train.
A twenty-five horsepower boiler and
a four inch Thompson & Davis pump
has been lately placed on the prison
farm at Yuma for irrigation.
The administration circle has been
enlarged by a new comer who is com
missioned by the Ruler of the universe
to gladden the household of Assistant
Secretary Devereux. It is a fine boy.
A social will be given for the benefit
of the Methodist church at the resi
dence of Mrs. W. A. Davis on West
Washington street, in Collins' addi
tion. The little black flag beneath the
larger white one betokens a continuance
of the cold wave. Yet it is not
very cold, simply a pleasant contrast
to the warmer weather of the past few
weeks.
Tomorrow will be held the regular
convention of the Republican party for
Maricopa county and by that conven-
tion will be selected the delegates who
will represent the county at the terri
torial convention.
That's
Different.

That's different. We are giving the shoe busi
ness our earnest attention and have goods that
are up-to-date and of the best quality, at as low
prices as is possible to buy them.

Tempe News: A force of workmen
are engaged in clearing away the de
bris of the late fire and we are reliably
informed that the work of replacing
the burnt buildings will be commenced
within ten days.
Yuma Advertiser: Mr. Louie Leager
has decided not to build a $2,000 house,
as was his intention, but will invest
that amount in a pumping plant to ir
rigate his 160 acres of patented land,
which he will seed to alfalfa and grain
for his porkers.
Monday April 6, was the regular
date for the meeting of the territorial
board of control which, instead of
holding its session at Yuma as hereto
fore, ordered all accounts sent to Phoe
nix. It is thought that this is an in
novation that will be continued.
Officers Galpin and Webster were the
victims of a robbery Saturday night,
while they were prowling around the
outskirts on the lookout for depreda
tions on the property of others. Cloth
ing and everything else that could be
found were taken. Conservative esti
mates fix the loss at least a dollar.
The board of supervisors yesterday,
by resolution, made objection to an ex
amination of their books by C. W.
Culver, representing the Citizens'
league. They affirm that Culver, who
was the expert of the last grand jury,
is prejudiced and partial, and ask that
some other expert be chosen for the
task.
The recent change in the manage
ment of the Ford hotel has increased
the popularity of that excellent house.
Mrs. Mary A. Lee, the lessee, and Mr.
H. R. Borden, the gentlemanly man
ager, are even improving the service
and all the guests are extremely well
pleased with the accommodations and
courtesy received.
Charlie Besse, one of the pioneers of
Phoenix, died yesterday morning of
pneumonia. He was about 64 years of
age, a native of Germany. He came to
Phoenix about 1878 and here has made
a living by divers means, as a mu
sician and latterly as the owner of the
old bootblack stand of Kane's barber
shop. The funeral will be today from
the residence on East Monroe street.
Yuma Sentinel: One day this week
while the steamer Aztec was attempt
ing to make a connection with the
barge which was moored below, the
Indian pilot misunderstood his orders
and attempted to make a turn instead
of backing down, with the result that
the boat got into the current beyond
control and went down against the
piers of the railroad bridge and broke
her guards.
In the local contemporary press there
appears of late to have been a very
run of distressing typographical er
rors. To the collection may be added
one found in The Record of the South
ern California University. The writer,
in a clever Easter article, wrote of
"the wreaths of immortality." The
compositor and proofreader together
are responsible for the fact that the
matter in the printed journal read
"the wretches of immorality."
The calico, percale and Victoria lawn
sale at Alkire's is still on with una
bated interest. The shirt sale at 3
cents was all exhausted yesterday and
no further calls can be filled for that
particular grade. Stocks of the other
three specialties are dwindling, but
are still fresh. Indigo calico, the gen
uine stuff, at 5 cents per yard, is not
often found in Arizona, likewise those
wide percales at 5 cents and 7 cents
per yard, and the Victoria lawn at
6 cents.
Peoria, as the home of Rev. H. A.
Thompson, naturally is not backward
in the matters of devotion, and boasts
of a thriving Presbyterian congrega
tion that meets in the neat school
house to the eastward of the railroad.
There is also a Sunday school and a
society of Christian Endeavor; these
organizations lately, through the me
dium of a successful social, having
completed payment for an organ. The
congregation during the last week has
had the pleasant task of entertaining
the members of the Presbytery of Ari
zona, the association electing to hold
its annual session at the pleasant lit
tle suburban town.
J. H. Mulford, a well-known mining
man, who returned last night from a
trip to his claims in the lower Brad
shaw mountains, brings with him a re
markable story, as well as a fine fox
skin. The occupant of the hide, he
says, he discovered asleep a few days
ago on a sunny slope of a canyon. The
fox is usually considered the slyest of
animals, one that usually sleeps with
one eye and one ear open. This one,
however, must have had a surfeit of
dinner, for he slept serenely on while
Mulford was creeping carefully upon
him. The only weapon the miner had
was a prospector's pick and with one
blow of this he smashed the skull of
the animal.
One of the handsomest orchards in
the valley, emphatically believed by
Manager H. C. Mann to be the very
handsomest, is one of apricots on the
Greenhut ranch at Peoria. The apri
cot trees, of the Newcastle and Royal
varieties, are luxuriant in foliage and
thrifty in growth to the most remark
able degree and the fruit, well hidden
behind the leaves, gives evidence of a
heavy crop. Yet there is not a tree
in the orchard of thirty-five acres
from which the fruit may not be gath
ered by a man of ordinary height.
Every tree has "trimmed down" that
fruit and trunk may be sheltered from
the sun and the broad spreading tops
are as regularly flat as though a
gigantic mower has been run over them.
Sunday morning's Santa Fe train for
the north was loaded with delegates to
the Odd Fellows grand lodge, that
convened at Prescott yesterday morn
ing. Among the departures were:

From Phoenix, P. H. Coyle, A. E.
Hinton, S. N. Phillips, J. E. Dufton,
George Mintz; from Tempe, E. A. Mur
phy, Otto Butzer, Geo. L. Compton;
from Mesa, W. D. Morton, Phil Mets;
from Globe, Harley C. Hitchcock;

Louis Sultan; from Tucson and the
south, E. P. Van Kuren, J. J. Hill, W.
D. Monmonier, G. S. Shiveley, E. R.
Jones, E. Marks, J. A. Flood, J. H.
Mapes. The Maricopa & Phoenix
train was kindly run in ahead of time
about forty minutes, allowing of a
transfer without loss of time from the
southern road.
YAVAPAI PRIMARIES.
A Spirited Contest Is Held in Pres
cott
Prescott Journal-Miner: The Re
publican primaries took place in Yav
apai county Saturday for the election
of delegates to the county convention,
which meets at Prescott April 20.
There are two candidates in the field
for delegate to the National convention
at St. Louis. C. H. Akers and I. T.
Stoddard. Each has been engaged for
several weeks in making an active can
vass for the place, and it was decided
at a meeting held in Prescott that the
issue in this city be left to a test of
strength between the two candidates.
Accordingly each had a ticket pre
pared and all day friends of the re
spective candidates have been active in
rustling votes for their favorite. Polls
were held in the building adjoining
Voigtlander's tailor shop, opening at
10 o'clock a. m. and closing at 4 p. m.
The Akers ticket read as follows:
"McKinley and free silver." D. W.
Pritchett, James C. Maxwell, F. E.
Andrews, F. S. Emmal, B. S. Goffman,
George R. Parker, George Wickler,
James W. Akers.
The Stoddard ticket was as follows:
"For Arizona and Free Silver." A.
O. Brodie, E. W. Wells, W. H. Smith,
Sam E. Bright, Fred G. Brecht, John
S. Ross, Samuel Hill, Joseph Dough
erty.
It will be noticed that both tickets
are composed of representative citi
zens, but the individuals composing the
tickets were lost sight of, the issue not
being of the individuals whose names
appeared on the ticket, but of the can
didate they favored for delegate to St.
Louis.
The total vote cast was 414.
Six of the Stoddard delegates were
elected, their vote standing:
Joseph Dougherty, 213; S. E. Bright,
213; T. G. Brecht, 213; J. S. Ross, 218;
A. O. Brodie, 212; Sam Hill, 209. Two
Akers delegates were elected, C. M.
Maxwell with 210 votes and George
Wickler with 209 votes.

Cafe are adding regular patrons daily
