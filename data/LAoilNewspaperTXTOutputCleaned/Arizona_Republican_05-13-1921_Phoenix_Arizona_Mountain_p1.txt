OPPOSITION IN
SENATE DEBATE

Little Progress Made In
First Consideration of
Bill Disarmament Ad-
vocates Promise Fight
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, May 12. The
half-billion dollar naval appropria
tion bill was taken up today in the
senate only to encounter immediate
opposition from disarmament advocates.

Shortly after its reading the naval af
fairs committee's amendments had
started, the first rumblings of the
imminent fight were heard. The first
amendment slightly increasing ap
propriations of the house bill was
carried without discussion but when
the amendment was reached to in
crease the sum for recruiting by a
million dollars. Senator Borah, re
publican, of Idaho asked that it be
passed over until the senate takes
the question of naval personnel.

Progress Frequently Blocked
- This request was repeated time af
ter time with the result that when
the day ended practically all of the
major committee increases in the
first half of the bill had been passed
over. These included the appropria
tions for the Key West, Fla., subma
rine base, San Diego, Cal., naval hos
pital project, Guam submarine and
destroyer bases, and Sand Point,
Washington, air station, San Pedro,
Cal., submarine base, and the Alameda, Cal., supply base.

Senator Borah, before asking that
the Alameda project be passed over
until later when he announced he
wished to discuss them, made a point
of order authorizing the secretary to
accept for naval purposes at Alameda, Los Angeles, Camp Kearney, Cal.,
and in King county, Washington. The
vice president, however, over-ruled
his contention that the provision was
general legislation.

Senator King, Democrat, of Utah
attacked the bill, contending that
procrastination of the 1916 building
program was a waste of money.
"The navy department," he declared, "has gone into the tomb and
dug up the naval program of 1915.
We haven't apparently learned any
thing from the war."

Says Bill Is War-Like

The senator described the bill as a

war-like message from the United States to the nations of the world.
He read a press dispatch saying that
Great Britain, because of the Amer
ican naval bill, had decided to contract
immediately for the building of
four 35,000-ton vessels of the super
dreadnought type. Many ships now in ser
vice should be scrapped, he asserted,
adding that the Pacific fleet was
made up of obsolete "hulks."

Predicting there would be a "resistless tide" in favor of world peace
and a universal demand that the
United States assume the leadership
in a movement. Senator King de
clared that the decision of congress
on naval appropriations would de
mand, whether the United States is
to be a peaceful or an aggressive na
tion." At this moment when we are con
sidering the appropriation of $500,000,000 of the country's money," Sen
ator Borah interjected, "and the es
tablishment of a policy which means
billions more, there are seven sen
ators in the chamber."

Urge Government Control of
Shipping for Life of Strike
(Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, May 12. Winthrop L. Marvin, secretary of the Amer
ican Steamship Owners' association, announced today that the Pacific
coast operators had telegraphed Secretary of Commerce Hoover and
Admiral Benson of the shipping board urging them to request President
Harding to declare that a nationwide
shipping strike.

The telegram recommended that the government take over the
manning of vessels if the strikers refused to return to work within 48
hours.
Mr. Marvin said his association had no information as to who
signed the telegram and added that no similar action was contem
plated by ship owners.
A. H. Raymond, president of the American Steamship Owners' as
sociation, characterized as a malicious invention the statement of An
drew Furuseth, made yesterday in Washington, that the stand taken by
the shipping board and the steamship owners in the wage dispute was
part of an international plot to destroy American shipping.

"The accusations," he said, "means that the shipping board is be
traying the country, and that American shipping companies are pro
posing to destroy their own property. Stated in this way it is easy
to recognize how preposterous it is."
Today was pronounced by Mr. Marvin to be the owners' best since
the strike began, while B. L. Todd, for the engineers, asserted that
the situation was decidedly bright for the unions.
Sailings reported today included nine American ships of which one
company, the United States lines, claimed to have sailed five. Among
the latter was the steamer Mount Clay, a 12,000 ton former German
ship, with passengers and cargo for Hamburg.

CHICAGO, May 12. The national
executive committee of the Farmer-

Labor party after a three-day session

made public a statement today de
claring that there was no difference
between the Republican and Demo

cratic parties and that the only

"peaceable remedy for the workers is
to supplement the efforts of the trade
unions, farmer organizations and co
operative societies by independent
political action through the Farmer
Labor party.
"President Harding made his cam

paign on the issue of opposition to

President Wilson's League of Nations,"
the statement said. "He is now in the
act of embroiling the United States
again in the intrigues of the un
principled plotters of Europe."
The statement also assailed the
Esch-Cummins law and declared that
"the Republican administration, how
ever, finds this measure not suf
ficiently oppressive of labor and is
about to amend it to abolish the rail
road labor board."
"President Harding's administra
tion," the statement continued, "is
said also to be about to abolish the

federal trade commission which ex
posed the lawlessness of the beef
trust and stimulated the popular de
mand for federal control of the meat
packing industry.
"The courts, likewise, continue
their humble service for Wall street
and their stony indifference to the
welfare of the workers. The United
States Supreme Court has destroyed
the protection for labor which was
contained in the Clayton act, has
served wealth by whitewashing the
election of Senator Newberry of
Michigan, and prevented the use of
the Lever act to punish profiteers, al
though it was liberally used to lash
labor.
"The United States court of appeals
at Minneapolis has declared invalid
North Dakota's grain grading law for
the protection of farmers. The only

peaceable remedy is by independent
political action through the Farmer
Labor party."

HONOLULU, May 12. Mrs. Paul
Vincent Southard, also known as
Mrs. Lyda E. Meyer, was held by the
police here today on orders from Los
Angeles in connection with the death
of four of her husbands, a brother-in-law,
and a child of one of the men
she married.
Paul Southard, whom she married
in Los Angeles last November, told
the police here she tried to get him
to take out $10,000 worth of life in
surance. Southard is a petty officer
on the U. S. S. Monterey, stationed
at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Insurance
of which she was the beneficiary,
was carried on the lives of all the
four men whose deaths are being in
vestigated. Mrs. Southard, according to the
police, has agreed to return without
extradition papers. Papers for ex
tradition are being prepared.

To Be Tried in Idaho
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, May 12.

Lyda Meyer, charged with the
murder of her fourth husband, Ed
ward F. Meyer, at Twin Falls, Idaho,
September 7, 1920, was arrested at
Honolulu today, according to a dis
patch received by the Salt Lake Tel
egram. V. H. Ormsby, deputy sher
iff of Twin Falls, at present in Los
Angeles, said he was awaiting ex
tradition papers being prepared at
Twin Falls to bring her back to

Idaho for trial. The deputy sheriff
also informed the paper that Mrs.
Meyer married Vincent Southard of
the U. S. S. Chicago, November 20,
last.
Prosecuting Attorney Frank L.
Stephan of Twin Falls county, Idaho,
said Mrs. Southard's matrimonial
record was being investigated for the
purpose of determining the causes
and fixing the responsibility for the
deaths of three other former hus
bands, an infant child by Robert
Dooley, her first husband, and Dooley's brother, Edward.
Insurance in which Mrs. Southard
was the beneficiary was carried on
the lives of all five men, Stephan
said, and of which she is said to
have collected $9,500. Mrs. South
ard, who is 28 years old, worked for
a while as a waitress at Twin Falls
after Meyer's death.

Her Matrimonial Record
Mrs. Southard's matrimonial his
tory and the dates of her husbands'
deaths as given out by the author
ities follow:
Married Robert C. Dooley, Idaho
farmer, at Twin Falls, March 17, 1912.
He died in Twin Falls hospital Oc
tober 1, 1913, typhoid being assigned
as the cause.
Married William G. McHaffie,
Twin Falls waiter, at Twin Falls, in
June, 1917. He died at Hardin, Mont.,
October 22, 1918; death reported to
have been from influenza and diph
theria.
Married Harlan C. Lewis, auto
mobile mechanic of Billings, Mont.,
at Denver, Colo., March 10, 1919. He
died at Billings on July 6, 1919;
cause of death reported as gastro
enteritis.
Married Edward F. Meyer, foreman
Blue Lakes ranch, Twin Falls coun-
ty, Idaho, at Pocatello, Idaho, on Aug
ust 10, 1920. He died at Twin Falls
hospital September 7, 1920. Autopsy
revealed traces of poison.
In two more cases the prosecut
ing attorney said Mrs. Southard fail
ed to collect insurance on her hus
bands' lives. The policy on McHaffie's life he said was allowed to lapse
Meyer, the fourth husband, carried
$10,000 insurance, which was increas
ed $2,000 shortly before his death, but
no attempt was made to collect it.
Not long after the first marriage,
prosecuting attorney Stephan said,
the Dooley brothers jointly assumed
an insurance policy on their lives for
$2,000, naming Mrs. Dooley as the
beneficiary. This was in addition to
the $2,500 carried by the husband.
Edward Dooley died August 9,
1915, after an illness of ten days and
the insurance was paid to the sur
viving Dooley and his wife. On Octo
ber 1, 1913, Robert C. Dooley died
and the insurance on his life was
paid.
An examination of the ranch house
where Meyer and his wife lived in
Twin Falls county is said to have re
vealed a quantity of poison.

Plan To Clamp Down Dry
Lid Finds Little Opposi
tion From Wets Drys
Turn Out Strong
Republican A. P. Leased Wire

WASHINGTON, May 12. Signs
of the days when the drys were batt
ling to bury John Barleycorn were
re-enacted today before the house ju
diciary committee, except that few
friends of John's family appeared to
protest against Chairman Volstead's
plan to cut off, even for medicinal
purposes, the heritage of beer.

Many Drys Appear
Plenty of drys were on hand and
Dr. J. P. Davin of New York, who
pleaded for the use of beer as medi
cine, was given none too cordial
treatment. In fact, he was roughly
handled by Volstead, who challenged
the physician's ability to "explain
anything" and on another occasion
declared the witness was using "a
conglomeration of words that mean
nothing."

Outstanding in the testimony was
the statement by Oliver T. Remmers,
counsel for the Anheuser-Busch com
pany of St. Louis, that the firm's
policy was for beer for all, or beer
for none." He requested an inves
tigation of "favoritism and failure"
in the dry law enforcement and de
clared that the firm stood four square
for law enforcement, although unal
terably opposed to prohibition.

Dry leaders said there were many
leaks in the stocks of liquors and
urged the committee to make the
Volstead law airtight. Dr. Davin,
however, resented the move by Mr.
Volstead to "dictate to physicians"
what they shall or shall not prescribe
and urged the committee to await
consideration of the bill by the Amer
ican Medical association next month.

Volstead Insulted

Mr. Volstead sought to establish
why it was possible for physicians
to make medical beer by using cereal
beverages and alcohol. He asked Dr.
Davin several questions along this
line, none of which apparently was
answered to the satisfaction of the
committee chairman, who finally
blurted: "Look here, you're trying
to evade every question I ask. Tell
us what you know, if you know so
much."

The witness again attempted an
explanation but was interrupted by
Mr. Volstead who inquired why cert
eal beverages were not as good for
the invalid as beer with a kick.
"Ah, that's the point," replied the
witness. "Near beer is just like
near-statesmanship. It can't accom
plish any noticeable result."

"I don't think you know what you
are talking about," returned the
chairman, "nor do I think your in
sults will get far with the commit
tee."

Several committee members evinc
ed interest in the kind of diseases
for which the witness said he would
prescribe beer. Most of them, how
ever, were said by the witness to
yield slowly to curative treatments.
Some were curable only in exception
al cases, he added.
Dry Law Unpopular

E. V. Claypool, superintendent of
the Rhode Island Anti-Saloon league,
declared that the Volstead law was
unpopular in his state.
Asked if the law was being en
forced as well there as in other sec
tions, he said:
"Yes, the draft act also was en
forced throughout the United States,
but, nevertheless, Bergdoll is in Ger
many and Edsel Ford did not go."

Officials of the American Drug
Manufacturers' associations were be
fore the committee to discuss tech
nical provisions of the bill. The as
sociation was represented by spokesmen
as favoring the prohibition of
beer but as objecting to some of the
provisions appertaining to their lines
of industry.
Several expressed fear that if the
prescribing of beer was permitted,
drug establishments would be trans
formed into mere dispensers of beer
and that the change would lower the
ethical standard of the business.

Measure Would Rob De

partment of Labor of Its
Functions, Gompers
says in statement
(Republican A. P. Leased Wire)
CINCINNATI, May 12 The exec
utive council of the American Federa
tion of Labor today entered the fight
to prevent the passage of the bill
before congress to create a depart
ment of public welfare.

President Samuel Gompers, in ac
cordance with instructions from the
council, telegraphed Senator Kenyon
chairman of the senate committee on
education, a protest against creation
of the new department and asked that
representatives of the federation be
afforded an opportunity to appear
before the committee.
Hope to Retain Power

"We most solemnly protest," said
the message, "against the enactment
of any measure that would weaken
or take from the department of la
bor any functions given that depart
ment or weaken the power of the de
partment.

Mr. Gompers, in a statement, said
that the council was protesting
against the "parsimonious policy of
congress toward the department of
labor and its attempt to starve that
department out of existence."
"We have been nearly thirty years
trying to establish this department,"
he added, "but now certain interests
are attempting to weaken and de
stroy our cherished work. The ene
mies of organized labor would like
to ruin the labor department by dis
membering it under the guise of cre
ating a department of welfare."
The executive council today com
pleted its legislative hearing and
made plans to oppose anti-labor leg
islation in the state.
The high cost of living was also
discussed and the council recom
mended that the system of basing
wages on the cost of living be dis
couraged, as the workers are entitled
to more than a wage that gives them
a decent living.

Condemns Soviet Regime
A tentative declaration on the at
titude of the federation toward the
Soviet government of Russia was read
but action was delayed until tomor
row. The declaration condemns the Soviet
regime in Russia and contends that
the American trade union movement
must not give aid or support to the
Bolsheviki.
The report asserted that the soviet
is not representative of the people
of Russia, but it was the rule of a
minority by the aid of a military dic
tatorship. The Bolsheviki leaders, it
was charged, are attempting to de
stroy the organized labor movement
throughout the world and establish
a form of communist organization.

The Socialist party is censured for
its alleged tendency to support com
munistic propaganda and agitation in
this country. Unless the party takes
a stand against communists and radi
cal elements, it was stated the fed
eration will be inclined to regard it
as an enemy of organized labor.

200 in Attacking Party!
Capt. J. L. Brockus, commander of
the state police for this district, who
returned to Williamson tonight, said
that the shooting had been general
from Williamson to McCarr, Ky., a
distance of about 15 miles. He esti
mated that no less than 200 men
made up the attacking parties. Bul
lets fairly rained from the mountain
side as, he said, some of the at
tackers were using automatic rifles.
These were met by four or five ma
chine guns which the state police
had stationed in the valley.

So heavy was the firing from the
Kentucky side that the state police
replied and just before nightfall, ac
cording to reports, hidden men near
McCarr shouted to their friends
across the river that one of the
number had been killed.

It was also reported to headquarters
that the H. C. Frick coke company,
subsidiary of the United States Steel
corporation, had been active in the
region.

A statement from the governor's office tonight de
clared that "the greater amount of the firing came
from the Kentucky side," adding that reports to the
state's chief executive were to the effect that two men
had been killed.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., May 12. Federal troops at
Camp Sherman, Ohio, are being held ready to depart
for Mingo county, W. Va., it was announced tonight
at Fifth army corps headquarters at Fort Harrison, Ind.

Situation Beyond Control
WILLIAMSON, W. Va., May 12

Guerrilla warfare was being waged
tonight in the mountains of the strike
regions of the Mingo county coal district.

Beginning soon after daylight this
morning shots were poured from the
mountainside into Merrimac, Rawl,
Sprig and Matewan, W. Va., and Mc
Carr, Ky.

All available state police and dep
uty sheriffs centered in Williamson
were rushed to the scene, but ac
cording to reports, they have been
unable to check the shooting.
Prohibition Officer Slain

Harry C. Staten, state prohibition
officer and merchant at Spring, was
killed, and Noah Phillips and a young
man named Calvert at Merrimac were
seriously wounded during the shoot
ing. Rumors of other killings and
woundings have been received at
headquarters of the state police here.

Tonight, about 20 state policemen
were reported to be working their
way over the mountains between
Merrimac and Rawl, seeking to out
flank their hidden foe.

Today's outbreak, the worst since
the Matewan battle of last May 19,
in which 18 persons were killed, had
all the appearance of a pre-arranged
attack, according to accounts of the
fighting.
The towns under fire are within
seven miles of each other and lie in
a narrow valley on the banks of the
Tug river, which separates West Vir
ginia from Kentucky. The firing
came from the mountains on both
sides of the river, according to the
state police.

Towns Terrorized
They concentrated, therefore, in
the mountains on the West Virginia
side, while county officials here got
in touch with officials of Pike coun
ty, Kentucky, in an attempt to ob
tain co-operation in routing the at
tackers. Terror reigned in towns in the zone
of firing at nightfall and it was
learned that the authorities had
failed to apprehend any of the at
tackers. Virtually all lights were ex
tinguished tonight and residents kept
close under cover. The state police
were virtually helpless during the
day as the attacking forces in the
mountains were screened by foliage
and boulders, while the police, in or
der to attempt a direct attack, would
have been obliged to cross the open
valley and climb the rugged slopes in
face of the hidden marksmen.

RAIL EARNINGS SHOW
SURPLUS FOR MARCH;
FIRST SINCE JANUARY

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, May 12. During a
long cross-examination before the
interstate commerce committee today,
Julius Kruttschnitt, chairman of the
board of the Southern Pacific, held
firmly to the views he had given in
direct testimony as to the causes of
the financial plight of the railroads.
Expenditures for labor, fixed par
tially or wholly by government action,
are too high and must be reduced, he
reiterated in reply to questions.
Present revenues affected by recent
rate advances are justifiable, he add
ed, and must be sustained.
Arguments and inquiries by sena
tors designed to bring out the views
of the witness as to whether lower
freight rates might bring the roads
more business and increase profits
out of smaller tolls, met not the
slightest encouragement. In reply to
the suggestion of Senator Townsend
of Michigan that railroads might gain
popular favor by dealing with rate
reductions and wage reductions at the
same time, the witness retorted that
the railroads are almost in the death
throes.
Senator Poindexter, Washington,
said many complaints were being
voiced because of the slowness of ac
tion of the railroad labor board in
deciding complaints and Mr. Krutt
schnitt agreed that this was a dif
ferent factor.

Reports from the fighting area at
10 o'clock were that the firing on
Sprig, Matewan and Merrimac had
died down, but was continuing from
the vicinity of McCarr. Captain
Brockus scattered his 40 men among
the towns on the West Virginia side
and said he would do nothing fur
ther until morning.
