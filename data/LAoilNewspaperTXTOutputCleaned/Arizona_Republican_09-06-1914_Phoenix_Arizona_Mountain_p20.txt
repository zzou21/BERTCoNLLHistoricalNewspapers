THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 6, 1914

THE MONITOR
DOUBLE DISC DRILL
As shown in cut above the tube passes through the opening in
the boot in front of the standard, thereby necessitating the
dropping of the seed in front of the bearing with the down
ward turn of the discs. The discs therefore aid to carry the
seed to the bottom of the furrow, where it is all deposited at
a uniform depth and covered with an even amount of earth.
All other double discs are obliged to drop the seed BACK of
the bearing, therefore it falls meeting the upward turn of the
discs, which tends to lift and scatter the seed, making it im
possible to deposit the seed at a uniform depth and cover it
with an even amount of earth.
