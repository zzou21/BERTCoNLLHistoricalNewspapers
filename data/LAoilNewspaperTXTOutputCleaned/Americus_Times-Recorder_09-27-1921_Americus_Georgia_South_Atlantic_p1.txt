GRADE CROSSING
PROBLEM FIRST
FOR RAILROADS
Most Important Of All Accident
Questions, Says Vice Presi-
dent Of B. & O.
CARELESSNESS GROWS
AS AUTOS INCREASE
Railroad Official Tells Safety
Congress Of Efforts To
Abate Accidents
The following address on rail-
road grade crossings before the Na-
tional Safety Council today by an
official of a great railroad system
is of timely interest in Americus
following a grade crossing accident
in this city Monday in which two
lives were lost.
BOSTON, Sept. 27.—(By Asso-
ciated Press.) —Automobile accidents
at grade crossings is the most im-
portant of all accident questions that
confront the railroads of the country
at the present time, C. W. Galloway,
vice-president of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad told the Steam Rail-
road section of the tenth annual con-
gress of the National Safety Council
here today.
“It is now necessary for engineers
to consider all construction from the
standpoint of safe operation,” Mr.
Galloway said. “Even before the hu-
man element enters a plant, science
has done its part to make conditions
safe and sanitary. This came about
primarily, because of economic ne-
cessity.
“I have watched the progress of
the safety work on the Baltimore and
Ohio particularly, for many years and
it is with no little pride that I point
to some of the accomplishments for
employees totaled 9,650 in 1920 the
casualties among employees totaled
694, or a decrease in casualties
of 28 per cent. In 1915 the gross
ton-mileage was 40,807,502,000, or an increase of 20
per cent. That means that in 1920,
compared with 1915, the increase in
train mileage, both freight and pas-
senger was 13 per cent, and at the
same time our casualties decreased
by 8 per cent.
10,000,000 Autos Now.
“With each recurring year the in-
crease in the number of automobiles
and the growing carelessness of the
drivers make it very important that
we devote some extraordinary effort
to lessen accidents at grade crossings.
We are confronted with the fact that
there are ten million motor vehicles
now in use in the United States.
“It was with alarm that I noticed
the reports of grade crossing acci-
dents showing increases month by
month in 1919, and I determined to
apply a remedy. I felt that if the
drivers of cars could be reached in-
timately they would heed warnings.
We started the campaign by placing
observers at a few crossings where
travel was heavy. When the observ-
ers noticed the driver of an automo-
bile approach the crossing and dash
over it without taking any precau-
tionary measures to assure himself
that there was no train coming, the
license number of the machine was
taken and the card. These cars were
warded to automobile commissioners
according to the state which issued
licenses. The commissioners forwarded
the cards to the owners of the machines.
“These cards, after reciting the
facts of the observation, warned the
owners of automobiles that their
lives and property had been
endangered unnecessarily, and that a
further infraction might bring disaster. In
the great majority of cases, the re-
cipient of the card realized that he
had been careless and a great many
even wrote their appreciation of our
efforts to save them from injury.
There was a gradually declining per-
centage of failures to take precautions.
A few Look and Listen.
When we inaugurated the obser-
vation plan, we found that 81 per
cent of automobiles failed to take
proper precautions when crossing our
tracks. In the three months of No-
vember, December, 1919, January,
we made 1,933 observations
and there was a total of 484 failures
to take safety precautions, or 25 per
cent.
During the year of 1920, we ex-
tended our observations. In the 12
months of that year there were 49,-
observations with 8,230 failures,
or 10 per cent.
In 1921, our observers became
more active and in the first six
months of this year, there were 24,385
observations made, and the fail-
ures reached only 8,775 or 3 1/2 per
cent.
The result of our observation
plan has caused us to have printed more
than 1,000,000 warning leaflets,
showing on one side a boy warning
an automobile to stop before he cross-
ed a track. On the reverse side is
a photograph of a machine reduced
to splinters when struck by a train
at a crossing. We arranged to send
an extra leaflet in mail that would
reach the autoist. It was found that
every business house appealed to
readily consented to co-operate in the

YOU AND I
WORRY ABOUT THE U. S.
NATIONAL DEBT, YET IN
INTEREST ON IT IS ONLY :
$8.65 A YEAR FOR EACH \
OF US.

We shiver when our national
debt is mentioned. It is about
$20,000,000,000. A huge sum. Yet
the interest on it is only $8.65 a year
for each of us.
So with all our other national
problems. They look enormous, dis-
heartening on the surface. But
there’s an enormous nation under
our flag to share the burden.
We pay $8.65 a year each, to car-
ry our debt. Austria pays $106.77.
Germany $41.61 (not counting in-
demnity), France, $47.76. England
$36.45. Those seem large, yet small
enough to be handled. Europe can
come back financially—if it keeps
its head, works hard and has sound
leaders.
OBJECTS
Prominent Los Angeles man ob-
jects to the statement that the movies
made Los Angeles. He says it can be
proved on paper, and just as accu-
rately, that oil made Los Angeles—or
autos, or any one of a dozen things.
“Climate made Los Angeles,” he
concludes. “The developments giv-
ing it 600,000 population were due
to climate and nothing else. In a
comparatively few years Los Ange-
les will be the third largest city in
the country.”
The thing that really makes any
town is its people.
LIVING
Jobless men walk the streets of
many a city looking for a living while
out in the country a living is look-
ing for the men.
Near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada,
a hired man named Williamson
rented an engine and plowing outfit
on an acreage basis. With the
profits from one season’s plowing,
he bought an irrigated farm of 80
acres and broke it. Now, after
three years, he owns farm, thresh-
ing and plowing outfit and tractor,
all fully paid for. He’s independent.
Laughs at hard times.
Nature will give us all a living
if we will give her half a chance.
WOLF
The colder the winter is going to
be, the more nuts you'll find a squir-
rel storing away. Squirrel doesn’t
take any chances. But humans do, es-
pecially Americans.
The Treasury Department says
that the average American has only
$250 savings. That’s a mighty thin
door to build against the wolf. Nor-
mally ours is a very prosperous
country. That lulls us into a false
feeling of security. Probably we’d
soon stop saving altogether, if we
didn’t have periodic hard times to
jolt us to our senses.
POWER
The cylinder head of a refrigerat-
ing machine blows out in New York.
Ammonia fumes spread through the
neighborhood and knocks 60 people
unconscious.
Civilized man is remarkable in the
way he cages death, making it work
for him. Among the death-dealing de-
vices we have imprisoned are fire,
chemicals, gas and electricity.
A million volts of electricity is
enough to kill millions of people. Yet
Steinmetz imprisons that power in a
copper wire, sends it 1,000 miles and
produces a 15-foot electric spark at
the other end. Talk about imprison-
ing death!
DISASTER
Señors Tapia and Kopellmann, Ar-
gentine geologists, sailed toward the
South Pole to make observations.
Tapia fell into a deep crevice of
ice. Rescued, hours later, gangrene
started in his frozen fingers. To
save his life, Kopellmann took scis-
sors and cut off all of Tapia’s fingers,
No anesthetic. As Kopellmann
cut, he interspersed the Lord’s
Prayer with words of comfort: “Does
it pain you much, comrade? * * *
Hallowed be Thy Name * Courage
* * "Thy will be done, on earth * *
It is finished, comrade, it is finish-
ed.”
In disaster, prayer is man’s
most instinctive and only comfort.
EUROPE
Italy is in worse shape than any
other European country. Inflation of
prices, currency and wages is tre-
mendous and the people are spending
all they make, says Arthur Reynolds
Chicago banker, just returned from
abroad.
Reynolds says the Belgians are
working hard, have fine crops, and
are rebuilding rapidly. He found
French farmers frugal and industri-
ous, but French city and factory peo-
ple spending extravagantly and not
over-fond of labor.
Germany, says Reynolds, is work-
ing harder than any other European
country. She is producing goods at
a third the cost of other nations, and
her workmen are demanding longer
hours and more wages.
This looks as if Germany and Bel-
gium will recover first.
CALLED TO FUNERAL OF
HIS SOLDIER-HERO SON
George D. Deyo has been called to
his former home in Ohio to attend
the funeral of his son, Harold, who
was killed in France and whose body
has just been returned to the United
States.

NEW YORK, Sept. 27.—Further
enormous purchases of Liberty bonds
and Victory notes overshadowed all
other dealings on the stock ex-
change today. Almost all domestic war
flotations rose to the highest quota-
tions of the year, but the feature was
Victory 4 3/4s which advanced to 99
1/2. One lot of a million dollars
of this issue changed hands.
SPLENDID VIENNA
ROAD IS FINISHED
Dooly Completes 10-Mile
Stretch From Flint River Bridge
On Americus Route
Dooly county has just completed
its federal aid highway from Vienna
to the Flint bridge on the Am-
ericus road. This stretch of road is
ten miles in length, with a 34-foot
roadway. It is built to a perfect
grade with a sand, clay and gravel
topping and all waterways are built
of reinforced concrete.
This is considered one of the best
in the state, approximate cost being
about $44,000. The road was con-
structed by Dover & O’Shields, of
Montezuma, with federal and county
funds.
With 16 miles of splendid high-
way in Sumter county from Ameri-
cus to the bridge there is now a good
road all the way between this city
and Vienna.
LOWNDES HOG GROWERS
STABILIZE BY HOLDING
VALDOSTA, Sept. 27.—Represen-
tative hog producers from Lowndes
and adjoining counties, including a
number from Florida counties near-
by, have reached a definite decision
that they will hold their for n
more stable market and will urge
their neighbors to adopt a more sys-
tematic system of selling in order
that the market might not be run
down during the fall and winter.
Considerably more than two thou-
sand hogs, ready for the market,
were represented at a meeting held
here, owned by those who definitely
agreed to adopt and stand by sys-
tematic selling plans. Through the
summer the Cuban market afforded
an excellent market for the South
Georgia hogs, the prices paid for ex-
port being an average above two
cents above the packing house offer-
ings. Private speculators began buy-
ing hogs through the country and
shipping them to Florida points and
under bidding the South Georgia
markets with South Georgia hogs. In
some instances speculators bought
hogs in South Georgia and sold them
in regular sales making about two
cents extra over their original price.
CENT-A-MILE RATE TO
LEGION MEET GRANTED
NEW YORK, Sept. 26. A one
cent-a-mile rate, good in Pullmans
over all roads in the territory from
the Atlantic to the Mississippi river
and from the southern boundary of
the New England states to the Ohio,
has been granted for delegates and
visitors to the national convention of
the American Legion at Kansas City
Oct. 31, Nov. 1 and 2, according to
announcement made by W. W. After-
bury, vice-president of the Pennsyl-
vania railroad and member of the
Legion’s national executive commit-
tee. The rate has been made by
the Trunk Line Association of roads.
Railroads touching practically ev-
ery part of the United States now
have granted the reduced fare to the
Legion men and women, and the larg
est gathering of service persons since
demobilization of the American army
three years ago will greet Marshal
Foch and other war leaders at the
convention. Preparations are being
made to house 100,000 men and wo-
men at Kansas City, reports from
there show.
JOHNSON’S NAME
IS NOT YET REJECTED
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.—Sub
committee of the senate commit-
tee on the District of Columbia has not
rejected the nomination of Henry
Lincoln Johnson, Georgia negro to be
registrar of deeds in the District. Pre-
vious report to the contrary was er-
roneous.
Senator Ball, of Delaware, chair-
man of the committee, made state-
ment to the above effect to Senator
Harris of Georgia, Monday.
Both Senator Harris and Senator
Watson have vigorously opposed the
confirmation of the negro, but their
efforts have not yet been crowned
with success. The sub-committee will
meet when Senator Jones, of Wash-
ington its chairman, returns to the
capital, which will be the first week
in October, it is said at his office.

U. S. SUBMARINE
SINKS; 3 LOST
Unexplained Accident Sends The
R-6 To Bottom At San
Pedro
SAN PEDRO, Calif., Sept. 27.
Three men are believed to have lost
their lives when the U.S. submarine
R-6 sank in the outer harbor here
last night as the result of an unex-
plained accident, it was stated at the
submarine base here today.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 27.—Lieut.
I. R. Chambers, in command of sub-
marine R-6, is reported to have been
the last to make his escape from the
craft when it sank late last night in
the outer harbor of San Pedro with
the reported loss of two members of
the crew.
According to the story of witnesses,
the boat tied up at 6 o’clock last
night with two hawsers binding her
to three sister ships and two haw-
sers connecting the string of subma-
rines to the mother ship.
Prior to the disaster the entire
crew, it was said, was inside the hull
getting torpedoes ready for battle
practice.

SHERIFF KNEW HE HAD
TAG, SAYS SOLICITOR
“There is one funny thing about
that tag matter,” said Dan Chappell,
solicitor of the City court, in discuss-
ing the case made against him a few
days ago by Deputy Sheriff Kleck-
ley for driving his automobile with-
out a license tag, “and that is that
Sheriff Harvey knew all the time I
had a tag, had seen it, and knew that
it was under the rear seat. He call-
ed my attention to the fact a few
days before that I was about to lose
my tag. It had been fastened on
with a piece of wire and was com-
ing loose. Right then I took it off
and placed it under the seat, intend-
ing to get it fastened on later. It
has since been put in place,”

WHO’LL ADVANCE
VETS TRIP MONEY
ON DUE PENSIONS
A dozen old Confederate vet-
erans of Sumter county, who are
entitled to pensions but who have
not received them yet because of
lack of state funds and the hold
ing up of the pension warrant,
want to attend the reunion next
month in Chattanooga and want to
borrow money for the trip against
their overdue pensions. If any
citizens desires to advance this
money on this basis, the Times-Rc
corder will put them in touch with
the veterans in question. It is be
lieved the pension money will be
forthcoming very shortly, but it is '
not certain it will arrive in time to
make reunion plans. The money
should be in the hands of the vet-
erans for their trip by October 15
at the latest.
WAYCROSS EATING
BEAR STEAK AFTER
CHASE IN SWAMP
WAYCROSS, Sept. 27.—A black
bear weighing between 300 and 400
pounds was killed in the Okefino-
kee swamp Monday morning by
Perry Barber.
This bear has given the stock
raisers in the vicinity of the swamp
a great deal of trouble for a long
time, and has probably crippled up
more dogs than any bear ever kill-
ed in this section.
About 2 a. m. Robert Pittman
heard one of his pigs squeal and
while he knew what the trouble
was he didn’t make an investiga-
tion until daylight, when he found
that one of his hogs, weighing
about 150 pounds had been killed
and carried several hundred yards
into the woods. He immediately
got in touch with Mr. Barber, who
keeps a pack of fine, well trained
bear hounds, and in a short time
the chase had begun.
The bear was overtaken after a
chase of nearly two miles into the
swamp. Although he was shot five
times with an automatic loaded
with buckshot, it was necessary to
cut his throat with a knife before
he was stopped from fighting the
dogs.
Mr. Barber is the son of the late
Obediah Barber, better known as
the “King of Okcfinokec” and has
killed more bears than any
man in this section if not the en-
tire United States.
The bear steak was put on sale
at Janie’s Tatum’s market Mon-
day afternoon.
JAIL GUARDED AFTER
FATAL STILL BATTLE
SCOTTSBORO, Ala., Sept. 27.
The strong guard placed about the
county jail last night when Effie
Talley, a negro, who was brought
here after Deputy Sheriff Edward
Kirby had been killed and Deputy
J. N. Owens wounded in a battle with
alleged moonshiners, was continued
today.
Three white men and two negroes
were arrested also and brought to jail
here. Talley is held on a charge of
murder.

MINER SHUTS OFF
KANSAS DEBATE
Put End to 4-Day Discussion Of
Cases—Howatt Forces Them
Win Roll Call
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 27.—By
overwhelming vote further debate on
the Kansas strike cases, that have
been before the convention of Unit-
ed Mine Workers of America for four
days, was shut off soon after the con-
vention opened today.
Supporters of Alexander Howatt,
president of the Kansas district, then
won a roll call vote. It was expected
most of the day would be necessary
for the roll call.
DEMOCRATS NOT
TO FIGHT PACTS
Decide In Conference Ratification
Is Individual, Not Party,
Matter
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.—Demo-
cratic senators in Conference today
decided that the peace treaties with
Germany, Austria and Hungary were
not matters for party action. The
individual Democrats, it was said,
will be left to follow their own judg-
ment in voting on ratification.
SUITER OFFICER’S HONOR
WRONGLY GIVEN ANOTHER
The Atlanta Journal, in a photo-
graph published a few days ago,
awards an honor to another belong-
ing rightfully to a Sumter county
man. The picture was of Judge J.
T. C. Williams, aged 80, ordinary of
Harris county, and Judge Clarke Ed-
wards, aged 23, ordinary of Elbert
county. The statement was made
that these were the oldest and young-
est ordinaries in Georgia.
The Journal’s error lay in the fact
that Sumter county’s ordinary, Judge
John A. Folsom, has Judge Williams
beaten by about three years, being 83
years of age. Captain Cobb per-
forms the duties of his office with
efficiency, despite his age.
PHYSICIAN KILLS SELF
LEAPING FROM ROOF
MOLENA, Sept. 27.—Dr. J. H.
Morgan, of Molena, committed sui-
cide Monday by leaping from the
roof of his residence, it is thought,
as he was suffering from a nervous
breakdown and no other cause can
be attributed for the act.
Dr. Morgan was fifty-one years
of age and was a first honor graduate
of the Atlanta Medical college, class
of 1891. He is survived by his wife,
Mrs. Willie B. Morgan, past worthy
grand matron of the Order of the
Eastern Star, of Georgia; two daugb.
ters, Ruth and Florence; two sons, T
T. and Vincent; one daughter, Mrs. Ila
McIntosh of Des Moines, Ia.; one
brother, W. A. Morgan, of Waycross,

LABOR AVERSE
TO WORKING AT
LOWERED RATE
Official Of Massachusetts Labor
Department Testifies Before
National Inquiry
75,000 EX-SERVICE MEN
IDLE IN NEW YORK CITY
So Says Their Employment Chief
—Favors Camp Vocational
Training Schools
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. The
aversion of labor to accepting work
at reduced wages was assigned as the
cause of some unemployment by
Roswell Phelps, director of labor sta-
tistics for the Massachusetts labor de-
partment, the first witness heard by
the national unemployment confer-
ence committee on statistics, which
set to work today to determine the
extent and volume of the nation’s
involuntary idle.
Harry Jacobs, president of the J
Ex-Service Men’s Employment Bureau,
of New York City, estimated there
were 75,000 unemployed former sol-
diers in New York City, and said the
establishment of vocational training
schools in army camps, as proposed
by the government, would solve the
unemployment problem, so far as un
skilled World War veterans was con-
cerned.
The national conference, called by
President Harding, organized and
yesterday and adjourned until Oc-
tober 5, at which time ten subcommit-
tees will present suggestions for
emergency relief.
WATSON DENIES HE
IS MEMBER OF KLAN
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.—Sen-
ator Watson, of Georgia, indignantly a
denies that he is king of the Ku Klux Klan or that, he had a seat near the J|
Imperial Kleagle. He said:
“There is no truth whatever
for the published charge that I am
king of the Ku Klux Klan. I am not
a member of the Klan. I am not a
member of any secret organization
except the Junior Order of the Unit-
ed American Mechanics.”
GAINESVILLE NORTHERN
ASKS FOR $75,000
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. The

ing indebtedness.
2000-LB. BOMB ENDS
OLD ALABAMA’S CAREER
NORFOLK, Va., Sept. 26.—A two
thousand pound bomb ended the career of
the battleship Alabama shortly after
noon today. The bomb turned her
over on her side and other bombs
struck her as she went down.
MARKETS
The cotton market was boosted up-
ward materially today under pro-
nounced strength from various quar-
ters and a good Liverpool market. To-
day was delivery day for October cot-
ton on the exchanges, and there was
lively bidding for the actual by short
interests, with the holders reluctant
to let go and forcing the price up a
cent a pound.
Spots here were up a half cent to
20 cents and sales of 175 bales, worth
$17,500, were reported to noon.
