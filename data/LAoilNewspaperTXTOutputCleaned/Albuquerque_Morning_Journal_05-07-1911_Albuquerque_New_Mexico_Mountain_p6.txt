Eminent Brother,

Silver City, N. M., May 6. Silver

City lodge No. 8, A. F. & A. M.. has
adopted the following resolution on

tho death of Judge Arthur II. Ilarl-

lee, a distinguished lawyer of New
Mexico, who died' March 25 last.

We, your committee heretofore, ap

pointed to prepare resolutions of re
spert to the memory of our deceased

brother, Arthur J I. Harllee, who was,
by the supremo architect of the uni
verse, called, on March 25, 1911, from

labor on earth "to that temple, not

made with hands, eternal in the

heavens, beg leave to submit the fol

lowing:

Uesolved, That this lodge has re
clved with the deepest regret In for

mation of the death of our brother.

Arthur II. Harllee;

Uesolved, Further. That we, his

surviving brethren, fully appreciating
ami recognizing his unswerving de
votion to the principles of the 'frater

nity or which he was an honored
member, deem It appropriate that
brief mention bo here made of his
distinguished record as n Mason:

Arthur H. llarlbe received the de

grees as a master Mason In Jet tries
lodge No. 4., A. F. & A. M at Mar
lon, South Carolina, In 1871; became
a member of Silver City lodge No. 8,
A. F. & A. M., by affiliation, le
ccnibor 13, 1882, and afterwards, In

1882, ably served as Its worshipful
master; was made a roynl arch Ma

son tn silver city chapter .no. 18-

A. M., in 1883, of whl. h he was past

high priest; took the degrees of Mc-

Croty Commandcry No. 4. at Dom

inguez, N. M., in 1884 and later became
a charier member of Alaltiv Comman
dcrv No. 7, of which h was a past
eminent commander, lie was elected
most worshipful grand master of the

most worshipful grand lodge. A

A. M.. of New Mexico. October 31,

1901, and served with distinction for
thu ensuing year, ami was. during the
year 1902, grand commander of the
grand comniatidery of Knights Tcm
hir of New Mexico,
The character of our deceased
brother was as the open day neith
er darkness nor shadow rested upon
it; nothing hidden that should he re
vealed; nothing concealed that should
be known; his conduct was ever Just
ami honorable; tho dignity of his
manhood spurned nil that was mean
and worth less; and bis virtues lent a
charm of manlier that gave him pre
eminence; his Integrity and good
Judgment were tho bnsia of a repu
tatlon for nhlllfy. honor, charity and
Justice, which every one who knew
him ipikkly recognised. His loyalt
to truth, his fealty to duty, his warm
devotion to the principles of our or

der, have curved far Into the hearts

of his brethren nn enduring tahh't.
While w mourn his untimely de

partuie. we humbly bow to the will

ol' the Almighty and look to that life

and light be ond the grave to the

great fact of Immortality and com

lorted by these reflections, we ran
say to our departed brother: "Hall

ami farewell."

The lessons of his life, whose pleas

ant remembrance rob even death of

Its sadness, let. us treasure, hiii may

they ever prove a stimulating liillu
one,, In the conduct of our own.
Wherefore, lie it Further ltesolved.
(McMuhon'sl 18-year-old diuigh
