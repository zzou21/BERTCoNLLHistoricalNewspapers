Lodging for Homeless Poor
Gen Booth wishes the lord mayor to
take a leaf out of the book of the Paris
municipality and fit up or allow the
Salvation Army to fit up any building
or buildings such as may be under the
control of the corporation to serve as a
night shelter during the bitter weather
for those whose sleeping place is the
open street and whose hearth is the cold
stone pavement of our bridges. If the
lord mayor will thus provide beds for
outcast London the general will do something
in the way of board.
Sure before the city fathers are asked to make a dormitory of the Guild
hall the city churches ought to take the
first step. If there were mattresses in
the pews and shakedown along the
aisles the edifices would be serving a
good many more of those for whom they
were built than they see anything of at
present either by day or night and the
idea would not sit so badly with Chris
tianity whether it tallied with political
economy or not. In France they are
just voting $50,000 to relieve the distress
in large towns and are about to do the
same by country districts. Pall Mall

A Queer Old Lady
Mrs Jane McKeene is an old lady in
Lewiston who was recently taken to the
insane asylum. Had been very eccentric
for years while working in the cotton
mills and a number of stories are told
of her peculiarities. At one time she
had a lot of cockroaches in a box near
her room which she would feed regu
larly every day. Whether they ate the
food provided them by their benefactress
is not known but she took good care of
them and they increased in numbers un
til at last the superintendent discovered
them and had them removed.
The old lady cried bitterly that her
pets and whoever had such pets before
were removed. They say she used to
drop a silver coin in the canal each day
which she said went to feed her husband
and boy who were drowned at sea. Her
boy's clothes which she carried under
her arm she never parted with. Every
morning she took the bundle to her work
and each night returned with it. Bangor Me Commercial
The Uncertainties of Fortunes
You never can tell said a gentleman when you have a good thing offered you in oil. I was offered the half
of the McGeagh six acres lease in the
Idlewood field for 5500. I was afraid
of it and refused to invest. Anybody
now with half an eye can see that I
made a great big mistake. The two
wells on the six acres came in at the
rate of about 500 barrels an hour and
my receipts for one day would have been
more than many men in Pittsburg make
in a year. Oil development is a great
gamble at best but I regret now that I
didn't gamble about 300 on that little
lease. Pittsburg Post
Alaska as a Fruit Section
Kodiak island Alaska is larger than
one of the New England states with a
climate similar to that of Maryland and
is capable of supporting a large agricul
tural population. It is claimed that a
part of the territory can be made a com
petitor of Oregon and Washington in the
raising of the more hardy fruits such as
apples and cherries. The next steamer
sailing for Sitka will carry in her cargo
a large consignment of young apple trees.
San Francisco Chronicle
The Oak and the Oyster
Tall oaks from little acorns grow.
In the specimen shown us by Mr George
W Cruikshank the little oak tree was
growing right through the heart of an
oyster shell. Whether the sprouting
grain had pierced the shell or some acci
dental hand had bored the convenient orifi
ce through which it might sprout the
deponent saith not. But certain it is the
sturdy little oak had penetrated the crust
of the impeding bivalve. Cecil Md

Smallpox Returns for Last Year
The most notable disclosure in the
mortality returns of the past year con
cerns smallpox. Whether Dr Jennerbo
riat or not is a point upon which vac
cinators and anti vaccinaters will probably never be brought to agree but the
fact remains that in the big towns only
ten deaths took place from smallpox in
the twelve months of which four were
among the 6,010,000 inhabitants of the
metropolis. London Tit Bits
Just Like a Boy
A gentleman of this city had placed a
ladder against the eaves of his house for
the purpose of cleaning the snow from
the roof and was horrified a short time
after to find his 5-year-old boy had
climbed up and was sitting on the upper
round monarch of all he surveyed. The
father climbed up very cautiously to
take him down when the little fellow
exclaimed Don't fall pa don't fall.

Gad Fly Grubs
In early spring by running the hand
over the backs of cattle lumps will
nearly always be felt in the skin about
the size of a small marble. In those are
the maggots or larvæ of the gad fly of
the ox or warble fly. Hence the lumps
are called warbles. The skin gad fly of
the ox lays her eggs in the skin of cattle
in June and July which soon hatch out
minute footless grubs which grow fast
and eventually reach the size of a very
large kidney bean reaching its growth
the next May or June when it pops out
falls to the ground into which it bur
rows and then soon emerges as a gad
fly. The larvæ when in the animal is
just beneath the outside skin where its
constant wriggling causes irritation
and pain to the animal and when there
are many in the same animal they great
ly reduce its thrift also injure the value
of its hide and the meat under it.
At the top of a warble lump will al
ways be found a round hole through
which the larva breathes. If this hole
is permanently stopped up the larvæ
soon suffocate. The remedy then is
to take a quart of lard and an ounce of
resin, melt them together then when
nearly cold stir in a tablespoonful of
kerosene. Then put a bunch of this
salve on each lump. If this is done in
autumn no injury will result or it may
be done in early spring and kill the larvae
but in this case they have been in
juring the animal all winter. They
may be squeezed out at any time by
strong pressure on each side by the two
thumbs. If this is done in the spring
the larva should be mashed.
This is an European insect imported
into this country in live stock and in England and good authorities
in this country estimate that the dam
age done by this gad fly equals 5 on
every head of mature cattle by injury
to the thrift hides beef and milk pro
duction. They estimate that it decreases
the milk production from one tenth to
one fourth. Therefore warbles are very
poor stock to feed on the farm and great
pains should be taken to destroy every
one of them so soon as they can be felt
in the skin. Cows may be found with
fifty or more of these great slugs in
their backs.

Sheep Scab
What is commonly called sheep scab
and regarded as a disease is in reality a
louse which burrows under the skin. It
is quite common on the coast. A simple
and efficient remedy for the evil as well
as ticks and foot rot is crude petroleum
not crude machine oil but the sub
stance from which the best grade of
kerosene is made. The best Los Angeles
county natural coal oil would probably
be good in the shape in which it is
shipped for refining. The Eastern natu
ral petroleum has always proven effect
ive if rightly and thoroughly applied. It
should be applied in the following man
ner. As soon as the spring rains are
over shear the sheep as closely as possi
ble. As fast as sheared stand them in
a tub in which there is a few inches of
crude petroleum. A few pounds of best
flour of sulphur would be a valuable ad
dition. Take a rag swab and thorough
ly saturate every particle of the sheep's
skin from tip of nose to hoofs then
with stiff bristle scrubbing brushes rub
the skin all over especially the scabs
until they are thoroughly broken up.
Be sure and saturate the under parts
and in the forks of the legs and then
amount with the oil again. Rub it off
with the hands so as not to waste too
much oil and let the sheep go. If the
oil is right there will be no more scab
or ticks on your flock until again con
taminated.
The Foot of a Horse
The foot of a horse is one of the most
ingenious and unexampled pieces of
mechanism in animal structure. The
hoof contains a series of vertical and
thin laminae of horn amounting to
about 600 and forming a complete lin
ing to it. In this are fitted as many lam
inae belonging to the Coffin bone while
both sets are elastic and adherent. The
edge of a quire of paper inserted leaf
by leaf into another will convey a suffi
cient idea of the arrangement. Thus
the weight of the animal is supported
by as many elastic springs as there are
lamina in all the feet amounting to
about four thousand distributed in the
most secure manner since every spring
is acted upon in an oblique direction.
Exchange
Gallantry of the Sioux
A correspondent who has just returned
from Pine Ridge agency tells a story of
the visiting Sioux Indians who are now
in Washington.
Reading of the reception the Indians
received in church Sunday and the fact
that they attended the theatre Monday
evening recalls a funny incident that
happened when they were in Chicago en
route to Washington. The manager who
has charge of the visiting Indians
thought he would amuse them by taking

them to the theatre in the evening. He

never for a moment thought that tragedy
would rouse the warlike nature of
which the Sioux is so abundantly en

dowed. Well he got them into several
boxes all right and everything went

well until the third act.
The play was a heavy tragedy and
in this act the heroine was to be killed.
The minute the villain attempted to
strike the woman with a knife three of
the Sioux rose from their seats and act
ually prepared to leap over the boxes
onto the stage for the purpose of rescu
ing the heroine. The theatre was soon
in an uproar and it was only by remov
ing the three refractory Indians from the
theatre that the actors could proceed.
That also explains why they were taken
to see a light opera in Washington.
Philadelphia Press
Russia's Watchful Eye
There was a meeting of representative
railroad men and steamship managers in
St Petersburg to discuss the feasibility
of introducing round trip tickets in
the interior of Russia. Such tickets
would be of great benefit to those who
have business in the Volga district and
make short trips from one city to an
other by the steamers on that river and
also to excursionists along the railroad
lines. But this measure is discounten
anced by the police authorities.
At present there is an officer stationed
by every ticket office who may examine
the passports of the traveler without
whose permission no ticket can be sold.
But if round trip tickets should be is
sued the holder of a return ticket to any
place may sell it to another person and
the police would be unable to keep its
eye on the traveling public. Exchange

THE ARIZONA SUGAR COMPANY

THE ARIZONA

SUGAR COMPANY

THE EXCEPTIONAL INDUCEMENTS OFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT

of the United States and the Territory of Arizona for the cultivation of Sugar
Beets and the manufacture of domestic Sugars have encouraged the undersigned
to organize a company under the general incorporation laws of the Territory of
Arizona styled

The capital stock of the company is
one hundred thousand 100000 shares
at ten 10 dollars each
One half of the capital stock will be
paid in the Territory of Arizona payable
in land and adapted to the cultivation of
sugar beets sugarcane sorghum and sac
charine products at the market price.
The other half will be sold for cash at
not less than par for the purpose of pur
chasing importing and erecting machin
ery adapted to manufacturing domestic
sugar.
The fifty thousand shares reserved for
the farmers can be paid for at any time
within five years from the date of the
organization in land or its saccharine
productions such as sugar beets sugar
cane sorghum etc etc and the sub
scribers will be entitled to draw a divi
dend pro rata on payments made.
The fifty thousand cash shares must
be fully paid on delivery and will be
entitled to a full dividend semi annually.
It is reasonably expected that the
company can declare a dividend of 25
per cent per annum on current business
and have some land left.
After the capital stock shall have been
disposed of and one half fully paid in
cash the company will be authorized to
issue bonds to one half of the capital
stock secured by mortgage upon
all the property of the company pay
able in twenty years with interest at
the rate of 5 percentum per annum
payable semi annually for the purpose
of devoting the proceeds to the purchase
of land and for no other purpose pro
vided always that these bonds cannot
be issued nor a mortgage on the prop
erty executed without the approval of a
majority of the shareholders.
The Government of the United States
offers to pay a bounty of two cents per
pound or 40 dollars per ton on domestic
manufactured sugar and to admit free
of duty until the first day of July 1902
all machinery required for its manu
facture.
The Territorial Legislature at its last
session passed an act exempting all
land used in the cultivation of sugar
beets as well as the plant and machinery
employed in the manufacture of do
mestic sugar from taxation for ten
years.
We imported from foreign countries
during the last fiscal year sugar mol
asses candy and confectionery to the
value of $12,123,820 or sent away u
wards of one hundred million dollars
which can be retained at home by en
couraging the manufacture of domestic
sugar.
The average yield of saccharine matter
from sugar beets in France is only 8 per
cent in Germany 10 per cent.
In California the average yield is 15
percent.
It is confidently believed that the soil
and sun of Arizona will yield a much
larger polarization from sugar beets
than France Germany California or any
other country and if these premises are
correct the profits will exceed that of any
other sugar factory in the United States.

The farmers who may subscribe to the
stock of the company will have a vital
and personal interest in the production
of sugar beets.
Farmers and capitalists can estimate
the chances of loss and gain as well as
the directors of the company but it may
be premised that agricultural land free
from taxation forms a safe investment
and that machinery which can be im
ported free of duty and enjoys immu
nity from taxation is only subject to
loss by fire which can be covered by
insurance.
Land in Arizona will produce at least
twenty tons of sugar beets per acre
twice annually.
The market price will depend upon
the quantity of saccharine.
Sugar beets require neither bagging
nor storage but are cash at the time and
the company might even be able to ad
vance money on unencumbered land de
voted to their cultivation.
It is a matter of consequence in some
parts of Arizona that sugar beets ex
tract alkali from the soil better than any
other production.
After supplying the home market in
Arizona with sugar molasses confections
etc transportation is the most
serious question and the smaller bulk
the production of the country can be
reduced into the better for the producer.
Sugar will bear transportation better
than hay grain or ores.
A sugar mill at some railway depot
with a capacity of 100 tons per day at
$2 per ton for sugar beets would be a
great benefit to the farmers and mer
chants of Arizona.
The cooperative system of offering the
farmers one half of the capital stock
payable in the productions required for
the mill has worked well in Germany
and France and in fact the cooperative
system in every country is the out
growth of civilization.
The farmers interest in the company
will be a guarantee to the non resident
shareholders of a vigilant watchfulness
over the management and by united ef
fort a staple production may be intro
duced in Arizona which will enliven the
source of all permanent prosperity.
AGRICULTURE
It is not to be overlooked that after the
saccharine matter is extracted from
sugar beets the residuum forms excellent
food for sheep cattle hogs poultry
etc and nothing that comes from the
soil is wasted.
The cultivation of sugar beets may be
carried on by the least intelligent labor.
Indians Mexicans children may all be
employed in transplanting the beets and
gathering the crop. Only the mill re
quires intelligent labor.
Sugar industries are being started in
many States of the Union less adapted
by nature to the growth of saccharine
products than Arizona and an effort on
the part of the residents may encourage
assistance from abroad.

The undersigned have no interest in the enterprise beyond
the promotion of the public welfare and submit the subject
for consideration.
Subscriptions will be received at the Valley Bank.
