A Christmas Story Of
Another Sort
The way of the transgressor
is hard. There is no path of
roses for the criminal. It is
thorny and rough and the farther one goes, the harder to
turn back. It’s easy—so easy
to start down that wrong road.
Youth ventures and at the end
there is an old man steeped in
crime.
An old man, his eyes moist
with tears, his voice choking
with emotion, stood before the
bar of justice this week in
Atlanta and pleaded with Judge
Holloway that he be allowed to
spend Christmas at home—to
spend his first Christmas in more
than 20 years outside prison
walls.
And the kindly heart of a
humane jurist was touched, and
—but read the story as it came
to us this week from the Asso-
ciated Press.
Fifty-five years old, and his
home in Richmond, Va., Wilkins
was brought to face the Recorder
on a charge of begging on the
public streets. The only reason
he could give to the Recorder
was that he was “hungry and
couldn’t find work.”
“Judge,” said the aged man,
as the tears came to his eyes,
“for the last twenty Christmases
I have been in jail, and I pray to
God that you won’t make me do
it again this year. You see, I
have just recently been released
from the stockade for being
drunk, and I know it’s liable to
go hard with me.”
Wilkins was pleading for an
other chance, one more, he said,
but more than all else, he wanted
to spend a Christmas Day with
out the thought of being a pris
oner—a danger to society, and
to the public. And he continued:
"I am a shoemaker by trade,
but I lost three fingers on my
left hand years ago, and
this has made me practically un
fit to do a creditable day’s work.
"I have served terms for bur
glary and for highway robbery
in Virginia, but when I was re
leased a few weeks ago I came
to Atlanta to start all over
again and re-make my life. But
I got completely down and out,
and—here I am.”
While he pleaded with the
judge, the prisoner held a pocket
testament in his hand, and per
haps he had read where all sin
ners, or those who had committed
wrong-doings, could be given
even another chance.
"In view of your statement,”
began the Recorder, “I’ll do
what I can for you. I sentence
you to the stockade until noon
of December 24th. But be care
ful not to come before me
again before Christmas or your
record of twenty years may not
be broken.”
And as a result of that plea,
the Judge felt touched perhaps,
and sentenced the defendant to
the city stockade until noon,
of December 24th.
Wilkins was given another
chance. What will he do with
it? Who knows? What would
you or I? Who knows? Who
can predict the end of that long
rough and thorny path. Better
never start. That’s easier than
trying to turn back.
Wilkins never thought he’d
come to such an end—others
might, but not he. That’s what
every youngster thinks when he
transgresses. But the end is
always the same.
Facts About
Georgia
Cobb County was created in
1832, and was named for John
Cobb. Marietta is the county
seat. The county comprises an
area of 353 square miles, with
a population of over 30,000. It
is in the 7th congressional dis
trict and the 39th senatorial
district. Blue Ridge is the
judicial circuit.
A total of 5,443,805 gallons
of turpentine was exported by
Georgia for the year ending
June 30, 1924. This amount
represents a total almost double
that of the State of Florida.
Those Long Hauls
We pay a thousand dollars to
haul a few barrels of flour
from Idaho to Sumter County.
And Georgia ships flour to
other states just as far away.
It costs $650 freight charges
to haul a carload of low-grade
lumber from the Pacific coast to
New York City.
This is typical of the “trans
portation problem”—the penal
ty for consumers living too far
from sources of production.
New York state used to grow
its own lumber. It still would
be, if forests had been conserved,
replanted systematically.
You have observed the ten
dency of industries to center
each in a special district of the
country. Shoes have been made
in and around Boston, autos
in Detroit, meat in Chicago,
steel in Pittsburgh. And so on.
All this is a part of our age
of specialization. Communities
or districts of the country are
getting so each has its own spec
ialty, just as each individual has
his “skilled line.”
Usually industries congregate
in particular sections because
there they are close to fuel sup
ply, near the raw materials they
need, or strategically situated
for distribution.
But when low-grade lumber is
hauled from the Pacific Coast
to New York which could make
its own, the cost of long-distance
transportation more than eats
up the savings due to specializa
tion by districts.
Yes, we are too far from
sources of production. That’s
the real "railroad problem."
The solution? It will shape it
self naturally, by economic evo
lution. The final result is dif
ficult to foresee. But there’s an
increasing tendency for districts
of the country to try to make
themselves self-supporting.
For instance, many can re
call when nearly all iron and
steel came from the Pittsburgh
district. Pittsburgh still is the
kingpin. But gigantic steel in
dustries are growing up at far
off points such as Gary and Bir
mingham.
Shoe-making used to be al
most monopolized by the Bos
ton district. Today shoes are
made everywhere.
The high cost of railroad
hauls is destined to break up the
industrial specialization by dis
tricts.
The high cost of railroad
hauls will compel us to
THINK, and thinking, learn to
live nearer home. Why pay
freight on Idaho flour when we
raise wheat and make flour in
Georgia? Why pay freight on
California oranges when we
have them just across the state
line?!

A crossword puzzle a day will not
keep insanity away.
In Salem, N. J., a man had the
hiccoughs for three days. We can’t
recall such an occurrence under a
Democratic administration.
Maybe this Salem man who hic
coughed three days mistook himself
for a flivver trying to start on a
cold morning.
Fort Worth, Tex., auto victim was
put in an ambulance and it wreck

Here’s news that will tickle the

News from Paris. Prize is offered
for the funniest clown. Nobody

The funniest clown in the world,
in our opinion, is the man who takes
life too seriously.

Kentucky University has adopted

Perhaps Kentucky University's
deciding to teach crossword puzzles
is the first effort to make them un
popular among students.

OLD DAYS IN AMERICUS

TEN YEARS AGO TODAY
(From The Times Recorder, Dec.
11, 1914.)
Americus cotton factors continue
discussing the cotton crop situation,
emphasized by the bureau estimate
of a crop this year near seventeen
million bales, the greatest cotton
crop ever grown. Had such an es
timate come in a normal market
there is hardly a doubt that a break
of 50 to 100 points would have
sued.
The railroad commission of Geor
gia has granted the petition of the
Seaboard railroad to discontinue
trains Nos. 13 and 11 between Am
ericus and the Alabama state line.
The petition of the railroad was
hotly contested by the Americus
chamber of commerce, but the com-
missioners saw fit to decide in favor
of the railroad.
Dear Santa Claus; I am a little
girl 5 years old, I want you to
bring me a stove, doll carriage, doll,
doll clothes, and some nuts and
fruit. Don’t forget my little sister
and brother. Your friend, Edith
Bahnsen.
Major and Mrs. James W. Furlow
will not come home for the holidays
as they had anticipated, Major Fur
low being still detained at Galves
ton by virtue of his official duties.
TWENTY YEARS AGO TODAY
Monday, no paper published.
THIRTY YEARS AGO TODAY
(From The Times-Recorder, Dec.
11, 1894.)
Mrs. L. B. Sasser, especially in
vites the ladies to call at her rooms
today in the Barlow block. She will
keep open from ten until four, and
will give free exhibitions of pattern
cutting.
Mr. H. W. Smithwick lost two
fine guns recently at the hands of a
slick stranger, who hired them for
a day’s hunt. He obligingly paid
the cost in advance but “he never
came back” with the guns.
Phil Catchings is not arranging
a Christmas tree exactly, but he has
a choice assortment of the best
Christmas goods in the way of fine
liquors, and cigars ever shown in
Americus.
At a conference of the member
ship of the Baptist church on Sun
day morning Rev. J. L. Ross was
chosen pastor to succeed Rev. A. B.
Campbell, who resigned some
months since to accept the pastorate
of Tatnall Square Baptist church,
Macon.
Three charcoal girls, Kate Smith,
Minnie Ford and Genie Cooper,
along with a gang of bucks, made
up a fragrant bouquet of rosebuds
that ornamented the bridal chamber
at the barracks yesterday. Christmas
whiskey did it.
At the home of the bride’s parents
in Troy, Ala., on Sunday evening,
Miss Louise Hollis, pretty belle
of that city was married to Mr.
Arthur Simmons, formerly of Am
ericus.
The work in the office of
Secretary of State since the
adoption of the Constitution of
1877, is said to have increased
ten-fold. The secretary is re
quired to consolidate election
returns in all state elections, and
certify the same to the Governor,
or the Legislature, as the
case may be. He is allowed an
allowance of $1,000 for clerk
hire, which is furnished by the
state treasury.
The first Memorial Day in
Georgia was held in Columbus.

THE AMERICUS TIMES-RECORDER

I PANAMA
The Panama Canal made a net
profit of more than six million dol
lars in the fiscal year ended last
June 30, it’s announced.
In addition, the public gains the
additional advantage that the canal
doubles the efficiency of our navy.
That was the original intention, the
chief reason for digging at Panama.
It was the biggest and wisest con
structive job ever handled by Uncle
Sam.
HELIUM
Another big helium gas well is
flowing in Texas. This, as you
know, is the gas ideal for balloon
type airships because it doesn’t
burn or explode.
Gas men used to curse when their
drills struck helium. They thought
it useless. But nothing is useless.
Helium, up to 1917, cost as much as
$2500 a cubic foot. We have it un
derground in six states, and the cost
soon will be about 3 cents a cubic
foot. No other country has a known
deposit of helium worth developing.
Quite logical for Zeppelin-making
headquarters to move to America.
TREES
Our forests in America now have
745 billion cubic feet of timber. The
nation uses 25 billion cubic feet a
year. So our forest reserve is not
more than enough to last 30 years.
New trees must be planted by the
millions, not sporadically but con
stantly, the same as yearly we plant
fresh crops of grains and cotton.
Trees should be grown as a crop.
DEBT
American farmers owe mortgages
and other debts totaling 14 billion
dollars, the National Grange esti
mates.
To pay interest on this must ab
sorb about a billion dollars a year,
or more, of the farmers’ income.
It’s a big burden. But we doubt
if it’s as bad as the debts carried by
city people, including mortgages on
homes—which correspond to mort
gages on farms.
CURSE
Debt is the curse of any country.
Farmers owe 14 billion dollars, city
people that much or more.
Uncle Sam owes more than a
score of billions. States, cities and
counties owe about half as much.
Ninety-five per cent of autos are
said to be bought “on time.” Nearly
every individual has a collector af
ter him, regularly or occasionally.
The only consolation is that so
many have gone into debt as a cold
ly calculated way of getting funds
to invest.
FARM
Though farmers owe 14 billion
dollars, less than five billion of
this represents mortgages or the ac
tual farms.
There isn’t any better security.
Land, in the long run is the only
enduring wealth. Gradually it ab
sorbs all other wealth. Unfortunate
ly for producers, unimproved land
held for speculative purposes does a
considerable part of the absorbing.

A MEDICINE
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE BEST
Have you ever stopped to reason
why it is that so many products
that are extensively advertised, all
at once drop out of sight and are
soon forgotten? The reason is
plain—the article did not fulfill
the promises of the manufacturer.
This applies more particularly to a
medicine, a medicinal preparation
that has real curative value almost
sells itself, as like an endless chain
system the remedy is recommended
by those who have been benefited,
to those who are in need of it.
A prominent druggist
for example, Dr. Kilmer’s Swamp-
Root, a preparation I have sold
for many years and never hesitate
to recommend, for in almost every
case it shows excellent results, as
many of my customers testify. No
other kidney remedy has so large a
sale.”
According to sworn statements
and verified testimony of thousands
who have used the preparation, the
success of Dr. Kilmer’s Swamp Root is due to the fact
that so many people claim that it
fulfills almost every wish in over
coming kidney, liver and bladder
ailments, corrects urinary troubles
and neutralizes the uric acid which
causes rheumatism.
You may receive a sample bottle
of Swamp-Root by Parcel Post. Ad
dress Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bingham

also mention this paper. Large
and medium size bottles for sale at

EYESIGHT
TWO little peepers are working for you whenever
your eyelids are open. They show you the way to
the things that you do. Forever they are searching
and groping.
Nature is wonderful. How do you know? Only be-
cause you have seen. Eyes let you have what the world
has to show, with vision that ought to be keen.
Look to your friends, as the old saying goes, and
look is what each person tries. But friends can’t be
seen, as a man surely knows, except through the help
of your eyes.
No matter what trouble may come in your way, you can
always find that there’s cheer in knowing it fades
out from day unto day. Your eyes let you see your way
clear.
And how are you treating these peepers, old man?
Consider it now. ere time flies. You’d best always give
them the best that you can. Take a tip, and take care
of your eyes.
