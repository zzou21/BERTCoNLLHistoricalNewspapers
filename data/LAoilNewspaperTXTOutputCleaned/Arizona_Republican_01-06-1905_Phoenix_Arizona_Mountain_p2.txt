PHOENIX, ARIZ., JANUARY 6, 1905.
Exit David B. Hill.
It is probable that, when David B.
Hill publicly announced last summer
that at the close of last year he would
permanently retire from active politics,
he meant his statement to be taken
in a "Pickwickian sense;" but on the
assumption that he was entirely sin
cere in his declaration, the democratic
party of the Empire state is likely now
to be a materially different organiza
tion from what it has been since twen
ty years ago, when Mr. Hill, then lieu
tenant governor, succeeded to the gov
ernorship of the state through the
election of Grover Cleveland to the
presidency.
Mr. Hill's public career is so well
known that it is not necessary at this
time to review it at length. He seems
to have modeled his political conduct
on that of Martin Van Buren, the "Sly
Fox of Kinderhook," as his political
enemies dubbed him, and he has de
pended chiefly on intrigue and chi
cane to achieve his ends. That he
possesses statesmanlike qualities of a
certain order will probably not be
denied, but those qualities have been
subordinated to an apparently inborn
instinct to "play politics," a fact
clearly shown in his career as gover
nor and as United States senator. Of
high political ideals he seems to be
completely destitute. He has been an
opportunist, pure and simple.
For this reason he never really en
joyed the confidence of the people of
this commonwealth or of the demo
crats of the country at large. In 1892
he aspired to be nominated for presi
dent on the democratic ticket; but, al
though he had his own state delegation
behind him, Grover Cleveland, then a
New Yorker also, ran away with the
prize. The national democratic par
ty plainly put no trust in him.
Mr. Hill's political career contains
a moral for all young men who are
ambitious for political distinction, and
it is one that they will not have to use
a magnifying glass in order to dis
cover. The German Jury System.
In this country a trial by jury comes
to a stop when one of the jurymen be
comes incapacitated for service by ill
ness or from any other cause. It is
then necessary to draw a new jury
and hold another trial, in order that
twelve men may hear the testimony
and render a verdict.
In Germany a system prevails which
does away with the possibility of such
delay and expense. In the current is
sue of the Political Science Quarterly
there is a paper by Burt Estes How
ard on "Trial by Jury in Germany,"
in which it is stated that in addition
to the regular jury of twelve men,
one or more supplementary jurymen
are drawn. They sit with the regular
jurors, having equal rights and duties
with them, except in the single matter
of retiring for deliberation and partici
pating in the finding of a verdict after
the counsel have summed up and the
judge has delivered his charge. But
if one of the original twelve becomes
incapacitated at any point during a
trial, a supplementary juryman takes
his place and becomes fully invested
with the functions of the one who has
retired, even to casting a vote when a
verdict is rendered. Thus the jury is
automatically kept up to the required
number and the trial proceeds without
interruption.
This arrangement seems so practical
and sensible that it is a wonder meas
ures have not been taken looking to
its adoption in this country. Do our
friends of the legal profession perceive
in it any objections which would off
set its manifest advantages?
Why We Have a Navy.
The Philadelphia Record conclusively
demonstrates the uselessness and
folly of our navy as follows: "The
warships are mainly intended to pro
tect our merchant marine, but we have
no merchant marine engaged in inter
national trading." So there we are with
a big navy and no mission for it. But
the American people will not generally
agree with the Record as to the rea-
son for the existence of a navy. The
merchant marine is only a fragment in
the scheme. If we hadn't a vessel on
the sea either in the coasting trade or
international service we would need
just as big a navy as we have today
or as we intend to have. The war
ships are intended to protect the na
tional flag wherever it floats, at home
or abroad. They are intended to vin
dicate and assert the nation's honor
wherever it shall be assailed. They are
intended to assert and defend the
rights of American citizens wherever
they may be assailed anywhere on the
globe; and they are intended to pro
tect our ports from invasion in the
event of war.

UNION LABEL

FUEL OIL FOR DAM
Bids Opened Yesterday at Office of
Reclamation Service.
Bids for fuel oil to be used at the
cement mill and for other purposes in
the construction of the Roosevelt dam,
were opened yesterday in the Phoenix
offices of the reclamation service.
There were present representing the
government, L. C. Hill, constructing
engineer, and W. H. Sanders and
George Y. Wisner, consulting engineers
who arrived yesterday morning from
Los Angeles.
The bids were asked for on seven
different propositions, none of the bid
ders presenting estimates on all of the
propositions but only on such as ap
pealed to them. Eleven bids entered
in the competition, the only one being
rejected for consideration being faulty in
that no certified check accompanied it
as provided for in the advertisement.
The bids primarily are for the fur
nishing of 50,000 barrels of oil, but the
question of transportation between the
supply point and the dam necessitated
the various propositions which were as
follows: Oil per barrel at supply
point; oil per barrel delivered at Mesa
City, the end of the Roosevelt wagon
road; oil delivered at Roosevelt; haul
ing oil per barrel, Mesa to Roosevelt;
hauling freight per ton, Mesa to
Roosevelt; hauling oil Globe to Roose
velt; hauling freight per ton, Globe to
Roosevelt.
In the awarding of contracts there
must be considered the cost of oil at
the various supply points; the railroad
freight to either Globe or Mesa, when
paid by the government; and the cost
of hauling from either Mesa or Globe,
to Roosevelt. Against these figures
whatever they may be, must be con
sidered the bids for oil delivered at
Roosevelt. The bids will be forwarded
to Washington where the contracts
will be awarded after due considera
tion. Mr. Hill and Mr. Sanders both
left for Washington last night, and
though they did not announce their
business they will naturally be on the
ground if their chief desires any fur
ther information concerning condi
tions. In respect of the wagon haul how
ever it is noted that the bid of Wolf
Sachs of Tempe for hauling oil from
Mesa to Roosevelt, $2.24 4/10 per barrel
is the lowest, the next in order being
that of John Tuttle who bid a quarter
of a cent per barrel higher. The bids
for oil at supply point run from nine
teen and nine-tenths cents per barrel
to twenty-seven and a half cents per
barrel. Taking Mr. Sachs' bid for
hauling and the lower bid at supply
point, would make the oil cost $2.44 15
per barrel plus the railroad freight
from Bakersfield as against $3.48, the
lowest bid for oil delivered at Roose
velt. Or taking the bid of $1.25 for
oil delivered at Mesa and adding to it
Mr. Sachs' freight haul of $2.24 4/10
makes a total cost at Roosevelt of
$3.40 2/5 as against the bid of $3.48 for
oil delivered at Roosevelt. An out
sider therefore must conclude that
much depends on what it will cost the
government to buy in the field and pay
the railroad freight itself.
Following are the bids submitted
for oil at supply point: Associated Oil
Co. of San Francisco, 25c per barrel
at Oil City, Cal.; Union Oil Co. of Los
Angeles, 19 9/10c per barrel at Bakers
field; William S. Miller of San Fran
cisco, 25c per barrel at Walt, Kern
County, Cal.; E. B. & A. L. Stone Co.
of Oakland, 27 1/2c per barrel at East
Consolidated Spur, Kern oil field.
There was one bid for oil delivered
at Mesa, that of $1.25 per barrel, by
the Associated Oil Co. of San Fran
cisco.
For oil delivered at Roosevelt the
same company bid $4.35 per barrel;
Edward Malley of San Francisco bid
$4.43; and C. R. Eager & Co. of Los
Angeles bid $3.48 per barrel.
The freighting bids are as follows:
Hauling oil Mesa to Roosevelt: Wolf
Sachs of Tempe, $2.24 4/10 per barrel;
John Tuttle, $2.24 5/10 per barrel; Ed
Cox of San Francisco, $2.26 per barrel
or $313.80 per ton; E. B. & A. L. Stone
& Co. of Oakland, $2.49 per barrel; O.
S. Stapley & Co. of Mesa, $2.59 per
barrel; Edward Malley of San Fran
cisco, $3.22 per barrel.
Hauling oil from Globe to Roosevelt:
Old Dominion Commercial Co. of Globe,
$2.43 per barrel.
Hauling freight from Globe to
Roosevelt: Old Dominion Commercial
Co., $13.00 per ton.
Hauling freight from Mesa: Wolf
Sachs, $13.60 per ton; C. R. Eager & Co.
of Los Angeles, $14.40 per ton; O.
S. Stapley & Co. of Mesa, $15.06 per
ton; John Tuttle, same figure, $15.00
per ton; Ed Cox, San Francisco, $17.00
per ton; E. B. & A. L. Stone Co. of
Oakland, $18.00 per ton; Edward Mal
ley of San Francisco, $18.50 per ton.

BAIL FOR NAN PATTERSON
That Question Will Probably Be De
cided Today.
New York, Jan. 5. When the argu
ment for the release of Nan Patter
son on bail was heard yesterday by
Justice Greenbaum, in the supreme
court, the justice reserved his decision
until today and requested the attor
neys to submit briefs. This morning
Justice Greenbaum informed Abraham
Levy, counsel for Miss Patterson, that
he had not received the briefs from the
district attorney's office and therefore
he could not render the decision until
later.
This afternoon the district attor
ney made his return to the petition for bail
but did not hand up his brief. Jus
tice Greenbaum then informed Mr.
Levy that he would take the matter
under advisement and that he would
not hand down his decision before to
morrow.

SANTA FE IN SOUTH-WEST
Raising More Capital for Improve
ments in This Region.
Topeka, Kan., Jan. 5. A call has
been issued for a meeting of the Santa
Fe board of directors on Jan. 24. A
vote will be taken on a proposition to
increase the capital stock of the com
pany by fifty million dollars and to
issue bonds for that amount. It is
stated that most of this money will be
used in building new roads and im
proving Santa Fe lines in the south
west. At this time the Santa Fe is engag
ed in the construction of a road bed
from Wickenburg, Arizona, to a point
west of the Colorado river, which will
probably be Ehrenburg. The Santa Fe
will exploit the advantages of the
southwest in every manner possible
and by building new roads make lands
valuable.
Melczer has just received a carload
of New York apple cider. Patrons
visiting the store should ask to see it.
