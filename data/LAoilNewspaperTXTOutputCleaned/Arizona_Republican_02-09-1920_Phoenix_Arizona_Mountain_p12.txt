That dollar in your
pocket is worth nothing

BUT IF invested in something which
through its usefulness, brings employment of a valuable service, the dollar becomes a power. That is why you can
profit by buying an Avery "Mr. Bill" planter, single or double row. Load both barrels
and "gun" for the biggest crops, while the "gunning" is good. Volume is what you
want this year in a cotton crop volume is
what you get when an Avery "Mr. Bill"
planter is used.

They do this because they have improvements found on no other make of planter,
such as a single seed drop, picker wheel,
insuring you a uniform feed a good stand
the planter that is used more than any
other make in the southwest.
Get yours now, while you can.
