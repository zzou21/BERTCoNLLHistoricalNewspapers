While attempting to ride a freight
train at Gila Bend Sunday, James
McCall, the son of Mrs. R. F. Doll,
had his foot so badly mangled that
it had to be amputated.
Although there have been many
stories of the accident, the following
is said to be the most authentic.
James and Louis Killeen Jr., his
chum, were "roughing" their way to
California and had got as far as
Gila Bend when the sad mishap oc
curred. James is said to have been
riding on top of a freight car and,
seeing a brakeman coming, slid down
between two cars when his foot slipped
and he fell outward. The speed
of the train was not sufficient to
throw him clear of the track and his
right foot was caught and crushed by
the heavy wheels. Dr. K. V. Rich
ards of Gila Bend dressed the wound
and sent the boys back to Phoenix
where further treatment could be ob
tained. McCall was met at the station by
an ambulance and was taken to the
Sisters of Mercy hospital, where it
was found necessary to amputate the
mangled foot. It was believed at
first that an operation was not nec
essary but the foot was so badly
crushed that it was imperative. -
Fate often deals cruel blows to
young men and James realizes it, but
he is bearing his misfortune like a
man and intends to make the best
of it.
His nurse states that he is doing
nicely and is certain that his con
valescence will be quite rapid.
A few of James' many friends
called to see him yesterday and he
had a cheery "hello" for everyone.
It is hard to realize how one
would feel and act under similar
circumstances, but it is certain that
it would require much "backbone" to
be pleasant and cheery.
McCall's many friends wish him a
speedy recovery and hope that he will
be among them again very soon.

Mrs. Moore, at the General
Federation, of Women's
Clubs, Knew How to Run
It and She Ran It to Suit
Herself.

The suffragettes of this glorious
commonwealth, who have been look
ing forward to an endorsement of
feminine participation in governmental
affairs by the general Federation
of Women's Clubs at San Francisco,
have been grievously, not to say tear
fully disappointed. For the federa
tion did nothing of the kind. In
fact, it did just the other thing. It
refused, or rather, its president, Mrs.
Philip North Moore, refused to let
the question of woman suffrage go
before the convention at all. It was
sad, not to say gloomy.
And, say, everybody should take
notice that there is some considerable
political clout to Mrs. Moore, who has
just ended her term as president of

women's federation. Talk about

Hamburg-American Line Gets Out
Elaborate Information Folder For
World Tourists.

The neatest steamship folder has
been received at the city office of the
Southern Pacific.
It comes from the Hamburg-American
line of ocean steamers; and in it
particular attention is paid in the de
scriptive part to the "Around the World
Cruises" for which the German-American
line has become famous. Accord
ing to data in the booklet, a tourist can
leave New York with any of a dozen
boats, and make the circle of the globe
personally conducted to all the best
sightseeing places by competent guides
and attendants furnished by the com
pany. Attractive illustrations are features
of the folder. The cuts are of the bet
ter sort, giving a real life look to the
views. The pictures set off the beaut
ies and marvels of such interesting
lands as Japan, India and Mediterranean
countries. - .,.
The author has gathered full infor
mation about each place mentioned,
and not the least convenient feature
is the list of guide books and works by
travelers, which supply absorbing read
ing matter to go with the actual visits.

steam rollers and things of that kind!
Not even the late lamented Theodore
Roosevelt knows better how to manip
ulate that engine of political destruc
tion than does Mrs. Moore. And Mrs.
Moore not only knew all the levers
and other thingumjigs of the steam
roller aforesaid, But she showed a
most jovial willingness to put them
in operation. And she did put them
in operation. She operated so suc
cessfully that she completely squelched
(it isn't a polite word, but is the
only one that fits) the suffragettes,
who asked the convention to endorse
their cause.
"Not in order," said Mrs. Moore
crisply.
"Why?" asked a Los Angeles suf
fragette. (Of course she used a lot
more words than that, but the mono
syllable expresses it all.)
"Not germane," said the president.
"We're not deciding the suffrage
question here. We have other work
to do." And she brought her cute
little gavel down with a resounding
whack or was it a thud?
Anyhow, it did the work. There
were a few abortive attempts to find
out the whys and the wherefores, but
the steam roller moved on relentless
ly and the suffrage proposition was
crushed and in the home of its
friends at that.

That is why
grief in Arizona.

advocates.

"Not that it makes any real differ
ence," said one of them. "We believe
the convention should have endorsed
the movement and we should have
liked it to take that action for the
sake of the moral effect: but it
didn't, and that's all there is to it
that is, all except one thing. We're
going to win, anyway."
However, it may be said that the
policy of the general convention at
San Francisco is on the same line as
the policy pursued by the Arizona
federation. It is true, many of the
members of that organization are suf
fragists it is probable that even a
majority of them are, but at that the
federation has never taken up the
fight. It has steered clear of political
questions generally, leaving those
matters to the individual taste of the
members.

"The skin affection began in a little red
colored rash on my right leg, and gradually

spread to other parts of my
body. . Then small pimples
appeared and later several
boils on my leg. The skin
around the boils was' at
first bright red, and after
wards became darker col
ored. The clothing irritated
the boils. The pain caused
nervousness and loss of
sleep, and the itching was

intense. After using various remedies for
about six months I saw how a person af
flicted with skin disease was cured by using
Cuticura Soap and Ointment.
"I bathed the sores with Cuticura Soap
and hot water and then applied Cuticura
Ointment and after about six months' con
stant treatment the sores gradually healed
leaving the skin soft and smooth. Cuticura
Soap and Ointment effected a complete
cure." (Signed) H. A. Robinson. Feb. 24, '12.

dim labor now the great distress of
the homeless, who sleep in the mun
icipal lodging houses, whose life of
hope and striving is all in the past.
New York City pays every year for
the vacation of from four to five
thousand men and women. These
vacations may be of one week or
many. If the person is committed to
the workhouse by a magistrate for

vagrancy, that is another matter.
The thing is done. But if of one's
own volition, one requests from the
outdoor poor department a trip to the
island he is free to return whenever
he pleases, such a person is a "va
cationer." Matron Mary Hartigan has at
present more than three thousand
women to care for.
Vacationers take with them a little
pile of hard earned or begged, pennies
with which to buy their tobacco and
various things, and therefore, there
is a small store on the island.
"I'll treat today," said one of the
two aged vacationers who had come
to the store soon after arriving at
the island. "I'll get that tea we both
like."
"Yes, but we have no teapot," said
the other, "I'll get that, and two
cups."
A quarter of a pound of tea, two
cups and a teapot were purchased.
"I suppose you wonder what on
earth they are going to do with those
don't you?" said the matron.
"Well, come on and I'll show you.
See, they have met two old men
whom they have known some place
or other. Now watch."
All four hobble off together toward
a little frame house, where the old
women disappeared and the old men
disposed themselves under a tree, and
smoked and talked. Soon the women
came out of the house, one with the
cups and one with the teapot. All
then sat down in a circle and began
drinking their afternoon tea, if you
please, and enjoying their first day

FLIES ATTACK WILD ANIMALS,

Driven from the Forest, Moose Seek
Shelter in Suburbs of Duluth

Flies are so numerous, so large and
so vicious in the northern woods that
the wild animals are being driven
from their haunts and are seeking
the lake shore and the streams.
A full grown bull moose wandered
into Woodland, a fashionable resi
dence district suburb of Duluth, Min
nesota. Early in the week a moose
was killed by a freight train at Short
Line Park, only eight miles from the
city hall.
Old-time hunters say the flies are
probably responsible. They say that
the insects have never been so thick
in the woods, owing to the wet spring.
