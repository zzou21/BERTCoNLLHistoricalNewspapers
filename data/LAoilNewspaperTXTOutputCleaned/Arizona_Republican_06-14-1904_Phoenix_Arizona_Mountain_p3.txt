THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, TUESDAY MORNING, JUNE 14, 1904

C. Do you ever think your boy
plays too hard?
C. I tell you a boy that knows how
to play has good stuff in him. He'll
work all the better for it by
and by.
But remember, he's burning up
a lot of energy.
C. Give him plenty of "FORCE."

A boy can easily grow thin and starved and anæmic, even if he
does stuff his stomach three times a day unless the food is the
right sort.
It isn't what you get that counts it's only what digests the
part that is absorbed and builds up muscles and nerves and brain.
"FORCE" is the ideal food for growing children, because it not
only digests itself but helps to digest the other food substances
that are eaten with it.

W. U. A. CONDEMNATION SUIT

Permission Given to Run Power Canal
Across Lee Holdings.

Judge Kibbey, attorney, and F. H.
Parker, secretary, of the Salt River
Valley Water Users Association, re
turned Sunday morning from Globe
where they went to be present at the
hearing of the condemnation suit
brought by the Association against the
Lee family, for right of way for the
power canal across the lands of the de
fendant. By an agreement between the parties
to the suit the Water Users Association
was given possession, on giving bond
in the sum of $2,000, and the case was
continued till the canal shall have been
completed, when the proper compensa
tion for the parties injured can be bet
ter determined. George W. P. Hunt
and T. A. Pascoe of Globe went on the
bond of the Water Users Association
for the amount named.

Judge Kibbey expects to leave to
night for Los Angeles to confer with
representatives of the Water Users As
sociation formed in the Imperial coun
try. As will be remembered he recent
ly visited that section with Mr. New
ell's party and with the other members
of the party addressed a public meet
ing. He has received a telegram ask
ing him to attend this conference, from
which it is assumed the Imperial people
desire to retain him to help them in
working out the irrigation problem.

The questions that confront the Im
perial people are even more confusing
than those which have been settled in
this valley and at Yuma. At least they
are different in many respects and will
require some patient study. Should
the water users succeed in bringing
themselves under the operation of the
reclamation act there may be complica
tions with the Mexican government if
the present canal system is utilized,
for part of it lies in Mexico. If a new
canal is dug a part of the way, com
plications may arise with the canal
company which has promised water to
certain Americans who have taken up
lands in Mexico.

Parties desiring hotel or apartment
house accommodations in Los Angeles,
or at any of the beach resorts during
the summer, will find it to their inter
est before coming, to communicate with
Green & Underwood, agents, 316
Bradbury building, Los Angeles, Cal.

BUSINESS AND POLITICS
Conditions and Opinions Prevailing
in the East.

General R. Allyn Lewis arrived in the
city yesterday. Excepting a brief stop
at Tucson, he came directly from New
York. He will leave tonight for the
southern part of the territory and may
visit Cananea before his return. He
will remain in the territory about two
weeks.

Business is dull in the east, General
Lewis said, without a prospect of an
early improvement, a condition which
may be expected in presidential years.

He was asked regarding the political
situation. He said he had paid very lit
tle attention to politics but he thought
there was no doubt of the election of
Roosevelt. Concerning the democratic
presidential nomination, General Lew
is said that there is a growing opinion
that the nominee may not be Judge
Parker. On the contrary, Judge Gray
is looked upon as the most promising
dark horse. The antagonism of leader
Murphy and Tammany to Judge Parker
has not abated, as it was thought it
would after the New York convention.
There is not a strong personal objection
to Parker, but there is a very strong
personal and political objection to Hill.
The democrats believe that Gray would
be as strong in the east as Parker and
even stronger in New York, for the op
position of Tammany to Hill is so
strong that it would likely be carried to
the polls. It is more important to
Tammany that the Hill faction shall
be put down than that a democratic
president should be elected.

It is believed, though, that all shades
of democrats might be united on Gray.
He was an ardent supporter of Cleve
land during his administration and he
was an equally ardent supporter of
Bryan in his two campaigns, though he
may not have endorsed all his notions.
As chairman of the anthracite strike
commission he is supposed to command
the respect of both employer and em
ploye.

Iron Springs can now boast of a first
class grocery store, Mr. Patton having
shipped in a straight car of high grade
groceries he can sell for less than they
can be laid down by local freight.

YOUNG SWEETHEART OF MINE

I long with deepest longing,
For some sesame to art,
I would sketch a life-like picture
Of a being near my heart.
I would paint her true to nature
With no added tint or line,
For no artist’s dream is fairer than
This “young sweetheart of mine.”

She is a winsome creature,
Busy, busy every day,
And her life is gladsome music
Such as song birds make in May.
I forget all cares and heartaches
And the world seems gay and fine
When I listen to the prattle of
This young sweetheart of mine.

Her eyes I try to fathom,
And the hue of heaven behold,
As I muse upon her life so fair
And form of perfect mold.
Faith and hope are present graces,
Love is as a dawning sign.
It shall beam thro’ fadeless ages on
This “young sweetheart of mine.”

Yet there is an undercurrent,
’Neath that superficial show,
When the tide of love sits stoutly
Thro’ its rhythmic ebb and flow.
A day in fitful April,
Alternating storm or shine,
Is a figure well descriptive of
This “young sweetheart of mine.”

CONCERNING THE
COST OF A
STEINWAY PIANO

If any dealer tells you that there is another make of pianos costing as
much at the factory as the Steinway he is not only guilty of a gross
misrepresentation, but is saying that which he knows isn’t true and is
trying to impose upon your credulity.
STEINWAY PIANOS
Positively cost a third to a half more at the factory than any of the
half dozen other makes of high-grade pianos claiming to be in the
Steinway class; and the difference in price is not for name and repu
tation—as many dealers would have you believe—but for actual time,
labor and material.
