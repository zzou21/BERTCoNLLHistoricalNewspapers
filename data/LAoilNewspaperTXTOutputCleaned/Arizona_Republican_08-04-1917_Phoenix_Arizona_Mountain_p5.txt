effect that he had.  

THE REPUBLICAN
CONGRATULATED
FOR ENTERPRISE  

PHOENIX, August 3, 1917.  
Arizona Republican:  
Gentlemen: I cannot help offering a
word of congratulation to The Arizona
Republican for being so enterprising
as to secure for its readers the "Gerard
in Germany" story.  
I am sure that all red-blooded patri
ots are looking forward to this article
with keen interest and the fact that the
Arizona Republican can offer the story
to its readers one day earlier than the
Los Angeles papers is a bit of service
to readers that appeals to me.  
This not only speaks very highly for
The Republican, but it shows very
plainly that Arizona has a newspaper
equally as enterprising as any of the
papers of the larger cities.  

Yours very truly,  
HYDER BROS.,  
By John Hyder.  

A complaint was filed in the state
corporation commission office yes
terday by the Arizona Hercules Min
ing company against the Ray and
Gila Valley railway company alleging
unjust and discriminatory rates and
asking reparation in the sum of
$6,000 for the collection by the de
fendant from the complainant of
such rates within the last two years.
The line of the defendant runs be
tween the property of the complainant
and Ray Junction on the Arizona
Eastern.
There was filed with the complaint
an exhibit describing all the ship
ments of the complainant with the
rates collected, over the line of the
defendant within the period men
tioned in the complaint.  

BRANCH LIBRARY ADDITIONS
ARE NUMEROUS  

One hundred and fifty volumes were
added to the branch library at the
Municipal Rest Room during the
month of July making the total num
ber of volumes of the branch 650.
This item was contained in the re
port of the matron, Mrs. E. H. Ab
bot, to City Manager Robert A. Craig.
Mrs. Abbot stated in her report that
1,500 had registered at the rest room
during the past 30 days and that the
women’s exchange department had a
most successful month.  

WASHOUTS DELAY
RAILWAY TRAFFIC  

Washouts on both the Arizona
Eastern and the Southern Pacific
railroads were reported in railroad
circles yesterday morning.  
Owing to a washout in the vicinity
of Price this morning, it was neces
sary for the transfer of passengers
and mail on an extra train sent down
from the Ray district. Trains will
be operated in both directions to the
point of the washout until it is re
paired.  
The eastbound train from California
on the Southern Pacific was a num
ber of hours late as a result of a
washout east of Maricopa. As a re
sult of the delay it did not arrive in
Phoenix until 3:30 o'clock in the af
ternoon.  

International Sunday  
School Lesson for  
August 5  

MANASSEH'S SIN AND REPENT
ANCE  

Golden Text — "Let the wicked for
sake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts; and let him return unto
the LORD, and he will have mercy up
on him; and to our God, for he will
abundantly pardon." Isa. 55:7.  

Lesson Text. 2 Chron. 33:9-16.  
(Read 1-20. Memorize vs. 12, 13.)  

(9) So (And) Manasseh made Judah
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,
and to do worse, so that they did evil
more than the heathen (nations)
whom the LORD had destroyed before
the children of Israel. (10) And the
LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his
people; but they would not hearken
(gave no heed). (11) Wherefore the
LORD brought upon them the captains
of the host of the king of Assyria,
which took Manasseh among the
thorns (in chains), and bound him with
fetters, and carried him to Babylon.  
(12) And when he was in affliction
(distress) he besought the LORD his
God, and humbled himself greatly be
fore the God of his fathers. (13)And
he prayed unto him; and he was
intreated of him, and heard his sup
plication, and brought him again to
Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
Manasseh knew that the LORD he was
God. (14) Now after this he built a
(an outer) wall without (to) the city of
David, on the west side of Gihon, in
the valley, even at the entering in at
the Fish Gate, and compassed
Ophel, and raised it up a very great
height, and put captains of war in all
the fenced cities of Judah. (15) And he
took away the strange gods, and the
idol out of the house of the LORD, and
all the altars that he had built in the
mount of the house of the LORD, and
in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the
city. (16) And he repaired (built up)
the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed
(offered) thereon peace offerings and
thank offerings (sacrifices of peace of
ferings and of thanksgiving), and com
manded Judah to serve the LORD,
(the) God of Israel.
