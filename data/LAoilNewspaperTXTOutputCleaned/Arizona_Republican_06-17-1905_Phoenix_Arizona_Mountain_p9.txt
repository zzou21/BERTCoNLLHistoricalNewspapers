If practice will win the contest between
the fire companies in Prescott on the Fourth
of July the Tempe department will stand
a good show for a liberal amount of the
prize money. Since it has been definitely
decided that a team from here will enter the
contest, there has been some good prac
ticing some evenings. It is also proposed
to have a practice every evening between
now and then excepting Sundays. The first
practice run was made Thursday evening
and at that time a hundred yard dash was
made and water turned on in about
28 seconds. Not so bad for the first
run. The members of the team are
showing a great deal of enthusiastic
interest in the matter and turn out
each evening and all in all Chief Finch
feels confident that Tempe will take
a share of the prize money on the fourth.

A SURPRISE PARTY.
A surprise party was given Frank
Hanna by a number of his friends at
his home Thursday evening. There
were some twenty-five present and the
evening was pleasantly spent in games
and music. Light refreshments were
served. Those present were: Mr. and
Mrs. Hanna, Misses Fannie Armitage,
Pearl, Carrie and Ruby Haigler, Reah
Conser, Mary and Thomasine Morrow,
Bessie Brown, Mable Meyer,
Catharyn Parry, Jessie Mather, Alber
ta and Juanita Painter; Messrs. John
nie and Jay Ellingsen, Otto Conser,
Parley Blake, Howard and Frank
Hanna.

AMUSEMENTS
The second performance of "A Waif
of the Sea" was well given at the
theatre last evening. The acting was
above the average; the leads were
sympathetically interpreted and the
audience showed much enthusiasm.
Miss Tucker as the heroine gave a
most effective impersonation which
was the feature of the evening. Mr.
Brandon also did excellent work in
his part. The company is doing strong
work and the theatre attendance is
liberal.

NEW BUILDING.
The L. W. Blinn Lumber company
has just completed one of the finest
lumber yard buildings in the valley at
Mesa. The building is about 100 feet
wide and on the south side is roofed
for 105 feet, while on the north side
is roofed over for about 100 feet, leav
ing a space in the rear for material
that does not have to be put under
shelter. The building is roofed from
either side for 30 feet and then the
intermediate space covered by a higher
roof connecting both roofs. The front
of the building is finished in rustic
with a large gate on either side.
The offices of the company are to be
located on the center front, and when
all is completed inside it will be one
of the most complete lumber plants in
the valley. A neat fence encloses the
lot belonging to the company.

LILIES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY.
In a recent interview with Mrs. Lilly
Lundy she very modestly said:
"The fact that I believe in the im
portance of mind over matter helps
me to the truth that the foundation of
all health is good physical condition.
You can not keep your physical beauty
without health. A sick woman cannot
be pretty. To eat regularly, with per
fect digestion, is one of the first timid
things - work, sunshine, exercise, prop
er food, pure water and rest. I daily
take my favorite tonic for vitality,
which is Herbine. It builds up the
system, strengthens the nerves, helps
digestion and stimulates the liver.
It is especially fine for that tired feel
ing and the run-down condition. Try
it. It helps many and is very easily
taken. Price 50 cents per bottle.
Sold by all druggists."

LEAVES FOR LOS ANGELES.
Tracy Smith, head man for the Eager
Co., of Los Angeles, who has the oil
contract for the dam, left for Los
Angeles last night. The traction engine
he says is a success and started on an
other trip to Government wells yester
day. He will be gone for some time.
