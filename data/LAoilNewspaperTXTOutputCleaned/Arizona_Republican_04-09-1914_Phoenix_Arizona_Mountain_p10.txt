TRAGEDY
The first tragedy in many months
to mar the peace of Tempe occurred
yesterday morning shortly after five
o'clock near the Arizona and Eastern
stock yards when Dr. A. L. Wiggins
fired five shots into the body of Tap
Booth causing death instantly. The
killing took place at the second camp
of the Southwestern Sugar Company's
local force, this portion of the crew
making their quarters just about
three hundred yards southeast of the
stock yards.
GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOARD MEET

Tempe grammar school met on Tues

into consideration but not to such
an extent to make public. The board
adjourned until Monday evening,
April 13, 1914, at which time they
will take up the work where discon
tinued and elect in full the faculty

a number of other important matters
to occupy their attention at that time
all of which will be announced later.

ULSTER FIGHT
WILL
BE FOUGHT IN PARLIAMENT
Bill Amending and Killing
Home Rule Measure
Loses By Dwindling Ma
jority; Big Guns Trained
On Hot Debate
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
LONDON, April 8. By a majority
of eighty, an amendment for the re
jection of the home rule bill was de
feated in the House of Commons.
Without division the bill was given
for a third time its second reading in
the House. Announcement of the
result evoked louder cheering from
the opposition than for the ministeri
alists, the opposition interpreting it as
gratifying proof of a dwindling gov
ernment majority.
But the diminution was accounted
for to some extent by abstention from
the voting of the O'Brienites. The
speeches were generally more conci
liatory in tone than those which mark
ed the bill's earlier passages.
John E. Redmond, the nationalist
leader, who opened the debate, again
held out the olive branch to Ulster in
a speech frank in its eloquence. He
urged him and his colleagues to agree on
the permanent exclusion of deter-
mined areas and to abandon in princi
ple "Ireland as a nation."
Andrew Bonar Law, the opposition
leader, although professing in certain
passages of his speech to see hardly
a hope of a peaceful settlement, said
that nothing would come of it.
Law, said that the government was
pushing the bill through under a sys
tem which was virtually one-chamber
government. He recalled the phrase
of Sir Edward Grey that "single cham
ber government meant domination and
disaster" and said that the prophecy
was being fulfilled. He also urged
that the government continue.
Law said, the unionists are ready to
make every reasonable sacrifice to
avoid the calamity of civil strife.
There are only two ways whereby
that can be averted; one is the ex
clusion of Ulster from the bill, the
other is the proposal made for the re
newal of the conversation between the
leaders of the two parties as Sir Ed
ward has suggested.
In the opinion of the speaker the
situation was never more replete
with danger than at the present time.
If the government chooses, it has
the power to ruin Ulster but it
would never succeed in compelling
the Ulster forces, against their will,
to go outside the protection of the
British parliament.
Augustine Birrell, chief secretary
for Ireland, closed the debate. He ar
gued that civil war was impossible.
He was amazed at the patience dis
played by the Catholics and nation
alists in Ulster under great provoca
tions. It showed, he said, that there
was no need of civil war to effect a
settlement of the question. Ulster
must be won; her opposition overcome;
but it could not be done by force,
hence the government's proposals.
The second reading of the home
rule bill carried the first time by a
majority of 101, the second time by
a majority of 88. Tonight eight O'Bri
enites abstained from voting, and two
liberals voted against the government.
One nationalist was absent through
illness. Three laborites were also ab
sent, and Charles F. G. Mastman, who
had previously voted as a member of
the government, lost his seat in the
election for Bethnal Green last Feb
ruary.
HOT LEAD
SOUTH SIDE WELL TO BE
DRILLED DEEP
Dr. E. W. Wilbur Behind Proposi
tion to Reclaim Extensive Tract
North-east of Mesa; Will Im
prove Citrus Planting
A contract was awarded yesterday to
E. P. Fuller, representing a Kansas
City pump house, by Dr. E. W. Wilbur
for a well five hundred feet in depth
and 18 inches in diameter to be
bored on the north Y4 of Section 1,
Township 1 north and Range 6 east.
Mr. Fuller has been engaged in sink
ing wells practically all over the state
and is not in the least afraid of the
formation which underlies the tract
taken by Dr. Wilbur and a number of
the local residents two years ago with
the intention of setting out extensive
orange groves. A few of the individ
uals who took up desert land at that
time have used spring title to their
lands which the county has no inimical
significance. He is merely taking a
holiday arranged for some time ago.

DESERT ILL
Dr. E. W. Wilson Behind
Proposition to Reclaim
Extensive Tract North-
East of Mesa Will Im
prove Citrus Trees
A contract was awarded yesterday to
E. P. Fuller, representing a Kansas
City pump house, by Dr. E. W. Wilbur
to sink a well five hundred feet in
depth and 18 inches in diameter. The
doctor has decided to secure water for
his land and set the tract to citrus
and deciduous fruits.
This will be the first deep well in
the immediate vicinity. There are a
number of deep wells on the south side,
the deepest of which is the McQueen
well something like 1300 feet, but the
Wilbur well is to be the deepest in the
section northwest of Mesa. According
to the doctor the possible plant for the
well will depend entirely upon the
amount of water secured. He is desirous
of pumping as much water as possible.
It is practically assured that in the
event that a success is made of the
venture that the entire section which
was entered two years ago, will be im
proved.

ments in bridge building proposed for
a long time is that of the construction
of reinforced cement structures across
the Tempe canal on the Mesa-Tempe
highway and across the Consolidated

Roosevelt road. The structures in use
at the present time are landmarks of
a acre of years ago and are in bad
repair. The new structures it is under
stood are to be parallel with the
road, and not to cross the canal at
the shortest distance.

PURCHASES AUTOMATIC FEEDER
The local cotton exchange has de
cided to purchase automatic feeders
for their gins at this place. They have

last campaign and they are firmly con
vinced that it is a paying proposition.

certain that better prices will be real
ized for the product in the bale, it is
claimed that the cotton will be in bet
ter condition.
HERE FROM IMPERIAL

stationed at Imperial Valley connected
with the department of agriculture, ar
rived in the city from Washington yes
terday evening for the purpose of in
vestigating the local cotton conditions.
Mr. MacLachlan is vitally interested in
