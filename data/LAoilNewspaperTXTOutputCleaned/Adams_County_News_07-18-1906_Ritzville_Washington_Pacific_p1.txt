and trust in God and the future of
Russia, he instructed them not to hold
aloof from the soldiers in the ranks,

and "look after their needs and inter
ests, in order to bring them closer to their
officers."

NEGROES TOLD TO GO

placed on the same train with the
body of a negro who last week shot

negro tenderloin, known as the "Hole
In the Wall," was invaded by several

"House after house was visited and
the inmates not even being given time
to dress, were taken out and turned
over to a guard. The motley group
was marched under guard of pistols to
a water tank about a mile from town,
a passenger train was stopped and
the negroes put aboard and their fare
paid as far as the parish line, mem
bers of the guard riding that far with
them. Some of the negro women were
shipped away in their night dresses."

KILLED HER BROTHER.

Either Mitchell Shot Him in Depot at
Seattle.
Esther Mitchell shot and instantly
killed her brother, George Mitchell, at
Seattle last Thursday afternoon in the
waiting room of the Union depot. The
shot was fired just as Mitchell rose to
take the evening train for Oregon. The
brother, who was acquitted only the
Tuesday before of slaying Franz Ed
mund Creffield, the leader of the "holy
rollers," dropped in his tracks.
Esther Mitchell was at once arrested.
The Mitchells, George, Perry and
Fred, were sitting with Esther on a
bench in the big waiting room, talking
together and apparently on the best of
terms. When the Oregon train was
announced, George Mitchell rose and
started forward. His sister stepped to
his side and, pressing the revolver close
to his head, pulled the trigger before
anyone had realized what was happen
ing.
Esther Mitchell is the sister to avenge
whose alleged ill treatment George shot
Creffield. She has refused to have any
thing to do with her brother since the
shooting. Thursday was the first time
they have been seen together on good
terms.
Esther Mitchell made the following
statement:
"Mrs. Creffield and I talked over the
matter of killing George. The one that
had the best chance was to do it. Mrs.
Creffield bought the gun.
We were at the room about 4 o'clock
during the afternoon and I thought
that I would have a better chance to do
it than Mrs. Creffield gave me the gun
and I was to do it. We agreed that it
was to be done as soon as possible.
Mrs. Creffield had been out once or
twice looking for George and if she had
got the chance she would have done it
and I would have done the same. The
first that got a chance was to do it. I
would have done it before if I had got
a chance."
Esther Mitchell is the 18-year-old
girl for whom her brother George shed
the blood of Franz Edmund Creffield,
when he shot down the leader of the
so-called "holy rollers" in Seattle, May
7. It was because of her alleged ruin
by the fanatical leader that Mitchell
took a life and risked his own, and the
cold-blooded murder of George Mitchell
is his reward.

"THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME."

Douglas Company to Present Military
Drama This Week.
Belasco & Fyles' military drama,
"The Girl I Left Behind Me," is the
offering of the Byron Douglas com

party is sent out to watch the Reds.
In the party are Lieutenants Parlow
and Hawkesworth. The former is the
affianced husband of Kate Kennlon,
daughter of the commander. He proves
a coward on the expedition, but on
the return of the command to the fort
he shifts the blame to the shoulders of
Lieutenant Hawkesworth, who, to
prove his bravery, is sent on a danger
ous expedition to bring relief to the
fort.
During a post ball on the following
night the Indians surround the fort,
and are to attack at daybreak. The
garrison is outnumbered and General
Kennlon is about to shoot his daughter
to prevent her capture by the savages
when a bugle call is heard and rein
forcements come to the aid of the be
sieged garrison. Byron Douglas will
have the role of Lieutenant Hawkes
worth. Miss Henriette Browne will ap
pear as Kate Kennlon. The part of
Lieutenant Parlow will be taken by
Thomas Clark, a new addition to the
company, and W. J. Montgomery will
appear as Scar Brow, an educated In
dian. Popular prices prevail.
