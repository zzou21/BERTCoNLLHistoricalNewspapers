U.P. Morning Journal Special Wire!
St. Michaels, Md., June
23, 1909.
Huberts, charged with murdering Mrs.
Edith May Woodill of Los Angeles,
was surrounded in the house of John
L. McIlwain, at Coyman, seven miles
from here, tonight. A posse left in
automobiles to aid in his capture. Huberts is said to be heavily armed.
Huberts called at McIlwain's house
for water. McIlwain invited him in and
then sent his wife secretly to notify
neighbors, by whom the house was
surrounded.
Practically the entire eastern shore
of Maryland joined in the hunt. The
police say they have evidence con-
necting Huberts with the murder.
Mrs. Woodill's nude body, the skull
crushed in, and the face disfigured,
was discovered yesterday by boys who
were crabbing in Hack creek, not far
from the home of Mrs. Woodill's foster
father, Capt. Charles P. Thompson, a few miles from here.
Huberts was with Mrs. Woodill
when she was seen last. He claimed
to be a magazine writer and general
correspondent of newspapers. He is
even said to have returned to this
locality after a short absence for the
express purpose of writing up the
murder which he is now accused of
having committed. Mr. and Mrs.
Woodill came here a short time ago,
the latter with the intention of passing
the summer with her foster father. Her husband remained only a
few days, leaving, it is understood,
for Detroit, whence he intended to
return to Los Angeles. From that
time Mrs. Woodill and Huberts are
said to have seen much of each other.
Last Saturday Mrs. Woodill went to
Easton to have some dental work
done, and it had been arranged that
Huberts should meet her at Royal Oak and go home with her. Huberts
drove to Royal Oak, met Mrs. Wood-
ill and drove with her back here to
the landing, where his launch was
moored. They entered the launch
and Mrs. Woodill was not seen again
alive, so far as has been learned.
Since her disappearance Huberts
went to Baltimore, from which point
a letter was received by Captain
Thompson, ostensibly from Mrs.
Woodill, saying she was in that city
and would shortly return. Huberts
remained in this neighborhood until
after the finding of the body. He
had previously endeavored to allay
the growing uneasiness of Captain
Thompson in connection with his foster daughter's absence, and used the
letter as evidence in support of his
contention that she soon would re-
turn. When the body was brought
ashore, it was so swollen that Captain
Thompson could not, at first, believe
that it was the body of Mrs. Wood-
ill. Last night Justice Willev tele-
phoned to the boarding house of
George Taylor, made inquiries about
Huberts and mentioned that he was
suspected of the murder. Huberts
was beside Taylor during this con-
versation and upon learning of the
suspicion against him, remarked: "If
that is the case, I will not go to
Baltimore." A few minutes later he
was found to have disappeared and it
was afterwards discovered that he
had taken Taylor's skiff.
Investigation indicates that when
Huberts and Mrs. Woodill left here
they went in the launch to a bungalow that is being built on Huberts'
farm, near that of Captain
Thompson, and that on this bungalow the
murder was committed. There
were found a bloody sheet and mattress and portions of the woman's
clothes, partly burned. These have
been identified as belonging to Mrs.
Woodill. There were also found in
the bungalow a pair of yellow
trousers, in the pocket of which were
two letters. One believed to have
been from Mrs. Woodill and to have
some connection with the meeting at
Royal Oak, was dated June 16 and
read:
"Dear Bobby: Can't come down
Haven't even had my morning abula-
tion and I know how men hate wait-
ing. Why, I would be afraid you
would wear out the parlor rug pin-
vour temper if you tried it. It is
only an intermittent delirium and now
you had better go and 'wash your
dishes.' Even without any imagina-
tion you must know I will be thinking
of you."
This was signed "Doll Huby."
The other letter, also dated June
16th, from Easton, read:
"Roberts: Bryan and Short will ar-
rive Oxford boat 12 o'clock tonight.
Captain Dale will take us over to your
joint, let there about 12:30 o'clock.
But must leave after looking the
place over. Sorry you have decided
not to go this time. Girls all at
Annapolis. Here is the money you
sent for me. Yours,
"HOWARD."
The room in which these things
were found showed evidences of a
struggle. The bungalow was searched last night. It was discovered to-
day that crabbers in the river early
Tuesday morning were passed by a
vessel from which they saw an ap-
parently heavy object thrown into the
water. The police announce the sus-
picion that the vessel was Huberts'
launch and that it was Mrs. Woodill's
body that was cast into the water.
An iron pot used to weight the body
has been identified as having been at
a house on the present site of Hub-
erts' bungalow.
Mrs. Woodill is said to have married a physician of New York, pre-
vious to her marriage with Woodill.
There is a mystery about her parent-
age.
Captain Thompson says she was
given to him when she was but two years old
from the family of a poor street car
man in Minneapolis.
Mrs. Woodill before her marriage
was given an excellent musical edu-
cation in this country and Europe and
she is said to have sung in the Whit
House before President McKinley.
She was a beautiful woman and was
given a warm welcome by her many
friends in this locality.
Former Secretary of the Treasury
Lyman J. Gage took much interest
in Mrs. Woodill prior to her murder and
has visited his young protege in
Captain Thompson's home.
Victim of
Wife Known in
Los Angeles, June
News of the murder of
Mrs. Edith May
Woodill, the young
Woodill, president of the Woodill Automobile company
caused a sensation here, where not
many were well acquainted with Mr. Woodill, who
returned from Maryland about a week
ago, where he had been on a visit
with his wife, is prostrated by the
blow. Neither he nor any of their
relatives or friends know of any af-
fair in which Mrs. Woodill was in-
volved that might have lead to such
a tragedy.
Mr. Woodill received a letter from
his wife today filled with expressions
of affection and of hope for their
early reunion. A few minutes after
reading the letter Mr. Woodill re-
ceived the telegram announcing the
bare fact that his wife had been mur-
dered in Maryland.
Mrs. Woodill was twenty
years of
age and was formerly Miss Edith May
Thompson, a ward of Lyman J. Gage,
former secretary of the treasury, now
a resident of San Diego.
The couple were married in
Los Angeles
about a year and a half ago.
Since
then they have lived in Los
Angeles
and suburbs.
The story of the life of
Woodill, before she became the
ward
of Lyman J. Gage, was a tragic
one.
Although the husband's
relatives are
very reticent about her
early childhood, it is understood
that she was
lost or stolen from her
parents in
Chicago when she was about two
years of age. Woodill several months ago caused an advertise-
ment to be
inserted in the Chicago papers asking
for information about any one who
had lost a child in that city about
eighteen years ago.
Mrs. Woodill was a blonde of small
stature,
light hair and of beautiful face and
figure.
Woodill met Huberts in
two or three days before
he returned west. He said
neither
his wife had known
Huberts
previously.
Gilbert Woodill, a brother of Gilbert
Woodill, while reticent in regard to
the
early life of the woman, said his
brother had told none of his relatives the object of this advertising.
but the letter stood he was searching
for the parents of his wife.
Gilbert Woodill met Miss
Edith
Thompson in New York
a little
over a year ago, and the courtship
was brief. After the wedding, Mr.,
Woodill visited at Point Loma, the
theosophical institution at San Diego,
where Lyman J. Gage lives. Some
weeks ago Woodill took his
wife to
Maryland and left her at the
home of
her foster parents,
Mr. and Mrs. L.
Thompson, in a
suburb of Baltimore.
Mrs. Woodill always
said that Lyman
J. Gage was her guardian,
but
never explained how this
came about, and apparently did not
know.
Gilbert Woodill, the
husband, says
that neither his wife nor himself had
met the man who is suspected of being her murderer until they went to
visit her foster parents in Maryland.
Lyman
J. Gage.
San Diego, Cal., June
24. The former secretary
of the treas-
ury.
until
today refused to tell how he came to
assume the relation toward Mrs. Woodill. With the bare admission that he
had received a telegram filing of her
death he refused to speak of her.
He then denied himself to an interview
and to keep him from
Chicago, June 24. Mr. Eli A.
Gage, daughter-in-law of former
Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J.
Gage when informed tonight of the
murder of Mrs. Edith M. Woodill, in
Maryland, said:
Mr. Gage first became interested
in the girl when he was secretary of
the treasury. She came to Washington with her mother and in some way
Mr. Gage met her. She was then 12
or 13 years old. Mr. Gage noticed
her musical talent and sent her to a
school to be educated. I do not know
how long he kept this interest in her,
but she never was his ward. Her
father died two or three years ago.
I do not remember his name, but I
know he lived in Maryland. I think
the mother also died a few years ago.
There never was any mystery about
her identity and the statement that
she was stolen when a baby is news
to me."
On March 22nd last an advertise-
ment appeared in a Chicago paper
asking for information concerning the
early life of Mrs. Gilbert Woodill of
Los Angeles. It was signed Gilbert
Woodill. In the advertisement Mr.
Woodill said his wife was supposed
to have been kidnapped and deserted
on the streets of Chicago when she
was two years old. Mr. Woodill
stated he was eager to have his wife's
past cleared up.
Mrs. Frank P.
Lyman J. Gage's
resides here, said
nothing of Mrs.
Cramall, sister of
second wife, who
tonight she knew
Woodill's past except that Mr. Gage had taken a great
interest in her.
HUBERTS ACCOMPANIED
IN HIS FLIGHT.
Baltimore, Md., June 24. Mrs.
Edith May Woodill was well known
here. She lived in Baltimore two
years, during which time she was a
student in vocal and piano branches
at the Peabody institute. While re-
siding with her foster father, Captain
Charles H. Thompson, she frequently
visited Baltimore. She had a wide
social acquaintance here.
Stage Robbers Elude Pursuit.
Nevada City, Cal., June 24. Search
for the robbers who held up the Down-
ieville stage, robbed the five passengers
and carried off the Wells-Fargo ex-
press company's strong box, five miles
from this city was continued today
with little prospect of success. The
posse is working on the theory that
the fugitive has gone south.
Moroccan Rebels Defeated.
Tangier, Morocco, June 24.
The
Viceroy's
troops of the sultan have been
victorious in an important engagement
fought outside of Fez, with the rebel
army under the command of Bu
Hmara. This is the engagement that had been
expected for some days and on which
the internal peace of Morocco de-
pended. Bu Hmara and his forces were
completely repulsed.
WOULD BROADEN SCOPE
OF WAR REVENUE ACT
Measure Upheld by Supreme
Court Advocated as Better
Adapted to Raising Revenue
Than Taft Proposition,
(By Morning Journal Special Wire
Washington, June 24. While agree-
ing that President Taft's corporation
tax idea is an easy and effective way
of securing needed revenue for the
government, if a graduated income
tax cannot be adopted, Senator New-
lands of Nevada, in addressing the
senate today, raised the question as
to whether it would not be wise in en-
acting the proposed excise law to fol-
low the exact text of the tax imposed
by the war revenue act and under
consideration in the Spreckels case, he
also asked whether equally beneficial results in the shape of revenue
and equally beneficial results in secur-
ing publicity of and supervision over
corporate concerns could not be se-
cured by it.
Mr. Newlands asserted that while
the tax which the president recom-
mends, it, as he declared, "an excise
tax on the privilege of doing business
as an artificial entity and of freedom
from joint partnership liability by
those who own stock" the tax sustain-
ed by the supreme court in the Spreck-
els case was not of this nature but
was simply a tax imposed on the oc-
currence of refining petroleum or su-
gar, whether done by a person, firm
or corporation.
"If the tax suggested by the president,-
continued Mr. Newlands, "is to
be regarded as an occupation tax, may
not the question be raised that the
rule of uniformity is broken by ap-
plying this occupation to corporations
alone and not to natural persons.
"If, however, it be held that the
suggested tax is, as the president as-
serts, a tax upon the privilege of do-
ing business as an artificial entity, that
is to say, a tax upon the right to be a
corporation, may it not be contended
that the corporate franchise is the
creation of the state sovereignty; that
the power to tax is the power to de-
stroy and that the nation has no po-
wer for this reason to tax the privi-
lege granted by the state."
Since the excise tax on refiners of
sugar and oils measured by their gross
receipts above a certain amount, has
been approved by the supreme court,
Mr. Newlands suggested that it could
be easily enlarged so as to include all
manufacturers of goods protected by
the tariff and that it could be made
as little vexatious as possible by reliev-
ing the small manufacturers from its
operations.

TONG WAR THREATENED
AS RESULT OF CRIME
Chinese Societies Vie With
Each Other in Efforts to Cast
Odium on Perpetrator of
Ghastly Crime.
(By Morning Journal Special Wire)
New York, June 24. With all tan-
gible indications of any near approach
to a solution of the murder of Elsie
Sigel, narrowing to the vanishing point
another day of the threefold investi-
gation by police, detectives and dis-
trict attorney ended tonight. Chun
Kin, after 24 hours of steady grilling
with but one intermission for sleep,
had a day of rest at last.
Either because the police despair of
getting more information out of him
or because they believe that if he is
left for a space to forget the details
of his first answers, he may entangle
himself in more contradictions, they
did not question him today.
The same stream of unsatisfactory
clues kept pouring in from Chinatown,
Newark, and the suburbs, and even
from the cities of the Pacific coast but
so far as the police here could deter-
mine tonight none has any substantial
basis.
A rumor that a war between the
Tongs was impending because of Chun
Kin's revelations to the police, found
momentary confirmation in the arrest
late today of one lone Chinaman with a
revolver lurked under his blouse but
the police said there was nothing to
connect him with any concerted plan
for an uprising.
The one bit of authentic information
which turned up today did not greatly
forward the search for Leon Ling.
This information came from Chu (lain,
who explained that the $210 advanced
to Chung Sin, Leon Ling's roommate,
did not come out of his private
purse. The police have been much
puzzled about this loan, because its
existence involved a contradiction.
Why should Chu (lain, who lived in
terror of his rival Leon Ling, lend
money to that rival's known intimate
friend. Chu (lain explained today that
the money was part of a loan fund
belonging to the Chinese empire re-
form association, of which he is treas-
urer. The society exists among other
things, for the purpose of supplying
funds to its members, who are entitled to draw on the treasurer in pro-
portion to the amount of their paid
up dues.
Chinatown is more deeply stirred
by the Sigel murder than by any event
of recent years. The Mongolians feel
their strife in the land that harbors them
is in danger. In one group
can be seen standing on the street
corners studying the cartoons in Eng-
lish papers, which they cannot read.
Two statements were issued today,
from the rival societies of which Chu
(lain and Leon Ling are members.
The Chinese Masons say Leon was
a member of the Chinese Empire Re-
form association and that they have
no interest in him whatever, other
than to aid in his capture. On the
other hand the Chinese Empire Re-
form association has sent a circular
letter to its 170 branches throughout
the United States instructing all to
watch for Leon Ling, who it is said
had deserted the society for the Ala
sons. A meeting was held tonight in the
Morning Star mission, in the heart of
Chinatown, to raise funds for running
down Leon Ling.
San Francisco, June 24. After a
series of reports that Leon Ling, the
suspected murderer of Elsie Sigel had
been captured aboard the Pacific Mail
liner Manchuria, the vessel, sailed for
the Orient shortly after 1 o'clock in
the day and the police returned to their
quarters empty handed.
Two hours before the ship's departure a
report was circulated that Leon Ling
had been captured. Later, however, it
was said that there was no ground
for the belief.
Cleveland, June 24. All traces of
the baggage received here from Sche-
nectady, N.Y., which is supposed to
have been checked by a Chinaman an-
swering the description of Leon Ling,
sought in connection with the murder
of Elsie Sigel, appears to have been
lost. The baggage arrived in Cleveland last Sunday and the original and
duplicated checks are in the possession
of the railway company, indicating
that not only was the baggage re-
ceived in Cleveland, but that it was claimed by its owner.
CHINAMAN
KILLED IN ALLOW.
Houston, Tex., June 24. It was
declared today that a Chinaman bear-
ing every resemblance to the picture
and identification marks of Leon Ling
was seen on a Southern Pacific train
Saturday just routed from New Or-
leans to Yuma, Ariz. The number of
the ticket the Chinaman was traveling
on was 163, form K, and purchased
in New York at the Southern Pacific
office, June 17.

GLASSES WORK MIRACLES

New York, June 24.
To reform the criminal

Dr. William Richards, who believes
if you want
to put glasses on
him, is the theory of
Dr. William Richards, who believes
that defective
vision impairs moral views. At the
Magdalene home he fitted glasses on
twenty inmates and all of them found
work when liberated and all kept
on working. One girl, considered
stupid and lazy, after getting glasses,
got a job and is still working.
District Attorney Convicted.
New York, June 24. Sanford B.
Hinson, personal counsel for K. Augustus
Hine, was convicted in the
United States circuit court today of
impeding the administration of justice by advising a grand jury wit-
nesses to evade service of subpoena.
COAST PASSENGER AGENT
NAMED BY ST. PAUL ROAD
Scuttle, June 24. Announcement
was made today that George V. Ulb-
hard, has been appointed assistant
general passenger agent of the Chi-
cago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound
railway, with headquarters in Seattle.
As the position of general passenger
agent has not been filled, Mr. Ulbhard
will virtually occupy that office.
Mr. Ulbhard was formerly general
passenger agent of the National lines
of Mexico and also of the Inter-Ocean
railway of Mexico.

the river gauge at the bridge registered 40.7 and was still rising. It
is estimated that 41 feet will be
reached by nightfall.

BEVERIDGE CHAMPIONS
THEIR CAUSE IN SENATE
Size of Packages and Packages
Cut During Spanish War
Never Restored by Heatless
Trust; Deluge of Oratory.
(By Morning Journal Special Wire
Washington, June 24. The course
of the senate today was the reverse of
its course yesterday. Instead of
acting on the schedules as in several
instances, yesterday, the entire day
was given over to speeches. There
were three lengthy addresses.
Senator Beveridge talked for about
four hours and was followed by Mr.
Bailey at almost as great length.
Mr. Newlands was the last of the
day's orators and had not long sur-
rendered the floor when the senate
adjourned.
Mr. Beveridge discussed an amend-
ment proposed by him regarding the
size of tobacco packages. He con-
tended that while the size of the
packages had been reduced during
the Spanish war with the end in view
of compelling the purchaser to pay the
war tax, those sizes had not been re-
stored nor the prices reduced, not
withstanding the removal of the tax,
thus practically giving the tobacco
manufacturers and especially the to-
bacco trust the advantage of the tax
even though it had not been in oper-
ation for about nine years. He de-
clared the trust had influenced legis-
lation for this purpose and asserted
it was being benefited to the extent
of many million dollars a year.
Mr. Bailey talked about free raw
material for the purpose of justifying
his vote as a democrat against the
free entry of iron ore, lumber and
hides. He declared that previous
to the Cleveland administration, the
established democratic policy was
opposition to the free admission
of raw material.
Mr. Newlands considered the
home tax question, giving consideration the president's
commission from
a corporation tax.
He discussed at length
the legislation of 1898 providing for a tax
of 20 cents
on the gross receipts of oil refiners, on
which the Spreckels case was decided by the supreme court, and which is
relied upon by the president as a pre-
cedent for the proposed corporation
tax. He pointed out especially that
the law of 1898 was applicable not
to corporations alone, but to every
person, firm, company and corpora-
tion carrying on such business. He
suggested that a tax applying only to
corporations might violate the con-
stitutional requirement of uniformity. When the making of prepared
speeches had been concluded, the
senate resumed consideration of
schedules and several amendments
were adopted. On motion of Mr.
Lodge, the duty of collodion and all
compounds or pyroxylin, etc., were
increased 10 per cent, ad valorem,
above the Dingley rate.
Explaining that this was intended
to meet Japanese competition of cel-
luloid manufactures, Mr. Lodge said
there was no question that the impor-
tations of this class of articles were
rapidly increasing. The house had
reduced the Dingley rate.
Mr. Aldrich proposed an increase
the duty on sole leather fixed by
the house from 5 to 10 per cent, ad
valorem, and on shoes from 10
to 15 per cent. Senator Bailey opposed
this as being an increase on articles
that should be without duty. Inci-
dentally he said there was less rea-
son for increasing the duty on sole
leather in view of the prospect of a
corporation tax.
By a viva voce vote the duty of
sole leather was increased as proposed
but a roll call was ordered on the
increase of shoes. It resulted in
a vote of the committee 32 to 24. The
entire affirmative vote was cast by
republicans, but Senators Bristow
(Tenn.), Crawford, Cummins, Curtis,
Culberson, La Follette and Nelson Jollif-
son, the democrats in opposing. The en-
tire paragraph relating to sole leather
and shoes, etc., was agreed to, "glove leather" being included in the list of articles dutiable
at 20 per cent, ad valorem. The ses-
sion concluded with a stormy scene
ending in an effort by Senator Bristow
to place hides, shoes, sole leather, etc.,
on the free list. Senator Aldrich
insisted when the Kansan offered his
amendment that the items had
been voted on. It was out of order to attempt to obtain another
vote. On Mr. Bristow's insisting
upon a vote, Mr. Aldrich turned
the substitute on the table, which
was agreed to 21 to 19. The question of
reconsideration was revived by Mr. Bristow, who wanted to have an un-
derstanding as to his rights in offering
amendments. Not being recognized he
declared the senate would not hasten
them and the hill in
reconsideration to curtail his right to
speak.
"I'd like to hear the senator," in-
terjected Senator Tillman, "but it is
7 o'clock and I want to get out of this
hot place."
In accordance with the older
rule, line of procedure adopted, the
senate at once adjourned. Mr. Bristow
holding the floor. The point of or-
der raised by Mr. Bristow as to his
right to offer a substitute for any par-
agraph after his adoption, was left
pending.
House Appropriations
(Continued from Page One)
Washington, June 24. On the eve
of the expiration of the current fiscal
year, the house today authorized an
emergency appropriation of $10,000,000
for defraying the expenses of taking the 11th decennial census.
In presenting the bill, Mr. Towns,
chairman of the committee on appro-
priations, said in need that unless the
money was forthcoming the census
bureau would be compelled to sus-
pend all business next Wednesday.
Notwithstanding this warning the bill
was filibustered all day by a member
of Arkansas, had forced a roll call
on a point of no quorum.
To get the numbers for
this vote
the sergeant at arms and his depu-
ties scouted the capitol under the
leadership of Speaker Cannon. About eighty
members were found comfortably
the senate, listening to tariff debate.
INJUNCTION SOUGHT
AGAINST EGG TRUST
Chicago, June 24. In a bill for an
injunction filed here today it is al-
leged that the Chicago Butter and
Egg board, through two committees,
arbitrarily fixes and gives out for
obligation as official figures, prices
for butter and eggs which are from
one half to one and one half cents
under the prices actually paid by
dealers.

COUNTRY FOR MISCREANTS
First Crime of the Character in
Annals of Bernalillo County
Arouses Intense Indignation;
Threats of Lynching.
One of the most horrible deeds in
the criminal annals of Bernalillo
county occurred between 9 and 10
o'clock last night, when two Mexicans,
both of whom were intoxicated, in-
tercepted Mr. and Mrs. Ogleby Major-
ibanks, of San Marcial, who were on
their way to Albuquerque after stepping off a Santa Fe freight train at
Abajo, three miles out of town, and
at the point of a revolver forced the
man to climb into a box car, where
he was held prisoner for an hour,
while the two fiends took the woman
a mile and a half distant to the Mu-
nitions powder house in the sandhills
and there robbed and assaulted her.
The boldness and ferocity with
which the men executed the outrage
is almost unbelievable.
Her slight frame convulsed with
hysterical sobs and almost out of her
mind from the terrible treatment to
which she was subjected, Mrs. Major-
ibanks last night told her story to
Sheriff Kred Heyn and Policeman Will Manniel, who rushed to
the scene of the crime when news of
it had been telephoned to the city.
According to Mrs. Majoribanks, she
and her husband boarded Santa Fe
freight train No. 54 at San Marcial
yesterday noon, arriving at Abajo at
9:40 last night. They left the caboose,
about a half mile south of the tele-
graph office at Abajo and had pro-
ceeded several hundred yards in the
direction of Albuquerque when they
were told to stop by two natives, one of whom held a large gun
in
his hand. Both men represented
themselves as Santa Fe officers and
inquired what business Mr. and Mrs.
Majoribanks had in the yard. The
explanation that they were strangers
and had only arrived a few moments
before on a freight train which was
still standing on the track, was
waived aside by the self-styled offi-
cers. They declared the woman and
her husband under arrest. Pointing
a gun at the man, they told him to
climb into a box car and bolted and
locked the door after him. They
then turned to the woman and told
her they would have to take her to
jail as a trespasser. She declined to
go and demanded to see their badges.
One of the men replied that he had
a star and that he would show her a
thousand stars if she didn't get a
move on and go where he told her to
go. The men then took her forcibly
by the arms and started with her
toward the sandhills, over a half
mile from the track. Pushing and
shoving her when she refused to go
any further, and leading her through
swamps and ditches, the trio finally
reached the foothills. They climbed
quite a distance into the hills, finally
coming to a halt near the powder
house owned by the Mcintosh Hard-
ware Company. Here the fiends
robbed the woman of her money, sin-
gle rings in all, a gold watch, and other
trinkets of small value. They then
tore most of her clothes from her
body and both men assaulted her.
After being held captive for over an
hour, the brutes escorted Mrs. Major-
ibanks to the foot of the hills, and
showed her the light in the Abajo tele-
graph office. They directed her to
keep the light in front of her and
go until she found the station and then go and release her husband from the box car.
More dead than alive Mrs. Major-
ibanks stumbled into the little tele-
graph office at Abajo and asked for
a drink of water. Operator Frank
gave her the water and noticing her
condition, inquired as to the cause.
She briefly explained what had hap-
pened and the operator quickly tele-
phoned to Albuquerque for assistance.
A small posse, consisting of
Watchman Newman of the Abajo
yards, several scale clerks and desk
men went out into the yards and
made a search for Mr. Majoribanks,
going from car to car in an effort to
locate him. The husband, however,
had been liberated in the meantime,
after being held prisoner for over an
hour. A man passing on horseback
heard his cries for help and notified
Deputy Sheriff Felipe Trujillo, at San
Jose, who went to the yard and freed
the imprisoned man. Majoribanks
was almost out of his head and told
Trujillo an incoherent tale about the
hold-up. Trujillo was at first of the
opinion that Majoribanks was a lun-
atic, but finally believed his story and
quickly organized a posse of men to
