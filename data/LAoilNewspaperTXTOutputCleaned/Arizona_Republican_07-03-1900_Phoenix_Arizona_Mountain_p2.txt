NEW YORK.

It was predicted in this paper some
days ago that the Kansas City platform
would be what the ever-perennial candi
date, Mr. Bryan, wants it to be, in spite of the
weak opposing views of members of the great
Democratic party in the east. It is es
pecially significant that David Bennett
Hill, who four years ago represented
the other extreme wing of the party
and who for four years previously had
sulked in Wolfert's Roost against so
great a man as Mr. Cleveland, and
who had the hardihood to defy Tam
many Hall, should now bow to Bryan and Company.

At the power of Mr. Bryan, Mr.
Hill seems to limp to Lincoln to formally
give himself up. He will return to
Kansas City chained to the conquer
or's car. It is a pitiful sight to see
such a man as Hill has been, whatever
he may be now, brought under the will
of such a man as Mr. Bryan. It was
claimed for Hill at one time that he
was a statesman. We do not think
that such a claim has ever been suc
cessfully made in behalf of Mr. Bryan.
Hill has never enjoyed the reputation of
being a political student. As the New
York Sun truthfully observed some
months ago, he has kept himself so
busy talking since he flashed athwart
the Democratic and populistic horizon
that he has had no time to study. The
only surcease he has given himself
from oratory was while he was com
posing a silly book which has been al
most forgotten, but whose title we be
lieve was "The First Battle," in which
it was generally indicated that Mr.
Bryan intended to have another go at
the presidency. The most remarkable
thing we remember in connection with
that literary work is a statement in the
preface by Mr. Bryan's wife that Mr.
Bryan had won fame at college by his
superior broad jump.

Statesmanship may sometimes be in
intuitive, like wisdom in a woman. Na
poleon was the greatest statesman of
his time without any especial training,
though he was always a student and,
unlike Mr. Bryan, was habitually
silent.

Mr. Bryan's ascendancy to the abso
lute mastery of a great party of a
great republic is one of the most re
markable and unexplainable things in
all political history. It has only two
counterparts—the shaking of the
throne of England by Wat Tyler,
and the rise of Joan of Arc. The for
mer was raised by the abuses of his
times; the latter is said to have been a
divine instrument, and both inspired
their followers by their early successes
and actually performed the work set
for them to do, though neither lived to
enjoy the grand results.

Mr. Bryan is wholly without pro
vocation. There are no abuses for him
to correct and there seems to have
been no recent selection of a divine in
strument. Mr. Bryan has never led
his deluded followers within sight of
success, and the battle cries with
which he urged them on four years ago
have all since then been proved to be
false.

In spite of his failure he is a more
masterful leader of his party today
than ever. We have little doubt that
the delusion of the Democrats is so
great that, defeated as he will be in
November, he can force himself upon
the party in 1904.

There was printed in a California
paper a few days ago a telegram pur
porting to be an Associated Press dis
patch sent out from Phoenix and which
reflected seriously upon the Mexican
population of this city.

The disreputable "independent" Ga
zette, of which McCord is manager and
chief director, published the lie that
that dispatch had been sent out from
Phoenix over the name of Charles C.
Randolph, the editor of this paper.

The lie seemed too unworthy of notice
to be passed by, but since then
the worse element of the Mexican pop
ulation (for there are bad Mexicans
just as there are bad Americans), stim
ulated by the disreputable Gazette,
have sought to create an impression
among their more reputable country
men that somebody connected with
The Republican office has done them
an injury. As a matter of fact, which
the managers of both telegraph com
panies will verify, no such Associated
Press dispatch was ever sent out from
Phoenix over the name of Mr. Rand
olph or any other person. It has been
ascertained that the paper which
printed that dispatch had received a
story from a Phoenix correspondent
who is in no way connected with The
Republican. That story, we have also
learned, was not printed as was re
ceived, but was garbled and twisted
into the sensational form in which it
appeared. That it was printed as an
Associated Press dispatch was prob
ably not intentional, for the average
newspaper would prefer to show its
enterprise by labeling its dispatches
"special" or "exclusive."

On this basis of misrepresentation,
those two pestiferous persons, De la
Loma and McCord, the former a refugee
from Mexico and the latter from Wis
consin, set about stirring up a race
feeling.

Bankruptcy is not a recommendation
to business men. A man who embarks
in the newspaper business after having
failed in a marked manner in the com
mercial or speculative field, does not
bring with him a guaranty of success
in journalism. The newspaper busi
ness is as much a business as mer
chandising, banking or any commer
cial enterprise. One who has failed in
any of these lines cannot hope to ben
efit himself or his patrons in the news
paper world.

The $10,000,000 fire in New York is
something to be proud of as a fire,
though the insurance companies can
hardly be supposed to be elated over it.
For the area covered, the loss in prop
erty and life is one of the greatest in
the history of fires on this continent,
and in the volume of loss stands only
behind the Chicago and Boston con
flagrations.

A DETECTIVE'S PHILOSOPHY.
The detective and the man about
town get to be a good deal alike in
their views. They expect to run up
against crooks.

Half the world can't understand how
the other half keeps out of jail.

It always did puzzle me that the
tough part of a city should be called
the tenderloin.

The safest way for strangers to get
acquainted with the tough section of a
city is to study it out on a good map.

Countrymen will often rush in where
detectives fear to tread unarmed.

Good detectives and first-class crooks
know each other at sight.

There is a sort of handwriting in
crime. You can often pick out the gen
uine criminal by the looks of a job that
he has done.

Crooks sometimes give themselves
away by keeping watch of the detec
tives. The criminal is usually a nervous
fellow and the detective isn't.

One of the detective's great difficul
ties is in managing to get along on a
small salary. That isn't usually men
tioned in the story books.

The "Old Sleuth" of fiction is scarce,
because there isn't crime enough to
keep such a fellow fairly busy.

One dime novel detective would be a
sufficient police force for San Fran
cisco, New York and Chicago, covering
the three cities in a bunch.

Crime is one of those plants that likes
shade. It will not grow very well out
in the open.

It is frequently so difficult to get
criminals that a fellow might think
they are scarce.

The man who can find merely traces
of a criminal isn't much of a detective.
The traces are left around everywhere.

If you're arresting a desperate man,
it's best to save your politeness until
you have him locked up. He'll be
more inclined to reciprocate then.

Never take any chances with a
criminal. He'll play odds. San Francisco Examiner.
