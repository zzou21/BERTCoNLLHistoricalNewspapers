SEWERAGE SYSTEM
DOMINANT QUESTION
The Tempe Council Continues to In-
vestigate. Visit of Inspection to
California Apparent Result.
Lengthy discussions of the proposed
sewer system for Tempe continue to
be the important feature of business
with the common council and until the
various council members pay a visit to
Los Angeles and adjoining coast towns
during the next two months it will
likely remain such. The local officials
met in special session at the chamber in
the city hall on Wednesday evening,
were called to order by Mayor J. T.
Birchett and proceeded to get down to
business, but beyond thinning out the
menacing points in the construction of
the sewer it was all to no avail.
Plans as drawn up by P. K. Fuller of
Mesa, the same gentleman who laid
out the Tempe water works system,
are now at the disposal of the council
and have considered to the most min-
ute detail. Mr. Fuller, owing to urgent
business elsewhere, particularly in Los
Angeles, has found it so far impossible
to be present at the special sessions of
the council and so the city officials are
working the whole thing out for them-
selves. In lieu of Engineer Fuller's plans the
council now has another scheme under
way, the results of which depend upon a
visit by the council members to the
coast. There are various alterations
to the present plans that the council
after a detailed investigation believe
can be made. If successful the changes
will mean a much more adequate sew-
er system and a decided decrease in the
cost of its construction.
For the express purpose of looking
into this sewerage method, an exact
counterpart of which may be found at
a California coast town near Los An-
geles, several of the Tempe council
members will leave here the latter part
of this month. Their report will be
submitted upon their return in Septem-
ber and definite action will very likely
be taken at that time.

UNSIGHTLY FACE SPOTS
Are cured by Dr. Hobson's Eczema
Ointment, which heals all skin erup-
tions. No matter how long you have
been troubled by itching, burning, or
scaly skin humors, just put a little of
that soothing antiseptic, Dr. Hobson's
Eczema Ointment, on the sores and the
suffering stops instantly. Healing be-
gins that very minute. Doctors use
it in their practice and recommend it.
Mr. Ahernan, of Littlestown, Pa., says:
"Had eczema on forehead; Dr. Hob-
son's Eczema Ointment cured it in two
weeks." Guaranteed to relieve or money
refunded. All druggists, or by mail.

THE FOURTH IN TEMPE.
That Tempe people will stand by
today and watch and assist others to
celebrate the glorious Fourth of July,
there is but little doubt. Few if any
entertainments will be pulled off in
Tempe that would justify the as-
semblage of those looking for the
place where they can get the most
for their money in the way of amuse-
ment. The only formal observance of
the Fourth was the dance given last
evening at the Cosmopolitan hall by
the Happy Thirty dance club. To-
day those who have not hied them-
selves to Prescott to take part in the
Frontier Day celebration or to Tuc-
son to root for the local ball team,
will remain at home and enjoy the
quiet of life. A show at the Goodwin
Airdome tonight will be the special
attraction of the evening. Four thous-
and feet of pictures, the best and
most appropriate procurable, will be
run, the first reel to be re-run at
the conclusion of the regular pro-
gram. In view of the fact that the
town authorities absolutely forbid the
display of fireworks within the city
limits except on personal property, or
the north side of the Hayden canal,
Tempe again falls behind in its ob-
servance of the Fourth. It is likely
that there will be a display of fire-
works made from the top of the butte
this evening by individual parties. In
all, the Fourth of July in Tempe bids
fair to pass with but a comparatively
miniature observance.

RID YOUR CHILDREN OF WORMS.
You can change fretful, ill-tempered
children into healthy, happy young-
sters, by ridding them of worms. Toss-
ing, rolling, grinding of teeth, crying
out while asleep accompanied with in-
tense thirst, pains in the stomach and
bowels, feverishness and bad breath,
are symptoms that indicate worms.
Kickapoo Worm Killer, a pleasant can-
dy lozenge, expels the worms, regu-
lates the bowels, restores your children
to health and happiness. Mrs. J. A.
Brisbin, of Elgin, Ill., says: "I have
used Kickapoo Worm Killer for years,
and entirely rid my children of worms.
I would not be without it." Guaranteed.

THE STORES WILL CLOSE.
All Tempe business houses, drug
stores included, have signified their
intention of observing the Fourth of
July by closing their establishments
for the day. The drug stores at
latest reports had concluded to ob-
serve Sunday hours, 11:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. In view of the closing
today, but few observed the regular
Thursday afternoon holiday yester-
day.
FOR CUTS, BURNS AND BRUISES
In every home there should be a
box of Bucklen's Arnica Salve, ready
to apply in every case of burns, cuts,
wounds or scalds. J. L. Polanco, Del
Valle, Tex., R. No. 2, writes: "Buck-
len's Arnica Salve saved my little
girl’s cut foot. No one believed it
could be cured." The world's best
salve. Only 25c. Recommended by
all druggists.—(Advertisement)

A ROOSEVELT TRIP.
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Hall of Tempe
and nephew, Louie H. Hall of Niagara
Falls, composed an auto party to the
Roosevelt dam on Wednesday. The
entire trip was made on that day, an
early start being gained from here
and the return made in the early
hours of the evening.
BACK FROM THE COAST.
Curt W. Miller, editor of the Tempe
Daily News, returned on Wednesday
from a short visit to the coast where
he went to attend the wedding of
his son Frank C. Miller to Miss Clara
E. H. Paxton at Riviera, Cal., last
Saturday afternoon. A greater share
of his time was spent at Pasadena
where Mrs. Miller is located.
THE DOG CAMPAIGN.
Marshal M. C. Browning is at a
loss to find a competent dog catcher.
And in consequence he has so far
found it impossible to carry on his
campaign against the stray canines
of Tempe, due to come off at this
time of year. Comparatively the
stray dogs are a decidedly scarce
article just now, yet in accordance
with the city ordinance, the war
against dogs not licensed by their
owners to live is due. The first of
July each year is the date set for
paying this license and so far a
greater part of the taxes for the fis-
cal year have been paid. With the
hiring of a competent dog catcher
which the marshal proposes to do
just as quickly as one looms in sight
the annual war will be waged.
Horrors
of War.
"That war correspondent speaks
feelingly of the horrors of war."
"So?"
"Yes; seems he spent most of the
time camping in a Balkan hotel."

MESA BUSINESS MAN
SECURES LIFE PARTNER
Wedding of Marshall Mosbarger to
Mrs. Etta Lucetta Crandall.
Marshall Mosbarger, owner of the
Mosbarger building and leading shoe-
man of the town, was married on
Wednesday night at 8 o'clock, to
Mrs. Etta Lucetta Crandall, a charm-
ing lady who has long been a resi-
dent of the Gem City. The ceremony
was performed in the parlor of the
A. N. Smith undertaking establish-
ment, Justice Irwin officiating. Mr.
Smith was master of ceremonies and
presided with the dignity that marks
his general demeanor. Ephriam S.
Anderson and John F. Hemperly were
the official witnesses. A large number
of invited guests were present,
and after the ceremony and the usual
congratulations, busy waiters supplied
all with an abundance of ice cream
and cake. The relatives present
were: Mrs. Eb. Tripp, mother of the
bride, Mr. Wm. Tripp, Mr. and Mrs.
Fred Tripp, Mrs. Elsie Barnum, sister
of the bride, and Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Mosbarger, who came in from Gilbert
to see their uncle married. An auto
load of friends from Phoenix, con-
sisting of Mr. and Mrs. Al Miller, Mr.
Timkins, Mrs. Timkins, were also pre-
sent, but owing to delay on account
of a bad piece of road, did not arrive
until after the marriage rites had
been solemnized.
The couple will make their home in
the family cottage on East First Ave-
nue, and Mr. Mosbarger will continue
business at the old stand.
After the invited guests had depart-
ed, and the couple had retired to their
home, an uninvited band gave the
newlyweds a serenade not down on
the program. Mr. Mosbarger was
game, however, and all the boys
received a good cigar and his bless-
ing.
BEAR HUNTERS.
W. E. Bowen and Ed W. Jones will
leave Saturday for the White moun-
tains and expect to be absent a
couple of months. While they an-
nounce their mission to be one deal-
ing principally with the capture of
trout, they have taken a bear gun
along, and expect to win the prize
of a fine saddle horse offered for the
pelt of a bear that makes tracks
measuring fourteen inches across. Mr.
Bowen says that the man offering the
prize might just as well turn over
the horse now, as he is sure Ed will
never stop until he has treed and
roped that bear. Mr. Jones is rather
modest in speaking of the matter, but
leaves the impression that if Mr.
Bigfoot Bruin has any regard for its
hide, it will take to the remote
jungles before the hunting party ar-
rives.
