He formerly was secretary of the  
Riverside Chamber of Commerce, and  
has had active service in the news de-  
partment of the Los Angeles Times.  
Malcolm Fraser, formerly secretary of  
the El Paso Chamber of Commerce and  
now secretary to the governor, wrote  
President C. Fred Brackett, warmly  
endorsing Mr. Evans for the position.  
The family of the new secretary is yet  
in Los Angeles but will come to Mesa  
as soon as arrangements can be made  
for a suitable residence. Mr. Evans is  
in the same condition of every other  
newcomer, finding a dearth of vacant  
residences.  
At the same meeting the directors  
discussed the advisability of moving  
the club headquarters to some more  
central location and it was decided  
to make investigation as to the differ-  
ent buildings available for the purpose.  

MESA, July 11.—Thomas C. Evans  
of Los Angeles has been selected by the  
directors of the Mesa Commercial Club  
as secretary. Mr. Evans, who was not  
present at the meeting, was notified by  
phone of his appointment. He came  
over from Phoenix where he had been  
stopping and now is at work at his new  
duties.  
Mr. Evans evidently is well qualified  
for the position of publicity man and  
general promoter for the town and val-  
ley.  

Mrs. Edith Salisbury, home economics  
expert of the state university, phoned  
over yesterday that she would be here  
Thursday morning for a canning dem-  
onstration. Inasmuch as the one to  
whom she phoned knew nothing of any  
arrangements the matter of where and  
when it is up in the air.  

New Seminary Superintendent  
Prof. George Haws of St. George  
Academy has been chosen to take  
charge of the seminary work of the L.  
D. S. church at Mesa. The duties are  
those which were handled last term by  
C. N. Perkinson, and in part comprise  
a noonday lesson to such school pu-  
pils as care to attend. The sessions  
were held in the Second Ward Chapel.  

Letter From Walter Lesueur  
Walter Lesueur, the son of Mr. and  
Mrs. J. T. Lesueur, who some time  
since started for New Zealand on a  
missionary tour, writes home from Ha-  
waii, where he will work in the Hawaiian Islands.  

A Fine Home Sold  
George A. Johnson of the Toggery  
has become a full-fledged rancher. He  
has sold his handsome bungalow resi-  
dence on West Main Street to A. H.  
Gibson of Tempe and has moved out  
to the ranch recently purchased by the  
Toggery owners from Allison Brothers.  
Mr. Gibson will move into his new  
home at once.  

On Sick List  
Frank Cluff of the Orange Blossom  
was confined at home yesterday by illness.  

Found Stolen Bicycle  
Special Officer D. A. LeBaron, while  
on the lookout for a stolen bicycle be-  
longing to Jack Hurlowe, ran across a  
young Indian with the wheel, the num-  
ber being conclusive evidence as to its  
identity. The Indian said he had  
bought the bike about a month ago  
from a white man in Phoenix and that  
since that time the man had disap-  
peared. His story did not convince the  
officers, but in the absence of further  
testimony, he was dismissed with a  
severe warning.
