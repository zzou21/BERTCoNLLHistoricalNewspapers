Society circles at Long Beach are
agog over the announcement made
yesterday that the "Kirmess," the
spectacular production which has
been given in a number of interior
cities of California during the past
winter, will be staged on the tennis
courts of the Virginia Hotel in Au
gust. Taken, with the yachting regat
tas and tennis tournaments already
announced, this production will fur
nish the "queen city" with one of the
busiest and brightest seasons of re
cent years.
The Kirmess is extremely popular,
and as the cast will be made up en
tirely of Long Beach society people,
guests at the Virginia Hotel and sum
mer visitors, it promises to become
even more so at this time. Rehear
sals will begin August, continuing
until the last week in August, when
three performances will be given. A
large number of people who have
taken part in Kirmess in other cities
have signified their intention of com
ing to Long Beach in order to take
more part in it, and the management
has promised to find places for
all.
With this production to be staged,
the prediction, made earlier in the
season that the present year would
be the most successful in the history
of the "Atlantic City of the Pacific
Coast," is coming true, and summer
visitors from New Mexico, Texas, Ari
zona, Nevada and Utah, as well as
California, are flocking to the beaches.
Yachting is attracting a great deal
of attention from the visitors, the first
race of the season being run Sunday
for the Commodore's cup. The largest
crowd ever witnessing a yacht race
on this coast attended. Early in July
all the sailing and racing yachts in
southern waters will be anchored off
the coast of the Virginia Hotel for
the first meet of the Southern Cali
fornia Yachting Association, recently
formed in San Diego, with Commodore
A. J. Mitchell of the Sunset Club at
its head.

a thoughtful parent must desire to have; closest to this end are the location of the school, removed
from the temptations and distractions of town or city; the
fineness of the climate, the excellence of its buildings and
other equipment, and the beauty and extent of its grounds,
with the wide range of foothills surrounding them. We are
glad to have our patrons and graduates consulted. For
