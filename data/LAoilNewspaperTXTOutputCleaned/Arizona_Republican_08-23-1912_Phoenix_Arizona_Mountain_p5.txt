TAX BOARD IS

HOME AGAIN

And When It Arrived It
Found That Things Had
Been "Happening" Dur
ing Its Little Jaunt to
Nogales

MASKED

Dome Refreshment Parlors
on First Avenue Scene
of an Old Time Gun Play
Bluff Last Night at Late
Hour

The state tax commission returned
yesterday morning from Nogales
where the commission held a joint
conference with the county board of
supervisors sitting as a board of
equalization. The subject of conference
was lands and cattle and the
proper valuation of the World's Fair
mine. As a result of the conference
the county's valuation was elevated
approximately $200,000. The total val
uation of that county is now about
two and a half millions.
The commission now has the returns
from all the counties except Apache

where there was some kind of a
tangle that delayed the transmission
of the assessment roll. It has wired
to Apache county for its returns and
expects to receive them soon, so the
entire valuation of the state may be
announced probably within a week.
In this connection the commission
and board of equalization is con
siderably wrought up over the action
of the county boards of Yavapai and
Cochise, sitting as county boards of
equalization. It appears that after
Yavapai county transmitted to the
tax commission its abstract of the
assessment roll, which figures were
used in fixing the state tax rate, the
county board reduced the valuation
of patented mines approximately 25
per cent and also reduced other min
ing property. It also appears that
using Yavapai for an example Cochise
took similar action. This it is con
tended by the state board, is exceed
ing the authority of the county board
and the auditor and state board of
equalization have wired to the Cochise
county officials to that effect. The
commission believes there is co
operation among the mining interests
to lower valuations by playing one
county against another, and the com
mission believes the proceedings have
gone too far for any such work to
be legal.
o
NAVAL BILL SIGNED

Shortly after 11 o'clock last night a
small man masked with a handker
chief, entered Miller's Dome saloon on
First avenue opposite the court house
and throwing a gun down on the bar
keeper made him stand back while he
went through the cash register and
took what money there was in sight, a
few dollars in change. Then he faded.
The robber entered by the front door
and left by the rear door. There was
no one in the saloon but the barkeeper
and the porter. Neither was in a po-

sition to argue the matter as the only

sort of an argument worth while in a
case of that kind, was in the hands
of the outlaw.
The police were summoned promptly
but the robber had gone even before
the officers were called. The barkeep
er gave the police a fair description of
the man who is perhaps 30 years old,
clean shaven, of light complexion, wore
dark clothes and is rather small. The
police do not know his name but from
the description given they believe they
know him by sight.
This is the first incident of a "wild
and woolly" sort that has occurred
here for so long that it is almost start
ling. People had nearly forgotten that
there ever was such a thing as a sa
loon hold up in this part of the
country. It seems like old times.

You Will Find It Pays to Take Good
Care of Animals' Comfort.
If comfort of hogs while in transit to
market be carefully provided the own
er will be repaid. Initial preparation
for the transportation of the hogs
should be planned with the object of
maintaining as nearly as possible the
favorable conditions under which he
has been brought to a marketable stage
of perfection. From the farm to the
loading point too much care cannot be
exercised. Use every available means
to effect this transfer with the least
possible worry and excitement of the
animal. In loading pens make certain
that food is available if his appetite
for working. See that an abundance
of pure water is accessible and that
drinking troughs are clean. Let him
have food and drink right up to the
time of loading.
Before loading make a close inspec
tion of cars. Clean out all old bedding,
manure, and so forth. In summer
spread a layer of good clean sand or
small gravel three or four inches deep
over the floor of the car. "Exhaust"

j cinders, if available, mix well with the

sand. If the hogs are to be confined
in the car for a period exceeding that
which has usually elapsed between
feeding periods put in ear corn, the
amount to be determined by the prob
able time the animals will be en route.
If the weather is warm it is wise to
cool the hogs by sprinkling with cool
water, but care should be exercised in
putting cold water over the backs of
the swine if they are very warm. A
little cold water on the back of a very
hot hog often causes his death. In
winter, especially in very cold weather,
put in a liberal bedding of clean straw
or hay and on top of it ear corn in
amount depending on the conditions.
In no instance, either in winter or
summer, should hogs be loaded in
cars in which there is an accumulation
of old bedding or manure. The heat
generated by the swine causes fermen
tation of the old manure. This in turn
heats or scalds the hog, causing shrink
age, besides so affecting his appetite
that when unloaded he will neither
eat nor drink as he should. Moreover,
his appearance is affected to the detri
ment of his selling value.
Experience demonstrates that it is a
mistake to keep hogs off water for an
unusual period before starting them

for market. As a rule, better kills are
obtained and less shrinkage experienc-

ed if no unusual or extreme measures
be taken. Weight is held far better if
feed and water in usual rations are
supplied at as near the customary pe
riods as circumstances will allow.

RUSSIA HERSELF AGAIN

What Her Recuperation Means

to Her Neighbors

The world may or may not be con

scious of the fact that Russia is once

again engaged in her old game of
aggression upon weaker nations or

that she has as far recovered from
the disasters of the Manchurian cam
paign of seven years ago that she
is now able to pursue her policy of
expansion with all the swagger and
ease that were so conspicuously hers
in the years before 1904. Her finan
cial condition has never been as
sound as at present. She has com
pleted a thorough reorganization of
her army, so that she can, if need
be, muster 1,800,000 infantry and
100,000 cavalry at a moment's notice
on the frontiers of Germany and
Austria. And this enormous army
is now entirely free for use wherever
Russia chooses to send it, for her
relations with the Triple Alliance,
Germany, Austria and Italy, are at

present so cordial that there is vis-
ible uneasiness concerning them in of Russia of the intentions of Japan.

that one English statesman has de
clared: "Without Russia where should
we be?" it is all due to the German
navy. Russia is only too glad to let
Germany take care of the trouble
some English watch dog, so that she
herself may do whatever she chooses
in other parts of the world. Whoever
has instigated the kaiser to build
more dreadnoughts surely deserves
the hearty thanks of the czar.
Advancing along the line of the
least resistance, which is her tradi
tional policy, Russia's activities are
now directed towards China, Persia
and Turkey. Whatever the Chinese
may think of the declaration of inde
pendence of outer Mongolia under
Russian protection, the world cannot
fail to know that this territory is
lost forever to China. Not only this,
but what Russia desires in the way
of availing herself to the weakness
of China, occasioned by the revolu
tion, is laid down with unblushing
frankness by a writer in the Novoe
Vremya, a Russian national organ,
of February 4th.

France as well as in Great Britain

Ten years ago world politics re
volved around the pivot of the ri
valry between Russia and Great
Britain in Turkey, Central Asia and
the Far East. The Russo-Japanese
war, in a sense, may be considered
as a phase of that rivalry, with Ja
pan fighting England's battle to put
a check on the Russian advance to
the open sea. The situation of
world politics has since undergone
a complete change, not due to the
defeat of Russia in the Manchurian
campaign, but to the rise of Germany
as a naval power. It is a potent
fact that if the British navy be de
feated by that of Germany, the world
girdling British empire must inev
itably crumble to pieces. England is
therefore now engaged in a break
neck race with Germany for the goal
of naval supremacy, and has neither
the time nor the power to continue
her rivalry with Russia. And this
being so, she has concluded ententes
with France and Russia, and attaches
such importance to Russia's good will

The latter regards China as a mar
ket for the products of her ever
increasing industries and is therefor"
in the same line of policy with Eng
land and America for upholding "the
open door" and the territorial integ
rity of China. The return of Russia,
with her territorial ambition and tar
iff barriers, is, therefore, to say the

the Indian empire.
The recent development of the
Turco-Italian war all indicate the
desire of Russia to throw her influ
ence on the side of Italy as against
Turkey. The Turco-Italian war is in
a stage in which neither belligerent
can advance or retreat. Italy cannot
subdue Turkey unless the attack be
made at Constantinople, which task
is pronounced by military experts in
Europe to be too perilous even for

the Italian army or navy, or both,
and Turkey, therefore, can be brought

of her dependencies. Italy.

ALWAYS SOME REMEDY

Russian action in Persia is describ
ed as "flat burglary" by Sidney Lew
in the Fortnightly Review.
According to the London Times
correspondent, "Russia will probably
be forced to take over the adminis
tration of Persia, and she and Great

Britain must establish either a dual

control or separate protectorates." It
means that Great Britain in Persia
finds herself with an open and con
terminous frontier alongside that of
a great military power. Absorbed in

her rivalry with Germany, England ) Be a live wire read The Repub-

has no time to think of the safety of Moan Want Ads.

The advance of Russia is the ad
vance of the policy of aggression and
conquest to which China, Persia and
Turkey, each and all, bear a bitter
testimonial. Germany, Austria and
Italy will be very willing partners in
the Russian ambitions. It is provoca
tive of anger that not a single nation
of the world raises a warning finger
at Russia, as Japan did seven years
ago. Oriental Review.

the Rosenthal Murder

NEW YORK, Aug. 22. In their
search for a popular candidate for
governor of New York this fall the
democratic leaders are seeking a
man who will help Governor Wilson
in gaining votes with which to carry
the state. Such a man, in the opin
ion of many of the men prominent
in the councils of the party, is Wil
liam G. McAdoo, who built the Hud
son tunnel. Mr. McAdoo is forty-nine
years old and, like Governor Wilson,
is of southern birth and parentage.
He was a delegate from this state to
the Baltimore convention, but he was
not conspicuous in New York politics
before until Governor Wilson became
a candidate for the nomination for
president. He was a stanch Wilson
advocate before the Baltimore con
vention and has been made vice
chairman of the democratic national
committee at Governor Wilson's own
behest.

Charm of Farm Life.

Farm life is often spoken of as
being monotonous, but is there
any reason why it should be?
The environment of farming is
far more varied, more interest
ing and more attractive than

city life. Those who must sit
at a desk in a shower of dust
and endure heat during summer
and dreary weather in winter for
from eight to twelve hours a
day may find life monotonous.
