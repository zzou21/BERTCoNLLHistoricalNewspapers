Rusted Mitt Bill
May Strengthen in Run.

PHOENIX BATTING ORDER.

Rusted Mitt Will
Play It Foot in Trenches

Will Try to Hold Heavy
Striking Messages; New
Backstop Lester to be Seen for
First Time Here.

A necessary shift in the Phoenix
line-up today will place one new player
in the field and several old ones back
in the places whence they were once
derricked. Still, the change will not
really weaken the team, while the addi
tion of a new battery will put the
heavy hitting Mesa players to their
best pace to keep up.
Rusted Mitt Bill Barngrover of Texas
League fame will occupy the mound,
and Lester Cook, the new catcher will
receive. Cook arrived yesterday from
Sacramento to be backstop for the lo
cals. He is a California State Leaguer,
lately with the Coast League farming
clubs. He is said to be easily the equal
of Nutt and Morris, the two stars be
hind the bat in the Salt River Valley
League.

The way Phoenix will bat today.
Cut this out and paste in your
hat to copy on score card at this
afternoon's game.
Robinson, left field.
Franz, third base.
Ferguson, second base.
Ritchie, short stop.
Clow, center field.
Yates, first base.
Warren, right field.
Cook, catcher.
Barngrover, pitcher.

At the park, next Thursday afternoon. At
that game the women fans will all be
admitted free, and each will be given a
chance to win the prize of one season
ticket for two. The name contest has
been split into two parts. The one will
cover the park and the other the team.
So there is chance for two prizes,
which will undoubtedly be offered by
the management. In addition to the
prizes, the club will also give a hand
some remembrance to each feminine
fan, some little souvenir that will in
the course of human events draw
memories of the first Ladies’ Day at
the new park.

A new sensation will be sprung by
the Phoenicians in the Thursday game.
The initial sack will be occupied by
Signorino Leo Togneri, who is called
the fastest first baseman outside or
ganized ball.
In an endeavor to break the winning
streak of the Highlanders, Ritchie will
send his men into the game this after
noon with instructions to hit, steal and
grab everything in sight lying around
loose. No single opportunity will be
lost intentionally to advance the
baserunner. And Rusted Mitt Bill is
going to lay that old chucking bone of
his bare to the shoulder in the supreme
effort to send the Mesa stickers back
to the bench in one, two, three order,
or make them pop up the easy ones
that always get glommed.
The game this afternoon will be hard
fought from start to finish. Phoenix is
desperately anxious to stop the run
aways, and will do the best ever to ac
complish it, this very day. Ritchie said
last night he was not over confident
this time, and would make everyone
work right down to the last sub. "We
have five days to rest now, and the
boys are going to use everything we
have to strip these here scared rabbits
from the southside. With good luck at
the plate, we ought to win, for I think
our field will work as good as Mesa’s."

Maroons at Tempe.
If the schedule tells true, the Ma
roons will play Tempe this afternoon on
the Bears’ own grounds. There has
been some disarrangement of that
schedule, however, the Tempe manager
protesting he cannot pull a paying
crowd in his home town when the
other southside team is playing in the
capital.
But it is now certain that the south
side manager is over being stage struck
in the pocket book and the game will
be played.

SPORT EDITOR GETS
DECISION OVER FAN

Scheduled Ten Thousand Word Crab
fest Goes to Publicity Man on
His Own Award; Police
Interfere.

In a terrific ten thousand word
crabbing match friendly like the last
tie the Republican sport editor awarded
himself a clean cut decision on para
graphs over the Daly fan. If the
sport editor can award anybody a
match, there is no reason why he
should not give himself much the best
of it.

Before an audience that was
split about even, one section cheering
for one and t’other section rooting
just as hard opposite, the two went
at it hammer and tongs, displaying
not only old head by the ram but a
knowledge in the use of English not
often seen outside the big limit

News Notes From The
Local Shooting World

Compiled by "Pinny Rob"
From now until September the white
wing and dove shooting is at its best.
Every hunter that goes out gets the
limit, and most of the birds shot are
squabs, very fat, and the finest eating
game bird in the world. There is quite
good shooting now within five miles of
town, but the best shooting is at Ever
green, on the Arizona canal toward
Granite Reef, at Hanson and Kyrene
south of Tempe; at Peoria, and along
the Agua Fria, west of town.
Some of the local dentists got the
limit at Hanson’s in about an hour’s
shooting yesterday afternoon. In the
party were Doctors O’Connell, Fowler
and Ritchie. One of the shooters said:
"Driving out last Sunday we noticed
a couple of hunters who had taken
their families out for the day; they
were broiling white wings for dinner,
over mesquite coals. A day’s outing of
this kind is much enjoyed by the wo
men and children, particularly if camp
is made near the river or an irrigating
canal, and helps to break up the mon
otony of the summer."
White Mountain Fishing.
Pinney & Robinson received a letter
from Chas. G. Bryan yesterday, from
the White Mountains, ordering more
fishing tackle. He says that the fish
ing is the best he ever saw there, and
that the entire party is well and en
joying life immensely. Bryan says that
County Treasurer George MacDonald is
the champion trout fisherman of their
party, catching the largest and most
trout. They will be there another
month.
Trap Shoot.
The Phoenix Gun Club will hold their
regular monthly shoot this morning at
nine o’clock, at their traps at the Fair
Grounds. Three medals are to be shot
for. Any shooter is welcome at these
shoots; bring your gun along.
Tucson Tournament.
The twenty-first annual tournament
of the Arizona Sportsmen’s Association
will be held at Tucson October 23, 24,
25 and 26. $1000 cash will be added to
the purses. With the increased interest
in trap shooting the past year in
Arizona, it is safe to say that teams
from a dozen gun clubs will be on hand
the opening day.

Referee Skidmore’s Statement

When approached by a Repub
lican representative yesterday
William Skidmore, referee of the
Memsic-Daly boxing match at
first refused to allow himself to
be quoted. “I don’t believe in
these statements. I can give no
decision in last night’s bout.”
Questioned about the “foul,”
Skid said: “There were four–
technical fouls. Three were com
mitted by Daly and one by Mem
sic. Of the four Memsic’s show
ed the least policy, and although
he had a right to attempt to put
Daly out as he came up from the
knock down, he should have held
his head better and backed off,
if he was justified in attacking,
the public would not think so.
It looked like breaking the
American rule of fair play,
though after one fighter’s knees
are off the mat, the other can
sail in. Twice Daly worked
low on Memsic in clinches not
intentionally once in the second
and once in the fifth. I heard
Memsic say ‘Look out Pete, you’re
hitting me low and might hurt
me.’ After the knockdown
Daly’s seconds helped him up
through the ropes, which was the
nearest to a real foul of the
whole match.
You may say for me that out
side the knockdown the match
would have been clearly a draw
worth repeating and I still think
it would be a clever thing to
match the two again. It was a
mighty good fight and worth the
money.”

MORE PRIZES

For the second time, The Republi
can’s advertising fans will give cer
tain nifty little premiums for dia
mond excellence today. The second
Sunday, with the home team battling
against the league leading Highland
ers, will find a still more anxious
crowd of players contesting for the
prizes.
There has been no change in the
offers. Just as they were stated last
Sunday, so are they today. By re
ference to the baseball special, the
fans can see just what the line up
will be.
All the prizes, except those for
home runs, three baggers and stolen
home plates were awarded last Sun
day. The fact that there was no
four base hit, none for three bases
nor yet any piratical appropriation
of home plate, left four premiums
unclaimed. They were the bat of
Pinney and Robinson, the credit on a
Dwight B. Heard lot, the Durham Du
plex safety razor from the Busy
Pharmacy and the cigars of Eddie
Doyle.
The prizes offered for today, in
addition to those above named and
still up for the taking, are about as
follows:
Pair of sox for the first two bag
ger from Morales Mercantile Com
pany; real leather belt from New
York store for player making two
runs; Spalding league ball to player
making least errors from Turnbull’s;
fly swatter and rubber balls for man
who fans most, from Valley
Lumber Company; a dollar in mer
chandise to player scoring most hits
from Danny’s; a drink a day at the
soda fountain of the Central Phar
macy to player stealing most bases;
a pitcher to man making most put
outs from Massie’s; a Williams shav
ing stick from the Busy Drug Store
for the man making the first error;
a hat to the man hitting the ball
over the fence from John Ryder; a
dollar safety razor for the man mak
ing the first sacrifice hit from the
Owl Drug Company; six months sub
scription to player whose uniform is
neatest from the manager of The Re
publican; a three hour ride in the
easy riding Franklin of Geo. Hage
man to the man who is easiest on
his shoe leather; four sacks of Bull
Durham from Mary Ann Grocery for
the man making the most runs; a
handsome silk tie from Goldberg Bros.
for the best base stealer; a dollar
deposit in the Phoenix Savings Bank
and Trust Company for the catcher
throwing out the first man at sec
ond; two pairs of trousers cleaned
at McKean’s Dye Works to the play
er who wears the dirtiest uniform
at the end of the game; four bits
worth of cigars from Eddie Doyle for
the man who steals home; merchan
dise at Elwell’s to the man making
the most sensational play, three
shines at Jesse’s for the man making
the first infield hit; a week pass for
two to the Coliseum and Empress
for the man making first base most
times on walks. And in addition,
Bob Turnbull will photograph the
winners.
