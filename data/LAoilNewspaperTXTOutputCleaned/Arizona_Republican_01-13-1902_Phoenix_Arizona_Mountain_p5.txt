ARIZONA WEATHER.
Washington, Jan. 12. Arizona Fair
Monday and Tuesday; variable winds.
KING'S DAUGHTERS. The King's
Daughters of the Baptist church give
a social at the church next Friday
evening, which undoubtedly will be well
attended.
NEW YEAR'S EVE. Yesterday was
another beautiful sunshiny day and the
afternoon was just the sort to make
the band concert enjoyable for those
who love music.
CHURCH MUSIC. The music at the
Baptist church yesterday included a
duet, "Holy Divine," by Mrs. Embree
and Mr. Dodsworth and a solo, "Some
time We'll Understand," by Mr. Dodsworth.
WINTER VISITORS. Mr. and Mrs.
William A. Giles of Chicago arrived
here yesterday morning and are guests
of the Hotel Adams. Mr. Giles spent
last winter in Phoenix in company with
his daughter who did not come this year.
WICKENBURG RUNICH. A
large audience was present at the dedication
services at the new Catholic
church in Wickenburg. Father Severin,
Father John and Sister Marti Peter
were present from Phoenix. The singing
was exceptionally good, being led
by Mrs. Kilroy of Phoenix. The building
is an ornament to the town.
MAY LOCATE. Mr. H. A. Benjamin,
a business man from Mendocino county,
California, is in the city looking
around with the intention of possibly
engaging in some commercial business.
Mr. Benjamin has also been largely interested
in mining in California and
visited Phoenix once about twenty
years ago.
AN EVENING PARTY. A party
was given on Friday night at the residence
of Mr. K. H. Woolf, northeast
of town, in honor of Miss Pearl Sandusky.
Miss Sandusky is a relative
of Mr. Frank Haum and family and
came here from Illinois on a visit.
Pleasing refreshments were served and
music was a conspicuous feature of the
evening's entertainment.
AN INUNDATION. There was another
inundation of the sidewalk at
the corner of Fifth and Washington
streets during the last run of water.
The grade built up by the city
street commissioner has again become
a swamp. There must be a weak spot
in the earth's surface somewhere in
that vicinity, for it settles below the
ditch level about once a year.
CAMELBACK PICNICS. Camelback
mountain is coming in for its
usual share of attention from picnic
parties at this time of year. On
Saturday there were two big parties at
"Frobbers' House," one of the camp
grounds for picnic parties. One party
was composed of fourteen young people
from Phoenix and the other of
twenty-one young people from school
district No. 14.
ROBBERIES AT WICKENBURG
Wickenburg business men suffered
from two robberies during last week.
The first in years. On Monday night
H. Dunn's barber shop was broken
into and several razors and other articles
abstracted, but nothing was
taken except the razors and a few bottles
of toilet water, the other articles
being left on the outside of the shop.
Thursday morning between 7 and 8
o'clock, someone entered Case's saloon
and appropriated some of Case's cash
from behind the bar.
FELL SO FAR. A terrible accident
occurred in Globe a few days ago.
Peter Magnino, a miner, falling so far
down a shaft at the Old Dominion
mine. He was working at night on
top, helping a crew of men making
some repairs and being sent for a lantern
inadvertently stepped into the
shaft in the darkness. His body landed
on some cross-pieces 500 feet below. He
was terribly mangled, one leg being
torn off at the hip-joint and the other
foot being torn off while nearly every
bone in his body was broken.
OLD ACQUAINTANCE RENEWED.
Mr. A. P. Copper of Los Angeles, is
in the city on a business trip. Though
he has visited every town and camp
west of Salt Lake City except in Arizona
and New Mexico, this is his first
trip through this section. Mr. Copper
represents James Hill & Sons of Los
Angeles, manufacturers of olive oil and
dealers in all olive products. His visit
is a pleasant surprise to an employee
of this office, who a great many years
ago and a great many miles from Arizona,
had the pleasure of being licked
by the same schoolmaster.
INDUCEMENT TO NORMAL STUDENTS.
One of the most successful
semesters' work of the territorial normal
school at Tempe will be completed
in January and the second semester
will begin Monday, January 7, and will
continue for five months. Most of the
work of the class will change at the
beginning of the semester and it will
be a very favorable opportunity for new
students to enter the normal and take
up their studies with the classes then
formed. All students who desire to enter
the normal at that time can secure
half rates over all the railroads of the
territory by making application at once
to the principal of the normal.
NEWSPAPER MAN DEAD. On
Wednesday evening, at the county hospital
in Tombstone, Frank W. Orrflin
departed this life. The deceased was
an old newspaper man, and in his
earlier days was associated with the
metropolitan dailies in Chicago and
St. Louis. Through adversity and mis
fortune he drifted to the west, and
(owing to his uncontrollable appetite
for strong drink and physical ailments
he was not able to hold a position for
long, says the Review. At one
time he was local reporter on the Star,
and of late years was connected with
the newspapers in Cochise county. His
last assignment was court reporter for
the Review at the recent term in Cochise
county. He returned to Tombstone
a few weeks ago, and after a protracted
spree was attacked with pneumonia
and was taken to the hospital in Tombstone
and only lived two days.
EPISCOPAL LEAGUE ANNIVERSARY.
The Epworth League of the M.
E. Church, South, celebrated the anniversary
of their league in a very appropriate
manner last night. After the
regular Sunday evening service Scott
Osborne, president of the league, presided
over the meeting. After prayer
the apostles' creed was read in concert
by the league. Songs were rendered
during the meeting. A responsive reading
was given under the department
of worship, after which William Linslay
gave a talk on devotional meetings.
Miss Margaret Asap read a very instructive
paper on the work of the
league and its department. An excellent
missionary paper was read by
Miss Kr.le Hughes. Rev. R. A. Low-
imd briefly reviewed the Epworth
League's work, its purposes and what
it was doing for the church. All cordially
invited to attend these regular
Sunday night meetings.
LEY CALLER. Mr. Frank A. Ley,
editor of the Globe Times, was in Phoenix
Saturday, leaving yesterday morning
for a short visit in Prescott. While
here he visited The Republican office
and exchanged professional courtesies.
He was welcomed, of course, as a poet
and a humorist always is in a newspaper
office, but he hypnotized everybody
on the floor with whom he came
in contact, and the editorial staff
got so busy singing over his rhymes
about the honest miner that hits the
drill, etc., and cogitating on that love
song he wrote, that they forgot to ask
him to write for The Republican.

all about Frank. But Mr. Moy can
like it if he wants to, for he is
in that fix himself. There has never
been but one anti-toxin discovered that
will eradicate the love bacillus without
injury to the human and that is
serum. Mr. Moy likes it. It is surely
effective and surely not bad to take in
reasonable quantity.

Perfect eyes do not always mean perfect
or restful vision. Outwardly
the eye may be perfect inwardly they
may be deformed, causing overexertion
of the delicate nerve and muscle appendages
with consequent headaches, indigestion
and numerous other bodily ills.
"We do not always fit eye glasses and
spectacles to make you see better, but
to make you see easier to rid you of
