GLENDALE CITY

TAX RATE REDUCED
TO $1.01 THIS YEAR
GLENDALE, Aug. 19. The town
council at its last meeting officially
adopted a budget for the ensuing fiscal
year, fixing the amount of money to be
raised by direct property taxation at
$21,733.39, and the tax rate for the
period at $1 per hundred dollars of
property valuation.
This compares with a tax rate of
$1.64 per hundred last year, and the
total amount to be raised by direct
taxation this year is several thousand
dollars lower than for last year. This
was brought about by lopping off the
tentative budget item of $35,000, which
the city expects to raise by the sale
of recently voted bonds, as the council
now expects to be able to place these
bonds during the year.
With a cut of 64 cents in the city
tax rate, and a reduction of 30 cents
in the state and county rate, the tax
rate be much lower this year in Glendale
than last year, although in some
cases increases in assessed valuations
of property will equalize the reduced
rate.

Benefit Society Meets
The Security Benefit Society held a
"family night" meeting last night at
which all families of members were in
vited to be present, with the result that
a large attendance was on hand. In
addition to the social features of the

ice cream and cake were served.

A. M. Hoel and wife have cut their

garet Crawford have accepted positions

FIRST 1920 COTTON
GLENDALE DISTRICT

GLENDALE, Aug. 19. J. B. Ingram,
city councilman and cotton grower, to
day won the distinction of bringing to
town the first load of cotton grown this
season in the Glendale district, when
he hauled to the gin of the Southwest
Cotton Company 3,736 pounds picked
from his 17-acre crop of volunteer cot
ton on his ranch north of Glendale.

Mr. Ingram has 20 pickers at work in
the field and expects to be hauling in
cotton from this field almost daily now
until the crop is cleaned up. While the
cotton was accepted at the gin, no
figure could be secured from them as
the opening price for cotton, although
the local manager stated he thought the
company would be ready to name a
price within the next few days.

Restaurant Fire
An incipient blaze was discovered in
the rear part of the American restau
rant last night, but the flames were
extinguished before much damage was
done. During the excitement attendant
upon the fire, it was also reported that
an attempt was made to rob the pro
prietor of the restaurant by two Mex
icans, who were thwarted by the show
of resistance offered.

Goes to Coast
A. G. Pilcher, local druggist, has gone
to the coast for a brief business and
pleasure trip.

Departs for Los Angeles
C. D. Boyer, formerly in the real es
tate and fruit business here, has dis
posed of his local interests and gone to
Los Angeles, where he will engage in
the produce business.

HIGHWAY DISTRICT

COVER LARGE AREA
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 20. Forest
fires were worse in Montana, Idaho,
and California today, high winds in
places nullifying defensive work of
weeks.
In northern Idaho and western
Montana winds have spread fires be
yond control of the fire fighters, for
est officials announced. The worst
effect has been felt in the Selway,
Kaniksu and St. Joe forests in Idaho
and the Flathead forest in Montana.
The Otter Creek fire in the Selway for
est has covered 4,000 acres.
In California, towns in the old gold
mining district in Stanislaus, Tuol
umne and Calaveras counties, and
even as far distant as Stockton, 73
miles away, have been called upon for
aid in fighting a fire that has burned
more than 10,000 acres of the Stanis
laus forest. This fire is threatening
valuable timber.
Another fire has swept 20,000 acres
in the Lassen forest and a third is
burning uncontrolled in the Klamath
forest. One fire in the Shasta forest
was controlled today.

CANTALOUPES
TUCK DISTRICT
BRING LOW PRICES
GLENDALE, Aug. 19. Information
to the Glendale District Commercial
Club from the Turlock, Calif., canta
loupe district tends to show that the
melon growers of that section are re
ceiving much lower prices for their
product than were commanded by the
Glendale cantaloupes.
Recent advices show that Turlock
growers were receiving but from 65 to
80 cents a standard crate for 45-pack
cantaloupes, whereas none of the Glen
dale melons sold here for less than $1.75
to $2 per crate of 45.
Many local growers, however, pro
fess to believe that the pending freight
rates, which are to undergo a big in
crease at the end of the month, will
have a far-reaching effect upon the
cantaloupe industry in this district. It
is believed that, because of these higher
rates, it may not be profitable to ship
cantaloupes to eastern markets next
season, and, with this opinion holding,
a big cut in cantaloupe acreage next
season may result.

Returns from the cantaloupe pool of
the past season, however, show very
good returns, so far as market condi
tions were concerned, aphids and early
rains causing some losses in the fields,
third settings being abandoned in many
cases without picking.

GARAGES
DESTROYED BY FIRE
WITH $120,000 LOSS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 20. Eighteen
automobiles were damaged and a tire
shop and a garage were destroyed by
a $120,000 fire in the business section
of Tucson yesterday. The auto
mobiles were mostly cars left in stor
age at the garage. The fire originated
from a vulcanizing burner in the tire
shop, fire department officials said.
The building was owned by George
Reed and was damaged about $3,000.
The Gates Half Sole Tire agency dam
ages amounted to about $2,500 and the
Miller Automobile Company about
$5,000. The remainder of the estimated
damage was to the cars. The loss was
only partly covered by insurance.

APPLICATION MADE FOR
FREE DELIVERY
OF MAIL IN GLENDALE

GLENDALE, Aug. 19. Postmaster
Hawks has made application to the
postal department at Washington for
free city mail delivery for Glendale,
and has asked for the assignment of
two carriers to the city to take care of
the volume of business now mostly
handled through the general delivery
window.
This follows action of the Glendale
District Commercial Club in securing
the co-operation of the town council
in the signing of the streets and num
bering of the stores and houses, a
requisite to free mail delivery stipu
lated by the post office department. The
council has secured and erected at all
the principal street intersections neat
metal signs giving the names of the
streets, as fixed in the new survey
of the city, and most of the houses have
now been numbered.
As the volume of business at the
local post office, because of the rapid
upbuilding of the city the past year or
so, has long been sufficiently great to
entitle the town to free delivery of
mail, it was but a question of comply
ing with the post office department re
quirements as to street signs and house
numbers, to secure this free service,
and it is expected that when a post
office inspector arrives here to investi
gate Postmaster Hawks application,
he will promptly endorse the applica
tion.

RESIDENTS TO NAME
FRENCH WILL CLAIM
DAMAGES IN MEXICO
THEIR OIL OFFICER
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 20. Although
Lower California is a territory and not
a state, its people will be permitted to
name their own governor, Eduardo
Ruiz, Mexican consul, announced to
day.
Ordinarily Lower California's gover
nor would be appointed by the central
government, Senor Ruiz declared, but
the provisional authorities had ar
ranged that a special election be held
in the territory early next year.
Senor Ruiz added that either Balde
romero Almada, now living here, or J.
M. Carpio, former consul, probably
would succeed Luis M. Salazar as tem
porary governor, to serve until the
election.
It was reported today from Mexicali
that everything was quiet there, and
that Colonel Esteban Cantu, who sur
rendered the governorship last night to
Luis M. Salazar, probably would leave
very soon.

NEBRASKA SOCIALISTS BUSY
LINCOLN, Neb., Aug. 20. Secretary
of State Nesberry yesterday notified
by Eva Pardee Travis, secretary of the
socialist party of Nebraska, that that
organization will ask for a place on the
Nebraska presidential ballot, presenting
its candidate by petition. The party
lost its right to a place on the ballot by
failing to cast one per cent of the tota
vote of the state at the last general
election. The secretary of state says
he will place the socialist ticket on the
ballot when 500 voters petition it.
