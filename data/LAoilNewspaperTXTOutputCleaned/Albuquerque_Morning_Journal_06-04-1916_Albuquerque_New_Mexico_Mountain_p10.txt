Nobody Home
The ebb tide of local society is now
in full flow. Almost literally by every
train they are leaving town for moun-
tains or seashore seeing America
first, often to their discomfort per-
suading themselves that they are more
comfortable where they are than they
would be at home, but secretly wish-
ing that they were back in good old
Albuquerque where the nights are al-
ways cool and where, even when the
sun shines hottest, there is nothing to
complain of in the shade.
Man is a migratory animal, woman
even more so. The impulse to change
locations with the changing seasons is
almost universal. Perhaps it is better
for the sundry hotel-keepers and mil-
lionaires that it might become a charge
on the community.
The Albuquerque colony or colonies, to be more exact than the California bench resort this summer will be larger than for many seasons past, while the eastern centers are ruling into than their share of attention from our perambulatory population.
A scattered few of us are left to run-
dle with each other and to keep
things going in the heat we keep a
watchful eye on the children and re-
flect with feelings of despair that
the long road has just begun.
Send the rain now and then and

well as he does the humorous "men.
The Lakin-faithful-duet be-
tween Mr. SpHiildlin and Mr. Meyer,
in the throne room of the king, was
a very effective one and well acted

and made really. Mr. Faulken
tmir did and played the role of Mor-
deen, the old Jew, in a convincing
and sympathetic manner, and was
heartily applauded by Mrs. Beatrice

tional interpretation were delightful.
The part of Zerenh, the wife of Ha

iman, was ably held by Mrs. McClan
ahan, and little AIIhh Leonia Pettit made
a winsome Ida, the child of Ha ill an
and Zerenli. Her scene with the old
hi'Kftitr was very sweetly acted.
The ruined, painted heKftar was one
of the most realistic characters in the
play and was splendidly given by Mr.
Frank Arimatrong', whose costume,
make-up and acting were especially
good. Mrs. Hennlin played the dif-
ficult role of the Prophetess in a man-
ner that brought her much praise.
Mrs. Alberta Hawthorne, the fair
haired Median princess, and Mrs. Ma

poise and grace. Mr. Edward Priny
enacted the role of the herald very grace-
fully and Mr. Motherland was and
looked the part of a wine bibber. And
there were other Jews and Persians,
and maids of honor, and dancing girls, and
a hand of boys Sinclair and waving
palm branches. The ensemble work
of the chorus was really good in volume, balance, shading and dramatic action. The luni-
po't scene was one of original beauty and it was
managing to see how many actors
could be assembled on the stage with
out any appearance of crowding. The
low, lace-covered banquet table was
encircled with rushions on which the
royal diners reclined and drank from

silver goblets. Charming little white
clad girls fitted in, bearing garlands
of pink roses with which they eve-
cuted a pleasant dance before offer-

Pegusus rides the open range as
freely as he submits to bit and reins
in editorial sanctums. In the fullness
of time, New Mexico may produce a
Shakespeare or a Cervantes and, in

the meanwhile, in the columns of its

press, English, as well as Spanish, is

the subdued light, into which the pic
tures fall like rays of sunshine through
a prism, giving it a glory that it never
possessed in its most romantic and
thrilling days.
Most distinguished, at least best
known among the five exhibitors, is
Mrs. Laura Knight, by some pro-
nounced the greatest of living woman
painters, whose pictures have been
bought by some of the leading art
galleries of England and Canada, and
have won gold, silver and bronze
medals as well as honorable mention
in exhibits from Australia to South
Kensington, and from Ottawa to Paris.
There is enough variety in the ten pic
tures she exhibits to give some idea
of her powers. "Boys and Hunts at
St. Ives, Cornwall," is perhaps the
most appealing. The pose and poise
of the boys, the children of the sea,
as they lean over the boats, might
be called a study in relaxation, "On

the Cliff" appeals because of its sim
plicity, and yet greatness. A woman,
a summer visitor to the shore, is
seated on the cliff, a child leaning in

her lap, and gazing over the ocean,
which runs from a light, cool, trans-
parent green into misty grays in the
distance. "Spring Flowers" is of the

same style yet different in character.

Three children happily picking daffo-
dils in a sunny meadow on the edge
of a dense, shadowy wood, Who

would not like to gaze upon a scene like
that every day in a lifetime? "Wading

from the Slipway, and men
on the Beach," are also studies of St.

Ives, but more sketchy in character.

Her "balloon dress" he'll deride.

Cornwall is the theme also of the!

is represented by only two pictures,!

these two being of such beauty, that
there is an overwhelming desire to see
more of his work. "Evening, Stuthes,
Yorkshire," is fine. It is a picture

with atmosphere and one returns to
it again and again to study the tech-
nique that accomplished that veris-
similitude of late evening, the rapidly j KTH
falling darkness, the dim reflections w
of the cliff-like houses in a patch of i ":..

water below, and the receding vision of
the boat being hauled up on the sand
above high tide. "Hauling the Fish
ing Cohhlei at Stralthos," is, perhaps,
the most impressionistic picture of the
entire twenty-nine. But impression

ism is not made an excuse for slouch-
iness, or for poor draftsmanship, as it

is so often by American artists. It

is not passing off a daub for a real
picture. The water color reminds
Santa Feans much of the work of the
late Donald Heauregard with which
they have become familiar. The. 'ac-

Hon is good, the composition excellent,

the color pleasing. The New Museum
intends to be very exacting as to the
pictures it will hang in the permanent ,
art gallery, but if some kind friend!
were to give it either one of
these two, it certainly would be given j
a place among the permanent treas-
urcs. I
S. J. I. Birch, an English artist of,
fame, exhibits six landscapes, done i
with such infinite and loving care, j
with such faultless drawing, such re-1
at mini in color, that each must be ;
called a gem. The skies are wonder- i
full. The pictures stand out like etch-'

ings, are as clear cut as cameos, and
one cannot but help forming a mental '
Image of a painter who unites genius'
with such exquisite craftsmanship. It!
is difficult to choose among the six. i
there is one for every temperament, i
"Molton Abbey" is perhaps the great-'
est; "The Estuary" perhaps the most
restful and satisfying, for the eye nf-
tor wandering to the far, picturesque
hills whence comes the river, returns'
again and again to the white farm-i

house in the foreground, nestled at the
foot of a bluff, which seems to pro
claim the salt air that is wafted from
the ocean not far away. But then
there is "Frosty Evening, on the Ulver
I'lym Near Plymouth," as dainty a bit
of drawing and painting as has been
ever exhibited at Santa Fe, unless it
was by K. M. Chapman, of the Mu
seum staff, of whose careful and fine
draftsmanship these water colors are
a strong reminder. "The Edge of an
Inland Sea." has a wonderful sky with
the pink tint of rose petals. There are
two French landscapes among the

Hindi pictures, both of them scenes
not far from where the heaviest fight
ing has been in progress, one shows
the river course near Alontreuil-siur-

Alar. and the other the Gateway of
Chateau d. Argues near Dieppe,
The six landscapes by K. Hughes
give the England as the traveler
knows it, with gray skies, with rest
ful meadows and villages, with almoH
stere washed by frequent rains and
fogs. A pang of homesickness is
guaranteed the native of Yorkshire of

Wales who will come to look at
canvasses, superb in their composi

tion and coloring. "On the River"
and "The River at Walberswick"
seem to have the tang of the salt air
