A Bankrupt Territory.
A short time ago, in discussing the
joint-statehood question with former
Governor Murphy, the Hon. Joseph G.
Cannon of Illinois, speaker of the na
tional house of representatives, alluded
to Arizona as a "bankrupt territory." Incidentally we might inquire
why the speaker is so determined to
inflict upon the prosperous common
wealth of New Mexico a consolidation
with a bankrupt territory, but let that
pass. Let us see about the bankrupt
business.
Yesterday was the first day of the
new fiscal year. Territorial Treasurer
Kirkland, upon casting up his ac
counts, found that he had on hand, in
cash, Two Hundred and Seventy-two
Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy-
six dollars and fourteen cents, rather
a comfortable balance for a bankrupt
institution! This is more money than
the treasury ever before contained at
the beginning of a fiscal year.
The territory is on a strictly cash
basis. All valid claims are paid
promptly in cash, and there is always
a good bunch of money on hand for
a rainy day. Bonded indebtedness to
the amount of ten thousand dollars
was paid off yesterday. And while
maintaining this excellent status the
territorial administration is not in
creasing the tax levy.
But, of course, the solvency of an
institution, mercantile or governmental,
is not determined alone by its cash
on hand. It is necessary to consider
assets and liabilities. Where does Ari
zona stand in that particular?
In round figures, the bonded debt of
the territory is one million dollars. In
clude with that the total indebtedness
of the counties and towns, and
the public debt approximates
three million dollars. To offset
these obligations the assessed val
uation of the property in the
territory this year will exceed
Forty-five millions. As everybody
knows, this assessed valuation by no
means correctly represents the prop
erty wealth of the territory. There
is more than one mine that could not
be purchased for forty-five millions.
If assessments were upon an equitable
basis the property assessed for taxa
tion would be valued at seventy-five
millions, at least.
But taking the situation as we find
it, the figures are bound to confound
Uncle Joe Cannon when he studies
them. "I know all about Arizona,"
he said in the interview to which we
have referred, but he will know some
what more when he has learned the
facts about this territory's financial
condition.
Any commercial institution would
consider itself as in first-class shape
if it owed but three millions and had
forty-five millions in taxable property,
and a working cash balance of two
hundred and seventy-two thousand
dollars.
The fact is, no subdivision of the
union is in a more flourishing condi
tion than is Arizona today, and no sec
tion of our great country has a bright
er future.
Politicians in the United States con
gress may shut their eyes to the facts,
but they cannot mislead the country
by wild assertions that Arizona is
bankrupt. The shrewdest, most care
fully calculating people in the world
on financial matters are the bond
buyers. If Uncle Joe Cannon wishes
to know what they think of Arizona,
let him try to get some Arizona bonds —
five per cent bonds at that — from
the bargain counters of the bond deal
ers. He will find it necessary to pungle
up one dollar and ten cents for
every dollar of Arizona's obligations
that he buys! And the sellers will tell
him that he has obtained a security
that is as sound as anything issued
by Uncle Sam.
One of Europe's Dreams.
Prince Louis of Battenberg, nephew
of the king of England, is to visit this
country in October. He will come in
command of a squadron of five Brit
ish cruisers: the Drake, the Cornwall,
the Cumberland, the Essex and the
Bedford. It is probable that the bat
tleship fleet of the United States navy,
with Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans,
commander-in-chief of the North At
lantic squadron, will be at New York
to receive the distinguished visitor.
Then, probably, the statesmen of
Europe will see in their mind's eye a
joint naval demonstration by Great
Britain and the United States in New
York harbor, and great will be the
speculation as to the motive therefor
and the significance thereof. Of course
the meeting of the two fleets will be
in no sense a joint naval demonstra
tion. But it will answer the purpose
of one in giving the chancellories of
Europe matter for thought and in
strengthening the existing impression
that there is an agreement between
the two great English-speaking naval
nations that if ever their respective
navies are engaged in the same war
they will be found fighting shoulder
to shoulder on the same side. Over
in Europe they believe as firmly in
the existence of an Anglo-American
treaty as in any actual fact of di
plomacy. Americans know that any such
secret treaty is impossible. But the im
possibility of convincing European
governments of this truth is by no
means to be deplored. It tends to keep
them in order and to preserve the
peace of the world. No European
naval power, nor alliance of European
naval powers, would think seriously
for a moment of engaging in a naval
war against England and America
combined, and the belief that attack
ing one will mean attacking both
makes exceedingly unlikely an attack
on either. Meanwhile the "Anglo-
American entente," which is really no
more than a practical recognition by
the two nations that neither has any
thing to fear from the other, since
their interests are such that they are
a good deal more likely to accord than
to clash, actually binds neither nation
to anything whatever. It is a great
arrangement for this country and for
Great Britain — this "Anglo-American
entente" that the imagination of Eu
rope has evolved for them. It has all
the advantages without any of the dis
advantages of an "entangling alliance."
Drawing the Sex Line.
There comes from Los Angeles a
story of a most unreasonable perform
ance by the women's clubs of that
beautiful city, which suggests a possi
bility that, if this sort of thing spreads,
the "sex line" may come to be as much
of a nuisance in this country as the
various other lines are now.
Los Angeles has a free public libra
ry. A certain Miss Jones has been its
librarian for several years. The evi
dence at hand does not indicate that
Miss Jones was an especially efficient
librarian. The trustees of the library
have been bombarded with complaints
against her for some time past. Hav
ing convinced themselves of the jus
tice of these complaints, the trustees
gave Miss Jones an opportunity to re
sign quietly and apparently of her own
free will. Miss Jones rejected the op
portunity. She clung to her post like
the limpet to the rock. Finally the
board of trustees felt itself compelled
to discharge her and appointed in her
place Charles A. Lummis, editor of
Out West.
Then the women's clubs rose in their
might to protest. They have been
holding indignation meetings and
adopting resolutions calling upon the
mayor to remove all the library trus
tees and to appoint in their places men
who "will see to it that the librarian is
a woman."
It will be noted that the women's
clubs of Los Angeles raise no question
as to the propriety of the removal of
Miss Jones. The dire injustice that
racks their souls is the appointment of
a man to succeed her. They probably
think they know of some reason why
the public interest requires that the
office of public librarian should be held
by a woman and not by a man, but
they don't mention it in their protest.
Their idea seems to be that as they
are organizations of women they are
bound to insist that a woman shall not
be superseded in office by a man, un
der any circumstances whatever. In
short they draw the sex line.
It is to be hoped that unless the wo
men's clubs can show some sort of
reason why the public librarian of Los
Angeles should be a woman rather
than a man, the mayor of Los Angeles
will pay no attention to their silly res
olutions. Drawing the sex line is a
practice not to be encouraged. The
country has troubles enough without
adding any such nonsense as the ideas
of the women's clubs of Los Angeles
to its handicaps.
Charles L. Davidson, who was born
in Japan and has just married a Cin
cinnati girl, tells an "Army and Navy
Journal" correspondent that "March
ing Through Georgia" is the favorite
band tune of the Japanese soldiers.
"The brass bands play it so much," he
says, "that the men have learned to
understand the intervals, the harmony
and the rhythm. There is no such thing
as 'time' in the native Japanese mu
sic. Since the war came, however, Jap
anese composers have written a num
ber of patriotic airs, in which the
characteristics of the native music
have been blended with some of ours,
notably the rhythmic swing of our
march pieces. These airs have been
put to patriotic songs and the men
sing them with great delight, picking
up the new tunes readily, and shout
ing them at the top of their voices."

(Concerning the Versatility of Pres
ident Roosevelt as a Sportsman.)
My paw he sez 'at President Roosevelt is th' most versatile sportin'
character of the age. He's equally at
home among the lairs of ah' grizzly
bears an' other wild beasts in th'
Rocky Mountains an' th' hunts of th'
wild an' untamed Harvard students.
He jist ain't afeard of nothin'. Wun
day he'll be a chasin' coyotes around
in Texas after their wolf pelts an'
the next day he'll be rushin' around
th' New England colleges liftin'
sheepskins promiscuous.
He's got his privit room in th' White
House decorated in what my paw
calls his most variegated manner. In
place of carpets th' floor is covered
with skins of bears, wolves an' mount
ain lions which was conferred on
th' President on his Colorado trip last
spring. Instid of wallpaper th' Presi
dent has th' walls an' ceilin' pasted
over with th' diplomas an' degrees
which he's captured on his various
outin's among th' wiles of th' New
England colleges.
Th' President he sez last week:
"Sometimes I thinks 'at I'd ruther hunt
wild beast skins 'n to be achasin'
around after th' innofensive sheepskin.
Both forms of sport has their draw
backs. Wun nice thing about a sheep
skin huntin' expedition is 'at you al
ways know where you're agoin' to
find your prey. But you can't never
tell where to look fer a bear. I don't
make no appointments an' if he
did th' chances is 'at he wouldn't keep
'em. But there's been wun exception
to this rule in my experience an' that
was down in Mississippi wunst. Some
of my thoughtful frends of mine cot a
bear an' chained him to a tree an' th'
next mornin' they escorted me to his
lair. I declined that bear's skin. It
looked too much like acceptin' an or
nery degree from a fourth class col
lege. But on th' other hand bear huntin'
has wun advantidge over th' college
chase. When you git tired you can
stop an' rest but in th' pursuit of th'
diploma an' th' degree there ain't no
breathin' spell fer a whole Commence
ment week. I b'leeve I'd ruther hunt
in Colorado 'n in Cambridge. Well,
I'm glad it's over agin till next year.
I'm agoin' down to Oyster Bay fer a
rest an' when I git my fill of oysters
I'll take up this here peace bizness
of Rushy an' Japan, an' th' Panama
canal an' Railroad Rate Legislation
an' some other things 'at I been neg
lectin' at don't come under the head of
sports."
