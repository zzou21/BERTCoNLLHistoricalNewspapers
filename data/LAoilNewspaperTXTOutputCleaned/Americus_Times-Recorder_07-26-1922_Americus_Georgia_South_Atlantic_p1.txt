’ h The U first holdup took place at
the electric plant of the Americus
lighting company between 7:30 and
8:00 o’clock. Capt. J. W. Troy,
night engineer, who is web beyond
7U years of age, was sitting at his
desk on the second floor making out
reports when someone walked up
behind him and grasped him rather
lightly about the throat. He was
expecting his assistant about that
time, and thought the assistant had
arrived and was playing with him.
When the grasp tightened he at
tempted to throw the stranger down.
At this juncture a second stranger
appeared in front of him with a
piece of wood and struck him over
the head, inflicting a skin abrasion
and rendering him unconscious for
ten minutes. When he recovered
between $8 and $12 in money, his
watch and spectacles were missing.
He notified his employer and offi
cers and came up town. Two or
three suspects were rounded up and
brought before him he declared each
of them was not the man. He re
sumed his duties about 10 o’clock.
The second holdup occurred later
in the evening at the new Burgin
iplaning mill three miles west of
Americus on the Plains road. Two
men, said to have been negroes,
were reported to have appeared and
asked Mr. Perry, the night watch
man, for a drink. He told them to
help themselves, pointing to the
water when one of them grabbed
him. They held him and took his
money, which happened to be only
$1.20. At this juncture the light of
a turning automobile flashed upon
them and they fled, leaving him un
hurt.
Mr. Perry, who is said to be near
80 years of age, recently moved
to Americus and resides on Forrest

PLANE WRECKED
NEAR ELLAVILLE
IN LONG FLIGHT
Attempted One-Day Jump, Pen
sacola To Washington, Ends
In Failure
An attempted one-day flight of
two DeHaviland airplanes from the
United States naval station at Pen
sacola, Fla., to Washington, D. C.,
by way of Souther Field, was inter
rupted near Ellaville at 9 o’clock
Wednesday morning when one of the
planes developed rudder trouble and
was forced to land. In the landing
the plane somersaulted and was bad
ly wrecked. The pilot, Lieut. Lee,
was unhurt, except somewhat shaken
up.
Both planes were under command
of Lieut. H. A. Elliott, who was pilot
ing the second airship. He saw the
trouble of his companion and also
landed, some distance away, but
safely. On account of the softness
of the field, however, he was unable
to take the air again from that point
and called upon Souther Field for
trucks to convey both planes to the
field.
On account of Souther Field be
ing inactive, however, trucks were
not available, and instead men and
repair parts were sent to the scene
of the wreck to put the damaged
plane in shape to continue the flight.
The wrecked plane landed on the
farm of A. C. Murray, on the edge
of Ellaville, and the other on the
Willie Burt place, about 2 1/2 miles
distant. The propeller, rudder and
wings of Lieut. Lee’s plane were
smashed.
The flight was to have been start
ed Tuesday, but was delayed until
Wednesday morning, the men get
ting off early. They had planned a
brief stop at Souther Field for re
plenishment of gas and oil and cool
ing of the motors. Souther Field of
ficers, however, said they had no no
tice of their coming until the call
for assistance came.

CUFF WALKER
IS VISITOR HERE
Gubernatorial Candidate Guest
Of Rotary Club—Jury Slackers
Scored By Dykes
Clifford Walker, of Monroe, candi
date for governor in opposition to
Thos. W. Hardwick, the present gov
ernor, was an Americus visitor Wed
nesday and was a guest of the Rotary
club at its regular weekly luncheon
as the guest of his brother-in-law,
Frank P. Harrold. Mr. Walker made
a few remarks when introduced but
refrained from mentioning politics.
He said he had recently spent a week
on the gulf and had discovered that
the section from here to that point
had learned to grow cotton despite
the boll weevil, disproving the belief
now existing about his own home
community that this cannot be done.
W. W. Dykes gave jury slackers a
scoring in a talk to the club on the
application of the principles of Ro
tary to every day life. He declared
it is the duty of good citizens, along
with the privileges they enjoy under
the law, to do jury duty when called
upon.
President Carr Glover, replying to
Mr. Dykes, blamed the lawyers them
selves largely for conditions of
which he complained, citing the fact
that not long ago he was called for
jury duty in the City court and Serv
ed three days without being permitted
to sit out a single case.

to get rid of Captain Garnett W.

the post of chief of county police in
Brooks county. According to the al
