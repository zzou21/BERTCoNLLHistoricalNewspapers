A

Scene from the Good Book. For the  
first time he realized the life he had  
been leading for years wasn’t the

only thing worth while in the world.

And even Wolf, strange to say, was  
falling in love.  
Between the two the bad man’s  
reformation was accomplished. Then,  
when the supreme moment came,  
Wolf was ready.  
Here, briefly sketched, is the basis  
of "According to St. John," a three-  
part Selig drama, filled with sus-  
pense. Jack Richardson, famous  
heavy, appears as Ben.  
The story follows: Ben Wolf, out-  
law, lives the life of a recluse far up  
in the mountains. Bess, the only  
child of the pastor of the town’s only  
church, is engaged to Dick. Bob, her  
brother, has fallen in with the town’s  
rougher element. Bob loses every-  
thing in a gambling resort. He em-  
bezzles the funds of the church  
and loses all to others. Wolf attends  
church services and is attracted to  
Bess, singing in the choir.  
Bob restores the church fund he  
had stolen. Just before the stage  
coach arrives after reporting a hold-  
up by a masked bandit. A cuff-  
button dropped by the outlaw is the  
only clew. Wolf, in the woods, sees  
Bob hiding a mail pouch under a  
rock. Bess, riding one day with Dick,  
drops her handkerchief. They learn  
that "Wild-Eyed" Bill and his gang  
are on the rampage. Dick sends Bess  
home and starts after the raiders.

Bob’s horse falls, throwing him.  
Wolf assists her to remount. Imme-  
diately his inner self undergoes a  
complete change. He is lured to the  
church and hears Bess sing again.  
Opening the testament he comes upon  
the chapter noted above.

From his mountain shack he loves  
and worships Bess. In the town he  
comes upon the reward offered for  
the unknown outlaw. From the com-  
parison of the cuff button with one  
worn by Bob, Dick learns the truth.  
But his love for Bess forbids him  
making the arrest. Wolf goes to his  
cabin and writes an anonymous letter  
to Dick, telling him that Wolf is the  
outlaw wanted.

Scene from "The Mysteries of Myra"  
at the Plaza Wednesday

THE INNOCENT LIE

At the Arizona Friday and Saturday

Sunday will see "The Mysteries of Myra"  
with another fine picture story of this  
spirit motion picture, and more thrills  
than have heretofore been shown in  
this serial.  
Thursday Pearl White comes to life  
again with a corker in "The Iron  
Claw," full of that peculiar attractive-  
ness that makes this girl the  
most popular one in the movies.  
On Thursday and Friday also there  
will be shown good Mutual programs.  
Thursday has a feature, "Avenged by  
Love," a Horster feature with beau-  
tiful Margaret Gibson. Saturday  
"Craft" will again rear its awful  
front. The end is coming on in this  
serial and it gets more thrilling.

Anna Little, the famous daredevil  
girl, and Tom Chatterton, the hero  
of "The Secret of the Submarine,"  
appear in this picture, which will be  
a great feature at the Plaza Monday.

ARIZONA

The week promises many good  
things at the Arizona. Movie lovers  
will have an opportunity to see many  
of their favorites. Each photodrama  
will present one of the famous ones.  
Here they are: Bessie Barriscale,  
Norma Talmadge, Dustin Farnum and  
Valentine Grant.  
The first picture of the week will  
be a Triangle-Ince feature, "The Sor-  
rows of Love," with Bessie Barriscale  
and William Desmond, who play the  
chief roles in this production. "The  
Sorrows of Love" is of Italian locale,  
and Miss Barriscale has the part of  
Sister Beatrice, who is first seen as  
the Lady in the convent of St. Ce-  
celia. The plot concerns mainly her  
adventures in the outer world, after  
she has fled from the convent, be-  
lieving she can find a greater mission  
outside its walls. How she meets and  
falls in love with a young labor agi-  
tator, only to meet tragedy and re-  
turn again to the convent, has been  
strikingly depicted. In the role as  
Beatrice, Miss Barriscale is credited  
with a remarkable characterization.  
On Tuesday, the dainty little star  
will appear in a stirring drama of  
life. Norma Talmadge, the popular  
Triangle star, has won her way into  
the hearts of movie fans. She appears  
in a wonderful story, "Going Straight,"  
which is claimed by critics to be one  
of the best stories ever turned in the  
Triangle studios.

And still another big one will be  
shown on Wednesday and Thursday.  
This one will be a Pallas picture on  
the Paramount program. They offer  
the esteemed actor, Dustin Farnum, in  
"David Garrick." The play itself is  
logically and strongly portrayed in a  
very pleasing manner, the plot be-  
ing the love of this great man for a  
beautiful London heiress.  
The last two days of the week  
bring the beautiful Paramount star,  
Valentine Grant, in a stirring phot-  
odrama of adventure, "The Innocent  
Lie." The exquisite exterior scenes  
in this production were picturized on  
the island of Bermuda, where Miss  
Grant and a well-selected cast had  
gone expressly for this production.  
This adds to scenic beauty of this  
unusual Paramount production.

AMUZU

Today's picture feature at the  
Amuzu is said by those who follow  
closely the fortunes of the movie  
stars to have been the best outdoor  
picture ever done on the Metro pro-  
gram. It is called "The Yellow  
Streak" and brings Lionel Barrymore,  
brother of the gifted Ethel and the  
equally talented John, to the screen  
in a part that has perhaps done more  
than anything to establish this young-  
er member of the great dramatic fam-  
ily.  
"The Yellow Streak" is a story of  
the primitive. A tale of the times  
that have gone from this western  
country to return no more, and there  
is a fascination in this splendid story  
that will have endeared it to those  
who go in for the faster and more  
strenuous of the photoplay products.  
"The Yellow Streak" as its name im-  
plies, deals with a fellow who is  
thought to have a "yellow streak." An  
offense that no westerner of the days  
of yesterday could condone or pardon.  
The fellow with the yellow streak  
was no better than the unclaimed dog  
of the street. In this virile story  
Lionel Barrymore finds chance to  
bring out all the inherent talents that  
made famous his mother, Georgie  
Drew Barrymore, Maurice Barrymore  
the father, Mrs. John Drew, and in  
fact all of the long list of stage stars  
that have sprung from this celebrated  
strain.  
"The Yellow Streak" is on at the  
Amuzu today only.

RIVERSIDE

The week just past has been a  
banner one at Riverside Park. Each  
day has seen an increasing number  
of bathers in the pool, and their ex-  
pressions of pleasure and enjoyment  
prove that our citizens relish the op-  
portunity to take a dip in the "Phoenix  
Ocean." The many improvements  
for safety and amusement have also  
been the source of much favorable  
comment. The new spring boards  
and floats are greatly enjoyed by the  
hardier swimmers, while the big life  
line gives a feeling of confidence to  
the ladies and children.  

This afternoon there will be a ser-  
ies of aquatic athletic events which  
will be interesting and exciting to  
witness. A relay race will be run by  
teams from Phoenix and Tempe, and  
rivalry between the opponents is  
keen, thus assuring a snappy con-  
test. Pinney and Copstead will do  
a number of their diving stunts end-  
ing with the hair-raising "double dip"  
which they have recently perfected.  
Besides this there will be a diving  
contest which promises to hold the  
attention of the crowd. Mr. C. B.  
Gregory, the famous San Francisco  
swimmer, will present her pupil be-  
fore the crowd this afternoon, and he  
will give a free swimming lesson in  
order to demonstrate to everyone  
how easy it is to learn the essentials  
of swimming.  

During the coming week a greatly  
increased attendance is expected, as  
the public can be assured that there  
will be at least five feet of water in  
the pool on each Monday evening  
hereafter, due to the greatly increased  
flow of water developed in the past  
week. Monday afternoon will be es-  
pecially popular with those ladies and  
children who prefer the shallow water.  
Friday afternoon will be Mothers’  
Day, when all mothers accompanied  
by a child or children will be ad-  
mitted free. The dancing on Tues-  
day, Thursday and Saturday eve-  
nings is proving very popular, and the  
free motion pictures attract good  
crowds. Sunday night is feature night  
at the "open air movies" and an ex-  
tra good program is assured those  
who attend.  

The management of Riverside feels  
very grateful for the liberal patron-  
age extended by the people of Phoe-  
nix and hope that the good feeling  
created will last throughout the en-  
tire season. They also report the  
largest week’s business of the season.

CASA GRANDE

Messrs. J. O. Lacy, J. Wallace and  
Ralph LaVorgne, all of Los Angeles,  
were in Casa Grande and the mining  
district south, looking into some  
mining property.

The Singer-King company re-  
ceived a churn drill which they ex-  
pect to use in prospecting on the  
Singer-King property near Quijotoa.  

Joe McFate and daughters, from  
Phoenix, are spending several days  
with friends in town. This family  
formerly lived here and find a wel-  
come on their occasional visits.

Mrs. A. Elliott, Sr., and Miss Mary  
Elliott are visiting relatives here,  
coming over from Hayden Wednesday.

R. E. Fishburne has returned to  
work in the Casa Grande Valley.
