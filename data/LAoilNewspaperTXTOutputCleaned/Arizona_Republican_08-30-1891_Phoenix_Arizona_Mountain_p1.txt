REVOLUTION.

The Consul for the Chilean
Legation
States the Causes of the
Recent Disruption.
He Says That Congress Violated
the Constitution and Ruined
the Navy.
Associated Press Dispatches.)
New York, Aug. 29. W. M. Ivins,
Consul for the Chilean Legation, today
made a lengthy statement as to the
causes leading up to the Chilean
revolution.
"Balmaceda," he said, "was elected
five years ago by the Liberal party, and
he has had eight or nine distinct cabinets
in his endeavor to please the party
and insure harmony among the factions.
It was impossible, however, to satisfy
the different wings. There were a num-
ber of men determined to rule or ruin Balmaceda!
He is an uncompromising, broad-
minded man of great forbearance, and
he acquiesced in the demands of the
Liberal leaders as long as possible. When
it became evident that to further sub-
mit to Congress would be virtually to abrogate his
office, and serious trouble began. Congress
refused to pass appropriate bills
and charged that the President had a
candidate to succeed him whom he was
trying to force from the country. To
settle this difficulty Balmaceda appointed
the gentleman in question to a cabinet
office, thus removing him from the
list of candidates. Then, notwithstanding
Congress had no power of impeachment,
a majority passed a resolution
declaring the President's office vacant,
because of his failure to submit to Congressional
dictation.
Then on January 7th came an open
rebellion. The opposition majority in
Congress declared themselves the Government,
went on board a man-of-war
with mutinous naval officers and scoured
the coast for a place to land. With
the navy in a state of mutiny it became
imperatively necessary to maintain internal
order at any price.
The majority in Congress having dis-
rupted the Government the President
was left without one of the constitutional
branches of the civil government. Since
those members of Congress had themselves
violated the constitution, debauched the
navy and abandoned their posts, it did
not follow that the President should abandon
his. The obligation on him was greater
to remain and protect the internal order
and external safety of the state.
Washington, Aug. 29. It is not
believed that Balmaceda has been completely
defeated. Most of the military
supplies of Balmaceda's forces entered
the country through Valparaiso, and
Balmaceda's small navy has lost its only
fortified port which may have a depressing
effect upon the fortunes of his party.
As long as Balmaceda remains in possession
of Santiago, the capital of Chile,
and until the Congressional party shall
have set up a de facto government, the
Department of State cannot have relations
with the Congressional party, and
must continue to recognize Balmaceda
as president.
A later cablegram was received from
Errazuriz regarding yesterday's battle,
saying Balmaceda's troops numbered
12,000 men. Three thousand prisoners
and all his artillery was taken. Tor-
pedo boats and all others are in the
power of the Congressionalists. Val-
paraiso was occupied without resistance.
Balmaceda's lieutenants sought
safety on foreign vessels. The Congressionalists'
losses are considerable.
At a late hour tonight the Congressional
envoys in this city received a dispatch
from Errazuriz stating that in the first
day's fighting the enemy lost 1,500
men, and an equal number of prisoners
were captured. Two thousand rifles
were taken and a number of field pieces.
The Congressional loss was 600, and
among the killed were five officers. In
the battle of Placilla yesterday the
defeat of Balmaceda was complete. His
generals, Barbosa and Alcarraz were
killed and many other officers. The
whereabouts of Balmaceda is unknown.
Senor Lazcano, the Chilean Minister, denied
himself to all newspaper reporters
today. It is not believed, however, he
received any dispatches from Chile.
Chicago, Aug. 21. Lieutenant Com-
mander Todd, an executive officer of
the United States cruiser Charleston,
who was in the city today, received
news of Balmaceda's defeat with some
incredulity. He said he found it hard
to believe that Balmaceda was over-
thrown. He knew that when the
Charleston was in Chilean waters Bal-
maceda's forces outnumbered those of
the Congressional party two to one.
Then, too, the talk of the strength of
the insurgent's navy is largely exaggerated.
At the same time Todd cautioned
the people in Chile could be readily bought,
and no change in the relative strength
of the armies need cause great distress.
MILWAUKEE LETTERS (CONTINUED.)
They Will Build Their Married Employ-
ees New Homes at Bakersfield.
San Francisco, Aug. 20. The Southern
Pacific Company offered to give
each of its married employees in the
Tulare shops two lots in Bakersfield on
which to erect houses after the removal
of the railroad shops to that town.
This is done because of the fact that
the removal will entail a loss to many
mechanics who have been paying for
their homes on the installment plan, or
who own them and cannot sell to ad-
vantage. Some of the smaller dwellings will be
removed to Bakersfield.
A HORRIBLE SCENE.
Three Women and Six Infants Found in
the Ruins of Starvation.
Montreal, Aug. 29. Dr. O'Connor
was called into a house kept by Mrs.
Galloway last night to attend a dying
baby. He found three women in a destitute
condition. On the bed were six
infants, one of them dead, while four
others were dying. The women were
all unemployed servants who had been
betrayed and went to the house for
refuge. The woman of the house, who
was supposed to look after them, skipped
out and left the infants in a destitute
condition. All were at the point of
starvation. The infants, with one exception,
will die.

ACCORDING TO A TELEGRAM.
Mugger Instantly Killed in Los-
ing His Grip.
Detroit, Aug. 29. Prof. Hogan, the
balloonist, at the exposition grounds,
fell from a balloon and was instantly
killed this afternoon. He had ascended
nearly a mile and was preparing to cut
loose from the parachute and descend
when he lost his hold and fell to the
ground. The body was mangled beyond
recognition, every bone being broken.
Thirty thousand people witnessed the
catastrophe. Hogan was a brother of
the Hogan who made an ascension in
Campbell's airship in New York some
years ago and was lost.
A Priest Robbed.
Cincinnati, Aug. 29. Early this evening
a man rang the bell at the residence
occupied by Father O'Kottrick, a Catholic
priest. When the priest answered
the ring the man put a revolver close to
him, and in a businesslike tone said:
"Give me all your money." The priest
opened his pocketbook and said:
"Take it out yourself." The robber
took $58, all the priest had, and left no
clue to his identity.
Dakota Prairie Fire.
St. Paul, Aug. 29. An Aberdeen, S.
D., special to the Pioneer Press says:

town. Large quantities of grain and hay
were destroyed. So far no loss of life is
reported. Not less than twenty town-
ships have been desolated by this terrible
fire.
Itch of Water.
Los Angeles, Aug. 29. A special

OUR BERLIN LETTER.
Agricultural Officials to
Report Upon
The Probable Condition of
Rye and Wheat.

The Downfall of Balmaceda Received
With Satisfaction Throughout
Germany.
Copyright 1891 by New York Associated Press.
Berlin, Aug. 29. Orders have been
issued by the Government calling upon
agricultural district officials to report as
to the condition and probable yield of
wheat, and rye. Judging from the
altered tone of the members of the official
circle, a suspension of the import
duties on grain is becoming a recognized
necessity. The Ministers will not wait
until November to submit the question
in the Reichstag, but immediately upon
the conclusion of the gathering and digesting
the statistics will declare the
duties suspended.
The North German Gazette published
an article on the subject in which it
avowed that the main reason for the
Government in hitherto refusing to
lessen or suspend the duties was the
fear that the Reichstag, when once they
were abolished or reduced, never allow
them to be restored. This statement
raised storms of protests in which a
number of journals joined. The notion
that a suspension of duties meant a
permanent abolition is denounced as
absurd, in view of the fact that the
Reichstag, which has got three years to
live, has a clear protection in the theory
ready to remind the duties when the
Government desires. In the meantime
what measures are possible will be
taken to lighten the hardships, resulting
from the dearness of rye. The
Reichsbank has been authorized to
make an advance up to two-thirds the
value of grain placed in the depot. Im-
porters made every exertion to supply
the depots until yesterday, when the
Russian prohibition came into force.
and frontiers did a great carrying on of
trade. The mixture of rye with wheat
has already been largely resorted to and
nothing but this mixture is now used to
make bread for the army. ...
The Reichstag draws attention
to oppose the main clauses of the government's
bill for the repression of
drunkenness. The ultimate fate of the
measure may be predicted, as it is modeled
after a bill of a similar import
which was introduced in the Reichstag
in 1881 and dropped in the committee.
Loading ministerialists are the only
support of the present bill, and their
support is due simply to the fact that
the Emperor, who is the father of the
bill, is in earnest in his efforts to suppress
the growing evils of intemper-
ance.
Handy, Peck and Butler, three members
of the foreign commission of the
Chicago Columbian exposition, who had
been visiting Russia, describe their reception
by M. de Giers, the Russian
prime minister, as a most cordial nature.
Vishnegradsky, the Minister of
Finance, promised he would at an early
date appoint an imperial commission to
attend to all matters pertaining to the
proper representation of Russian art, industry
and manufactures.
The eleven days' tour of Messrs. Brown-
son and Lindsay in Switzerland covered
every industrial center. Every-
where they were told they could rely
upon ample representation of Swiss
products.
Percy Tilghman, who at one time was
the United States Consul at this city,
but who subsequently became notorious
for his swindling operations, has been
at his old tricks again, having swindled
Banker Landry at Hague out of $7,200.
The fall of President Balmaceda of
Chile is received with general satisfaction
here. The position of the new
Balmacedan warship Presidente Pinto,
which is now at Kiel, is a matter of discussion
among naval officers, owing to
different circumstances which now attach
to her. Her commander expects
to remain at Kiel until he can obtain
orders from the constituted government
at Santiago de Chile.
A SERIOUS ACCIDENT
Which May Result In the Death of a
Young Man.
Bob Leo, while working with cattle
on Tobin's ranch, three miles southeast
of Tempe, yesterday, met with an accident
which will probably cost him his
life. He was riding at full speed in pursuit
of a steer when his horse stumbled
in crossing a border and fell heavily,
throwing him with great force upon his
head and shoulder. He was immediately
brought to the Tempe Hotel and
Dr. Hart summoned, who did everything
possible to relieve his sufferings.
He is badly hurt about the head and
shoulders, and it is feared he has sustained
serious internal injuries. He is
conscious most of the time but is unable
to speak. He has a father and sisters
living in Texas. John Kinney, of this
city, who seems to be the only one who
knows of his people, went up on the
stage last night to visit him.
Arab Rebellion.
Aden, Aug. 20. An Arab arrived
here says that Ahmed Ritsedi, the
Pasha Turkish commander, in Yemen,
Arabia, crushed out the revolt in that
province and entered the capital city,
having in train fourteen camels laden
with heads cut from the rebels.
After Years of Separation.
Deputy School Superintendent Robinson
yesterday received a letter dated
at Walker, A. T., from his uncle, Jesse
A. Robinson, whom he had not heard
from since 1860. Mr. Robinson is
well known throughout the Territory,
having extensive mining properties at
Walker, Tip Top and in the vicinity of
Prescott. He left his relatives in North
Carolina about the close of the war and
went to California, but soon after settled
in Arizona. Since then all trace of
him was lost until quite recently when
his nephew accidentally learned that
he was in Arizona, which led to a correspondence
between the two men.

The Great Futurity
Yesterday.
Ran
Killing
on the
Tracks.
Different
On the Diamond Standing of the
Different Leagues Contest
of Oarsmen.
Associated Press Dispatches.
New York, Aug. 29. The great
Futurity race was run this afternoon on
the track of the Coney Island Jockey
Club. The event carried the richest
stakes in the world, and this is the way
the result was announced by the
judges:
His Highness first, Yorkville Belle
second, Hagonet third. Time 1:15 1/5.
Distance, three-quarters of a mile.
There were twenty-one starters.
It was the most sensational Futurity
that has been run. The colt that finally
won carried a crushing impost of 130
pounds, and the contending horses were
ridden in the most brilliant manner.
Ed Corrigan, owner of the colt
Huron, had refused to abide by the decision
of the Executive Committee that
his horse was not eligible, and invoked
the aid of court, which granted him
a mandatory injunction. The club
officials, however, decided to fight to
the bitter end.
At the post tension was great. Every
jockey was anxious to get the best of the
start, but Starter Caldwell was determined
there should be no foul, and
roundly lectured the boys. Nearly half
an hour was consumed before the crowd
finally set up the yell "They're off."
They were; Caldwell had caught them
all well in motion, and it was a magnificent
start. Yorkville Belle was first
to show up, but her advantage was
null, and Him, Dagonet, Tringle and
His Highness were quickly lapping on
her at the quarter. Dagonet,
with a wonderful burst of speed, took
the lead, and His Highness and Huron
both moved up. As they swung into
the stretch there was little to choose between
Huron, His Highness, Yorkville
Belle, Dagonet, Mars and Bashford.
Slidderly, McPhern sent Huron a front,
and while there was not a man
on the grounds who had bet on him,
everybody cheered. McLaughlin, however,
quickly sent His Highness after
him, while Murphy was improving
his position on Yorkville Belle. In a
few strides Huron and His Highness
were on even terms, and going for their
lives, lapped by Yorkville Belle.
So it went on until opposite the stand
when McLaughlin gave His Highness
the whip despite the enormous weight,
and the horse responded gamely.
By this time the crowd had become
delirious, and amid the greatest excitement
ever seen here, His Highness
dashed in a winner by a length from
Huron, who beat Yorkville Belle half a
length for place, with Dagonet a length
away.
The judges, however, did not recognize
Huron.
When Jockey Overton went to weigh
to ride Huron, Assistant Secretary
Rorke refused to pass
him. Then Corrigan was wroth. He
sought his lawyer, and in company with
him, demanded that Overton be
weighed. The club officials gave in,
and weighed Overton, but refused to
give Huron a number, and there was no
betting against him and Huron ran.
and finished second, and Corrigan will
now have to sue the club for $5,600 that
belongs to the second horse, the club
officials having awarded it to Yorkville
Belle.
The day was perfect, but the track
was not fast. It was lumpy all over,
wet in spots and fast time was out of
question. The crowd was, without
doubt, the largest one that ever witnessed
a race at Sheepshead Bay.
They began to come early. There was
considerable interest taken in races preceding
the futurity, but when that was
on, a mad rush was made for the betting
ring.

ONE NUT MINK.
Colcord Warns the Public Against
Rushing Into Nevada.
San Francisco, Aug. 29. Governor
Colcord, of Nevada, is in the city. He
desires to warn the public against rushing
into Nevada to work the Pine Nut
mines. He says that while Senator
Haines is undoubtedly honest in his
opinion of the mine, he is not a practical
miner and is too enthusiastic. Governor
Colcord has been over the Pine Nut
region and saw no indication of rich
mineral strikes. Claims at Pine Nut
are all taken up and it is useless for
people to go there now.
Governor Colcord will leave at once
for Pine Nut, and after investigating it
will announce definitely whether or not
the report of rich finds is correct.

had been living off her earnings. The
woman finally refused to furnish him
with money, whereupon he shot her.
The case has been hotly contested, this
being the second trial.

Associated Press Dispatches.
New York, Aug. 29. The World will
publish tomorrow exclusively in America,
but in conjunction with the London
Times, which holds the original manuscript
of the pamphlet prepared by the
family of the late Baroness Marie Yel-
zera, who was found shot to death, together
with her lover Rudolph, the
Crown Prince of Austria, at Mayerling,
January 30, 1889, the pamphlet which
was suppressed by the Austrian imperial
family.
The pamphlet tells the whole story in
a circumstantial manner, and is backed
by autograph letters as to leave no doubt
as to the value of a historical document.
An important feature is the infamous
part played in the tragedy by no less
personage than the niece of the Empress
of Austria. The pamphlet accuses her
of being not only an intermediary but a
blackmailer as well. Briefly summarized,
the story is that Baroness Marie
Yetzera, then 17 years old, fell in love
at first sight with the Crown Prince, and
frequently met him in an ordinary social
way. Finally she entrusted her secret
to Countess Larisch, the Empress of Austria's
niece, and this lady at once
undertook to act as a go-between, while
taking advantage of her knowledge of
the state of affairs to levy a blackmail
upon the Prince.
At one time the mother of the girl
suspected something amiss, but the
Countess Larisch was ready with a
plausible tale. At last the girl fled to
Mayerling by prearrangement with the
Prince, and a few hours later her death
was known to the Emperor, but not by
the distracted mother, who in vain employed
the Chief of Police, and Count
Toafe, the Austrian premier, to cause a
search to be instituted for her daughter.
The truth of a double suicide, or murder
and suicide, is at last definitely established
by this publication.
The pamphlet shows the prince's
mind had long been given to thoughts
of suicide from melancholy, and it was
not hope for both of them that she
resolved to share his death. For the
first time is revealed indignities offered
her dead body. How she was carted
away in a sitting posture between her
two uncles, even the coffin being denied
her relatives when moving her; how
her mother was persecuted and vilified;
how everything was done to lay the
blame on the girl forms a harrowing
story as told by the mother. The alleged
falsehoods circulated about her are exposed,
and the daughter's dying message
is given.
