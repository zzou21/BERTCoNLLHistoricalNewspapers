There was one royal time in the
city of Glendale Thursday night when
all the true and tried Odd Fellows of

Washington Lodge No. 16 gathered
for the purpose of installing their
recently elected officers and indulg
ing in a social seance afterwards.
They didn't have things all their
own way as it happened, however,
for a large contingent from Phoenix,
Mesa and Tempe was on hand to see
that things were done right. And
they were there was no question
about that. The officers were duly
and legally installed after which the
Glendalites resolved themselves into
hosts for the occasion, and the event
that followed is still a happy mem
ory with all who were fortunate
enough to be there. The principal

refreshment was cantaloupe a la
mode. That sounds trite enough to
the traveler of the beaten track of
gustatory enjoyment; but it must be
remembered that not all cantaloupes
are like the Glendale cantaloupes.
Anyway, the Phoenix visitors say
there was never anything like it
since Odd Fellowship was in its
infancy, and so delighted were they
that they are talking about the en
tertainment yet.
And "a la mode" means that each
half cantaloupe was filled to its
margin with ice cream, pink or
white as best suited the complexion
of the guest.
The installation ceremonies were
conducted by W. A. Moeur, district
deputy grand master who was as
sisted by Grand Master R. L. Long
more of Mesa City, Past Grand Mas
ters W. E. James and F. P. Trott,

Grand Secretary Geo. A. Mintz who

served as grand marshal. Past Grand

C. M. Mullen of Tempe. The officers

installed are: Guy R. Sheets, noble

grand; J. M. Hotchkiss, vice grand;

F. W. Aiken, recording secretary; C.

B. Carlton, financial secretary; Berry

Roach, treasurer; N. W. Moxley
right supporter to the noble grand;

John Higgins, left supporter to the

noble grand; John R. Bassett, right

supporter to the vice grand; John

Pearson, left supporter to the vice
grand; Charles Gilbert, warden; O.
O. Liestrath, conductor; Tom Brown,

right scene supporter; Andy Smith,

left scene supporter; J. M. Hotchkiss,

the oldest Odd Fellow in Arizona,
chaplain; Dick Witter, inside guard
ian; W. S. Rogers, outside guardian.
Washington Lodge No. 16 seems to
be enjoying great prosperity having
lately taken in quite a number of

new members and its working organ
ization being composed in large part
of energetic young men. The order
for that matter is flourishing all over
the state and especially in this val
ley where all the lodges are growing
rapidly and taking on that vitality
that comes from a young and am
bitious membership. A number of
the members will go to Buckeye to
night where new officers will also
be installed, and a week hence there
will be a similar excursion to Mesa
City for a similar purpose.
The visitors who went to Glendale
were: Grand Master R. L. Longmore
of Mesa City; W. A. Moeur and C.
M. Mullen of Tempe; Past Grand
Masters W. E. James, N. A. Mor
ford and F. P. Trott, and Grand
Secretary Geo. A. Mintz of Phoenix;
and the following named members
from Phoenix who are not borne
down by weighty titles: T. W. Stall
naker, L. S. Bogart, C. G. Caldwell,

I. S. Scott, E. R. Vincil, W. F. Underhill, R.
R. C. Sloane, C. Glaze,
J. Evans, C. S. Fide,
Frank Massey, F. J. Parr, R. H. Bunch, J. Stiles,
L. R. Templin, W. C. Carroll, F. C.
Scott, J. N. Oliver, and J. J. Elwell.

Monday evening there will occur an
event which, in all probability, will
eventually be of vast importance in
the affairs of this section of the state.
This is a meeting of the men interested
in handling the initial commercial cot
ton crop of the Salt River Valley.
This crop is being grown in the vi-
cinity of Mesa. It is an experiment,
of course; but there is every reason to
believe it will be a successful experi
ment. Quite an acreage has been plant
ed on the ranch owned by O. C. Bull
ock, and many other land owners
devoted a small area to cultivation of
the fiber. Taking the matter as a
whole the crop seems satisfactory, and
according to the views of the experts this
will demonstrate the feasibility
of raising cotton profitably in this sec
tion.

It is only within recent years that
the attention of the federal department
of agriculture has been attracted to
the possibility of growing cotton suc
cessfully in southern Arizona. Last
year a number of experiments were
made and these experiments were
watched carefully by officials of the
general government. In the main the
experiments were satisfactory; and in
a recent bulletin the department voic
es its opinion that a considerable area
in this vicinity can be used profitably
for the growing of this crop.
And if it should turn out that the
department and the other experts are
right it will be a big thing for the Val
ley. For the cotton grown here is one
of the finest kinds grown anywhere in
the world. It is said to be surpassed
only by the famous sea island cotton,
and next to that product commands the
highest price paid for any in the mar
ket.

Phoenix entertained a troupe of real
moving picture actors, actorettes and
actor-animals last night, when the
company of Lubins that spread dra
ma and comedy over the hills adjacent
to Douglas for the past three months,
shipped silently into and out of town.
Arriving in force of about eighteen
people and any number of less human
actors, trained horses, cats and chick
ens on the late S. P. train, they quar
tered in the town over night and van
ished in the direction of Prescott via
Santa Fe yesterday morning.
The destination of the movie folk
is old Fort Whipple. The barracks,
hills and dales nearby will be used as
stage settings for a series of westerns,
of the well known comic and dramatic
order.
The troupe enjoyed a private car all
to themselves out of Phoenix, hurrying
on to the next scene in their busy
life.
For several months the moving pic
ture people have been operating at
Tucson. The entire country surround
ing the ancient pueblo has been pho
tographed and many of the trains on
the Southern Pacific. San Xavier mis
sion will figure prominently in one of
the reels.

HO! FOR THE "ALFALFA STEW."

Certain Colorado hotel keepers are
declaring for "alfalfa stew."
And, why not, if it is palatable and ap
petizing?
Alfalfa probably is the oldest of the
known large plants of those that are
eaten by the beasts of the field. Per
haps, Nebuchadnezzar had partaken of
a prehistoric "alfalfa stew" when it is
recorded that "he ate grass like an ox."
The high price of meats even before the
days of the beef trust having driven
him to it.
We eat alfalfa translated into the
shape of beef, poultry and pork, for it
is the cheapest food known to the
"feeders," or "finishers," of those pro
ducts for the market. It is highly nit
rogenous, therefore, contains the most
costly element demanded by the hu
man system for the repair of waste.
True, it is highly fibrous, but hardly
more so than graham flour and of
many vegetables that we like.
The chief difficulty appears to be in
the naming. "Alfalfa stew" smacks of
the ordinary. If it were given some
high sounding name that would thrill
the menu card and was pronounced by
gastronomists as a creation it might
leap to fame, but heralded as rescuer
of the plain common people from the
grasp of the powers of predatory
wealth we have been reading the con
vention reports lately and cannot help
using the language of the period its
outlook as a stew appears none too
bright.
The powers of the chef if lent to al
falfa would help mightily. We have
eaten of golden pheasant that was the
obnoxious guinea hen; we have partak
en of canvasback duck that was raised
in a puddle; we have made salad from
olive oil that came from cotton seeds;
we have, in fact, run the gamut of
gastronomic incredulity, and we know
whereof we speak when we arise to pay
tribute to the master of the cuisine.

for the Presidency

W. M. Hart is back in the county
jail after a brief freedom on bond and
he will probably be there for some
time unless he purges himself of the
contempt for which he was committed
or else unless the supreme court finds
that the superior court exceeded its
powers in committing him.
Hart was cited for neglecting the
order of the court to pay to Mrs. Jea
nette Hart the sum of $250 in monthly
installments for the support of herself
and her child, the court having decided
that they stood in the relation of hus
band and wife and that Hart is the
father of the child.
After the judgment of the court com
mitting Hart his attorney, Robert S.
Fisher, made a spirited talk in which
he intimated that the clerk of the court
and the other officials would be pros
ecuted on their bonds. After a long
conference with Hart after he had been
lodged in jail, the attorney began habeas
corpus proceedings in the supreme
court.
