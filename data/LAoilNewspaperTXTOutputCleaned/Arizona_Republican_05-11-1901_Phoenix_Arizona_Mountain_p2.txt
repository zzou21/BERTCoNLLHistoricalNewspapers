PHOENIX, ARIZONA, MAY 11, 1901.

You may remember the story of the
negro minstrels and the two-dollar bill.
In it a colored man comes in to the group
on the stage with a two-dollar bill in his hand and says,
"Any of you lost a two
dollar bill? I just picked one up outside
the door." No one has lost it; but the
end man reminds the finder that he
owes him two dollars, and that now will
be a good time to pay it. The debt is
paid, and another of the company
reminds the end man that he owes him
two dollars, and the note is passed on.
Thus the bill goes from one to another,
until it comes to a colored man who
owes two dollars to the original finder
of the bill, and then it returns to the
man it started with. Just after he re
ceives it a white man rushes in and
calls out, "Any of you picked up a two
dollar bill? I dropped one a few min
utes ago outside this door." "Here's
your two-dollar bill, boss," says the
finder; "you can have it, but we've all
paid all our debts!"
This instructive story is brought to
mind by the account of the invention of
a party in New Hampshire for the
sterilization of bank notes. This inven
tion, which none of the banks seem to
want, involves a sort of cooking of
paper currency when it is in the hands
of the banks. In order to reduce the
danger of infection from it, such a
sterilization might do some good; but
the greatest danger of infection from a
bank note comes chiefly when it is
circulating from hand to hand in the
poorer districts and paying people's
debts over and over again in the same
mysterious fashion that the treasure
trove of the negro minstrels discharged
their obligations. The bank's passing of the note is but a passing incident. Probably the whole matter comes
down to this, that any careful person
who recognizes the danger from germs
in filthy lucre, and wishes to avoid it,
must insist upon having it sterilized
for his benefit; otherwise he won't re
ceive it. If a friend, for instance, meets
this careful person on the street, and
casually remarks, "I'd like to pay you
that ten dollars I owe you," the care
ful person must say "Certainly, old
fellow, but just come down to my office
and let me sterilize the bill on my
patent apparatus for the purpose." He
must then run the risk of having
the debtor put the note back in his
pocket, looking somewhat aggrieved, and
disappear down the street never to re
new his offer. Yet what careful person,
until the fear of germs before his
eyes, would accept an unsterilized bill?
There would be enough in matters af
fecting local interest and neighborhood
sentiment of communities through which the
president is passing, and assuredly there is
enough in the record of
things accomplished during his own
administration to afford him ample
themes for pertinent discussion on his
trip to the Pacific. But the president is
not content with these alone. The mes
sage which he is carrying across the
continent is not simply one of congrat
ulation or of kindly personal greeting.
Steadily and skillfully he is bringing
to the attention of the people the un
finished business of the country, and
enlisting the support of the people for
the programme in which it will be
brought up for future consideration.
That message is the demands of com
mercial expansion, and it has three
items. One is the Isthmian canal,
which was halted in the senate, the
other is the reciprocity treaties which
he urged there; the third is the encour
agement of our ocean marine through
subsidies, a purpose which was only
delayed by "senatorial privilege." To
each of these items the president has
referred repeatedly and may be expect
ed to refer again. It is true that no
allusion was made except in the most in
direct manner by Mr. McKinley in his
speech at the exposition building, and the
words that might have been construed
to be an allusion were perhaps only a
reflection of a wish, for Arizona could
offer no support of these important
measures.
In his significant address on expan
sion before the Memphis board of
trade, in his remarks at McComb that
the way to make other peoples familiar
with our products was to "make them
familiar with our flag," and in his ref
erences elsewhere to the need of en
larging our foreign market, he indicat
ed the direction of his policy. The
president was conducting a propaganda
upon friendly soil when he took this
message to the sound and brought it
west. He will no doubt speak more ex
plicitly upon these subjects at San
Francisco next week.
The Hon. Wiley E. Jones, of Graham
county, is immune. One day last week
while Mr. Jones was demonstrating be
fore an eastern lady his fearlessness in
the presence of a Gila monster, the rep
tile fastened its jaws upon his hand. It
was subsequently pried off and Mr.
Jones was afflicted with a swollen
tongue and burning eyes for an hour.
This incident brought out the circum
stance that about two years ago Mr.
Jones was bitten by another Gila mon
ster. The saurian died. About four
years ago Mr. Jones was bitten by a
playful dog. No serious results were
apprehended or even dreamed of by the
friends of the dog. But about a week
later the animal began exhibiting hy
drophobic symptoms. It was then too
late to do anything for it, and it died
in horrible agony.
The German people are continually
wanting to do things for themselves,
and the troubled kaiser is beginning to
wonder what they have a kaiser for,
anyway.
New Orleans saw the difference be
tween William McKinley and Ben
Butler, even if an occasional Harvard
graduate doesn't.
The American is too thorough a
sportsman to take kindly to the little
joker, particularly in legislation.
The empress dowager may be de
pended upon to "abdicate" every time
there's anything to pay.
General Wilson, not our General Wil
son, rises to remark that collars were
not intended for the soldiers of this
free country.
Wealth is so common nowadays that
it is going to be better form to be poor.
How the allied powers are punishing!

WHAT OTHERS THINK
COMMONER AND COMMONER.
Mr. Bryan's great newspaper, the
Commoner, did not at first startle, then
fascinate the American people. Per
haps it is because it is too cheap. It
possibly is because it doesn't "reach"
the people from the rear end of the
Pullman palace car at $10 a reach. It
is printed at Lincoln, and Doc Bixby of
the Lincoln Journal says:
Now doth the mighty Commoner
Grow commoner every minute.
Because outside of politics,
There's not a d--- thing in it.
Blue-Earth City Post.

COMMENDS DRUG'S WISDOM.
Some people are having fun pounding
Albert Berg because he voted against
the gross earnings bill. Just take the
map and look at Mr. Berg's home at
Warroad at the Lake of the Woods.
Look at his district and then fig
ure out whether his district most
needs a man who is or is
not a friend to the railroads. A
country that fights railroads before it
has them is fighting windmills and
can't help getting the worst of it. It
is only us fellows who live in a country
the railroads have opened up, where
the railroad advantages have brought
in settlers until nearly every acre is
under cultivation, and where these set
tlers have grown well-to-do; only we
can afford to be sassy to the railroads.
SCOTT'S EMULSION
of cod-liver oil is the means of
life, and enjoyment of life to
thousands: men, women and
children.
When appetite fails, it re
stores it. When food is a
burden, it lifts the burden.
When you lose flesh, it brings
the plumpness of health.
When work is hard and
duty is heavy, it makes life
bright.
It is the thin edge of the
wedge; the thick end is food.
But what is the use of food,
when you hate it, and can't di
gest it ?
Scott's Emulsion of cod
liver oil is the food that makes
you forget your stomach.
If you have not tried it, send for free sample,
its agreeable taste will attract you.

Even then it isn't pay to be too sas
sy. We believe if Albert Berg was sent
to St. Paul to do what was best for his
own section of his district, he did it,
and did it honestly, too. Alexandria
Post News.

MR. STEAD'S GLOOMY VIEW.
The Rev. Wm. T. Stead seems to
have survived his usefulness. He has
arrived at a stage in life when he "sees
things." One of the things he thinks
he sees is a war between Great Britain
and the United States. That treaty, ac
cording to Mr. Stead, will be torn into
shreds and patches when congress
meets, and Great Britain will have to
choose between fighting and eating. He
points to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. If
that treaty is invalidated it will, he says,
whelm the pack of financiers over treaty
obligations that may impose some unreasonable
conditions on the construction of an
isthmian canal. San Francisco Bulle
tin.

BETTER THAN WAR.
When Great Britain pronounces the
outcome of her controversy with Vene
zuela with the gravity of the situation
in South Africa she can hardly fail to
see that arbitration is not only much
cheaper than war, but is more satis
factory in every other respect. San
Francisco Call.

A BUDDING ORATOR.
"Secretary Hay might be termed an
undeveloped orator," gossips a corres
pondent of the Chicago Record-Herald.
"He never made a speech in his life
until he was appointed ambassador to
England, and that fact was given us a
good reason for his selection, because
he followed a man who was criticized
for his loquacity. But he had not been
in London long when he began to de
liver some of the best orations ever
heard in that ancient city. He is rather
timid on his feet, but whenever he
has anything to say he can say it as
well as anybody."

The development of smallpox among
Porto Ricans on Kauai several weeks
after their landing at Honolulu should
indicate the necessity of fumigating the
effects of immigrants. This ought to
take precedence of fumigation of mail
matter as it safeguards Honolulu Re
publican. Dr. Decrolx, the founder of the
French Anti-Tobacco society, and a
zealous advocate of horseflesh as food,
died recently in Paris, at the age of 80
years. He was born at Prsy, Pas-de-
Calais, and became the chief military
veterinary surgeon of the French army.
He saw service in Africa, the Crimea
and Lombardy and in the war of 1870.
His Algerian experience convinced him
of the wholesomeness of horseflesh.

In the earlier days of freedom almost
every negro who learned to read would
receive "a call to preach" within a few
days after he began reading. He tells
of a colored man in Alabama who one
hot day in July, while he was at work
in the field, looking toward the skies, said: "O Lawd,
Lawd, de cotton am so grassy, de work am so
hard; and de sun am so hot, I b'lieve
dis darky am called to preach!"

"Anyone who ever had any business
transactions with the late D'Oyly Carte,"
writes a dramatist, "must have been
struck by the liberal way in which he
managed his dealing. I remember at one time he was
paying me royalties due on a piece being
played in America.
I happened to
be in want of a certain
sum of money
and offered to forego my been on payment of the same. 'No,' said Carte, 'I
won't do that, but if you will draw
what you want in advance I shall be
delighted to oblige you.' How very dif
ferent on a similar occasion was the
conduct of another London manager.
He not only jumped at the commuta
tion of his liabilities, but wanted to
knock down the money to a third of
what I eventually received."

Col. FitzGeorge bears a strong family
likeness to his father, the Duke of Cam
bridge. He is a very quiet, popular
man, whose words are generally to the
point. No one could be more kindly
attentive to his father, and his only ap
parent recreation since he retired from
the service is smoking. He is a good
shot and a fearless rider. Those who
know him best say he would have en
joyed an active military career, but felt
himself continually thwarted by the
accident of his birth, for he always
fancied his positions were given by
his father, and not earned by his
merits.
