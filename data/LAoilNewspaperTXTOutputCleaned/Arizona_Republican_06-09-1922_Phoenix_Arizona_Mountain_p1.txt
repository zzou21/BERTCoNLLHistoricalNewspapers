THIRTY-THIRD YEAR

BONUS BILL
IS FORMALLY
PRESENTED IN
U. S. SENATE
Senate Compensation Bill
Placed On Calendar At
Night Session; Williams
Blocks Measure At First
WASHINGTON, June 8.—The
soldier bonus bill was formally pre
sented tonight to the senate after
a first effort by Chairman McCum
ber, of the finance committee, to
report it at the opening of the ses
sion had been blocked by Senator
Williams, Democrat, of Mississippi.
Senator Williams was absent from
the senate when Senator McCumber
presented the measure for the second
time, but came into the chamber a
few minutes afterward. The presen
tation followed a quorum call and
was without discussion. The bill
automatically went to the senate
calendar. In attempting to offer the
bill soon after the senate met at 11
a. m. today, Senator McCumber said
that “in the very near future I hope
to be able to lay aside the tariff bill
for a day or so for the purpose of
considering, and passing, if possible,
the compensation bill.”
“In the soldiers’ compensation
bill,” he added, “we have nothing but
an American bill. I hope we shall
be able to dispose of it as an Ameri
can measure in the same spirit that
we voted for appropriations to carry
on the war."
Senator Underwood, the demo
cratic leader, expressed the hope that
when the bill was called up it would
be by a vote of the senate and that
unanimous consent for its considera
tion would not be requested. He said
if it was proposed to pass the bill at
this session it might as well be con
sidered now as in July or August.
"I should be very glad,” he added,
“if the bill went over until after the
elections so that the American peo
ple might have an opportunity to
voice their sentiments on the sub
ject.” Senator Underwood said he
felt that the house bill, if passed,
“will not only work injury to the
American people but will in the end
work an injury to the men it pro
poses to help.” He estimated the
bill would cost anywhere from $4,-
000,000,000 to $7,000,000,000 and said it
was drawn in such a way that it
would have to be paid for in the fu
ture and thus would become a burden
upon the ex-soldiers themselves.
“I realize so far as I am con
cerned,” he continued, “that any ef
fort on my part to prevent the pas
sage of this bill will be practically
futile. I recognize that what I say
represents on the democratic side
only a few senators and only a few
senators on the republican side.”
Ashurst Defends Bill
Senator McCumber then sought to
send the bill to the senate calendar
under a unanimous consent agree
ment, made necessary by the parlia
mentary procedure but Senator Wil
liams, an opponent of the measure,
objected. Jumping to his feet, Sen
ator Ashurst, Democrat, Arizona, said
the “war profiteers” had been paid
their claims against the government,
but that every time it was proposed
to compensate the soldiers objection
was made. Urging Senator McCum
ber to make a motion to bring the
bill before the senate, he shouted that

RAIL WORKERS WILL
APPEAL TO HARDING
TO STOP WAGE CUTS
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 8.—
President Harding will be appealed
to by the leaders of 1,200,000 railroad
workers, part of whom have already
received wage cuts from the railroad
labor board due July 1, in an effort
to stave off further reductions in
their pay envelopes, it was decided at
a conference of rail union heads to
night.
Leaders of the eleven railroad em
ployes organizations, which Tuesday
decided to take a strike vote of their
memberships, agreed tonight to out
line a letter to the President pre
senting their argument for higher
wages, or at least, no further reduc
tions. A committee of union execu
tives was appointed by B. M. Jew
ell, president of the railroad em
ployes department of the American
Federation of Labor to draft the
letter.
Approximately $110,000,000 will be
lopped from the payrolls of the 400,-
000 shopcrafts and the 500,000 main
tenance of way men under orders of
the board July 1. The new rates
were branded as “starvation wages"
by the union leaders and it is their
intention in the letter to President
Harding to demand whether the
country's chief executive thinks
these wages sufficient “to maintain
an American standard of living, and
properly sustain a family.”
It is understood that the letter
will contain specific figures on what
the railroad men consider an ade
quate wage and will endeavor to re
fute the position of the railroad labor
board as set forth in their recent
wage reduction decisions.
