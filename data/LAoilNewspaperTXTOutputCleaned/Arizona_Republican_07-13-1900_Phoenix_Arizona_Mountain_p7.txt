WEATHER.
The temperature has averaged below
normal during the week. During the
latter part there was an increase of
mean temperature, due to high minima.
Sensible temperature increased to a
marked degree on account of higher rel-
ative humidity. The occurrence of a
light frost on the 4th is reported from
Flagstaff. No rain is reported from
any section.

CROPS.
The drought conditions are unbroken
throughout the Territory and the situa-
tion has become serious in localities.
Water for irrigation is practically ex-
hausted, and the subterranean supply is
sinking to lower levels. Except in a
few favored sections, vegetation is
making no growth, and fruits of all
kinds are suffering. The intense arid-
ity has greatly injured the vineyards,
and the production is of inferior qual-
ity. Pasturage has deteriorated and
the ranges have dried out in many
places.
The most favorable reports are re-
ceived from the valley of the Colorado,
where there is an abundance of water
for irrigation. The fourth crop of al-
falfa is being harvested and summer
planting is in progress.

TOOK HIM FOR A FOREIGNER.
An English bicyclist was coming at
great speed down one of the steepest
streets in Edinburgh, when his machine
slipped and landed him in the middle
of the road.
Two carters were passing and they
promptly came to his assistance.
"Mon, hoo did ye fa'?" kindly in-
quired one of the carters, to which he
received this answer:
"I was coming down that declivity
with such velocity that I lost my grav-
ity and fell on the macadamized road."
The carter turned from the unfortu-
nate rider with true insular contempt.
"Swat, Jock," he said to his mate, "If
I'd kent the cratur' wis a forriner he
would hae lain in the gutter lang
eneuch for me." London Spare Moments.

Acker's English Remedy will stop a
cough at any time, and will cure the
worst cold in twelve hours, or money
