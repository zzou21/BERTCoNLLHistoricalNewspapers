Los Angeles, Cal., June 17. According to a telegram received here today from Tommy Ryan, the former middleweight champion and trainer for Jim Flynn, in the latter's scheduled battle with Jack Johnson, July 4th, Ryan has become disgusted with Flynn, declares he has no chance to win, and has severed his connection with the challenger's camp.
The message, addressed to the sporting editor of a morning newspaper, reads:
"East Los Vegas, N. M., June 17. Am disgusted with Flynn. He is hog fat and has no chance whatever with Johnson. I refuse to have my name used any further in connection with this affair and am leaving camp tonight. Please notify Associated Press.
(Signed) 'TOMMY RYAN.'"

WINSLOW DEFEATS THE LOCAL APPRENTICE TEAM
Winslow, Ariz., June 17. Winslow Sunday defeated the Albuquerque apprentice aggregation of ball players by a score of 6 to 1. The game was well played, and both teams pulled off stunts that would look well in league ball.
Winslow drew three runs in the first session, two of which were unearned. Then both teams settled down to real ball playing and did excellent work. Both pitchers allowed but few hits to the opposing teams, and fielding was brilliant.

LAS VEGAS MAN IS KILLED BY AUTOMOBILE
While refusing to commit himself on the subject, Governor McDonald's attitude remains as it always has.
EXECUTIVE TO VISIT MEADOW CITY SOON
Going There, It is Said, to Confer with Citizens and May Make Announcement of Position Then.

JUAREZ TO FIGHT FOR FIGHT.
El Paso, June 17. "I will put up a big guarantee to secure the Johnson-Flynn battle for Juarez," said Dick Smith tonight when told that Governor McDonald would do all in his power to stop the fight at Las Vegas.
Smith, with his partner, J. K. Russell, have the concession for fights in the Juarez bull ring, and are now staging a fight between Jack Herrick, of Chicago, middleweight, and Howard Morrow. Smith said that the bull ring, with extra seats built in, would accommodate 10,000 persons. He will wire Jack Curley tonight, making an offer.

Lightweights Battle Twenty Rounds to Even Decision; Congo Kid Too Much for Jimmy Donovan.
Yoakum opened the fifteenth with a right swing to Newman's head. At close quarters Newman sent right and left to stomach and hooked up points to face. Newman was too clever and had the round by a good margin.
The sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth rounds saw both, hunting hard and trying to land a knockout. What Yoakum lacked in velocity he made up in steam, his blows seeming to do more damage, though Newman repeatedly landed his undercuts to head and body. Newman had the sixteenth round, but Yoakum had a shade in the seventeenth and the eighteenth.
In the nineteenth with the fans cheering Yoakum on, Newman showed a flash of speed that bewildered the Texas boy.

While refusing to commit himself as to his attitude on the proposed Johnson-Flynn championship battle at Las Vegas, further than to state that his position remains exactly as it always has that he will prevent the contest if he has the authority of law, it is believed that Governor McDonald does not intend to permit the staging of the battle as scheduled.
Governor McDonald was in the city last night on his way to Santa Fe from a trip to Belen. He was pressed for a statement by local newspaper men, but positively declined to be interviewed on the subject. The governor would not talk for publication further than to reiterate his statement was the same now as it had always been and substantially as he had been quoted in interviews by The Morning Journal's correspondent at Santa Fe several weeks ago.
However, the rumor is current that the governor has been shown that he has ample authority to prevent the fight and that he will take action at the proper time.
The governor, it is understood, is going to Las Vegas in a few days, at the special invitation of the Las Vegas promoters of the proposed fistic engagement, and after his trip there and conference with citizens, he is expected to issue a formal statement.
What promoter Jack Curley and his co-promoters intend to do in the event they are not permitted to put on the contest there is not known, but Juarez, Mex., seems to offer the only possible haven for the fight if it is prevented at Las Vegas.

500 POLICEMEN TO GUARD COLISEUM
Chicago, June 17. Five hundred policemen, including 10 plain clothes detectives, will be on hand tomorrow morning to assist in preserving order at the opening of the Republican convention. Chief McWeney's orders to Assistant Chief Schuetler and Captain O'Linn, are that they take their instructions only from the sergeant at arms of the convention.
Mayor Harrison has personally assured the convention officers that the entire police reserve, or the same number he backed of his pledge to preserve peace in and about the convention hall.

PECULIAR VERDICT GIVEN AT ROSWELL
Roswell, N. M., June 17. One of the most peculiar verdicts ever delivered in this district was given by the jury today, when they found M. Barnard guilty of murder in the second degree. They were charged with murdering Hevid P. Prather on July 2, 1911, in the same trial as neither tried to clear himself of the charge.

SANTA FE THINKS IT'S ALL OVER WITH FIGHT
Santa Fe, N. M., June 17. It is reported here this afternoon on what appears to be the best of authority that Governor McDonald has finally made up his mind that there will be no fight in Las Vegas July 4th between Johnson and Jim Flynn.
The governor has never given the fight promoters any encouragement, although thus far he has not definitely announced that he will prevent the bout in the absence of any specific law on the subject.
Some days ago, however, a committee of Santa Fe business men called on the governor and requested that he make a definite statement on the subject. This the governor promised to do within a few days and this afternoon it is reported that he has decided to prevent the fight. The interest of the Santa Fe men in the affair arose from the fact that the de Vargas day celebration date had been fixed for the 3rd instead of the 4th of July in order that people might have opportunity of visiting both Las Vegas and Santa Fe, and it was expected that many of the easterners attracted to Las Vegas for the fight would visit Santa Fe for de Vargas day. In the other hand, it there was to be no fight, the committee in charge of de Vargas day desired that the celebration be held on Independence day.
Just what means the governor will use to stop the fight is not known, but that he has ample authority in the premises no one here doubts. In fact, it is the general belief that his mere word would be sufficient to drive the fighters and promoters from the state.

Cincinnati, O., June 17. Wishing Ring, a 4-year-old colt owned by J. H. Kesspass, the Cincinnati turfman, won the sixth race at Latonia at odds of over $5 to $1, one of the largest prices ever laid against a winning horse.

The Yoakum-Newman Contest 11th Round
Yoakum assumed the aggressive in the opening round and did most of the landing.
The boys fought to a clinch at the opening of the fifth round, Newman covering up as Yoakum forced the fighting. Yoakum sent left to stomach and Newman retaliated with right to jaw. Newman then shot hard left to wind and they clinched. In break Yoakum sent left to head. The round was even.
In the sixth Newman took the aggressive and sent right to head and left uppercut to stomach. Yoakum swung left to jaw and Newman fought back desperately. Newman was bleeding freely. Yoakum sent terrific right to head and then jabbed Newman's sore nose. Yoakum sent left to face and then repeated with a terrific swing that staggered Newman. It was all Yoakum's round.
Yoakum went after Newman when the seventh round opened and landed right and left to jaw in succession. Newman tried to block the blows and covered up. Newman sent a stinging left to jaw at bell. It was Yoakum's round easily.
In the eighth they fought to a clinch. Yoakum whipped hard left to head and Newman clinched. Yoakum caught Newman flush on jaw with hard right and then shot left to head. Yoakum missed a left to face and they were clinched at 1m-11. It was another round for Yoakum.
In the ninth, though the boys had been going at a fast pace, neither slowed up. Newman walked into right jab for three. Newman missed right swing and both fought fiercely to a clinch. Yoakum did damage in the clinches and at the break he sent right and left to wind. Newman suddenly opened up and bewildered Yoakum with his speed and cleverness, chopping right and left to face and body in rapid succession. It was Newman's round by a good margin.
In the tenth Newman sent right to face as a starter, and missed left swing. Yoakum bored in and literally mothered Newman with swings to head and body, cutting open his face and bringing blood from his nose and mouth. Newman fought back wildly. It was Yoakum's round.
In the eleventh the men fought furiously, each rushing the other to the ropes in turn and exchanging punch for punch. Newman laced right uppercut to stomach and Yoakum sent left to jaw. This round was even.
In the twelfth the boys fought to a clinch. Yoakum at the break sent right and left to face. They then exchanged punches in the center of the ring. Yoakum ended the round by hitting Newman flush on the jaw with a right swing. He followed it up with a left punch to the same place and had the Denver boy hanging on. It was Yoakum's round by a good margin.
The thirteenth was a furious round with both boys mixing it and exchanging blows for blows. Though Newman landed perfectly, his blows seemed to lack steam, while Yoakum's blows were solid and effective.
In the fourteenth both boys fought wildly and the round ended with honors even. In the fifteenth both boys fought fiercely and the round ended with an increase in the guarantee by one of the men.

(By Morning Journal special to the Journal.)
New York, June 17. The one notable feature of today's stock market was the fact that it marked almost the smallest volume of operation for the year. From the opening until its close trading was dull. The movement was restricted except in railroads, particularly the tobacco list. Politics formed the one absorbing topic and news from Chicago was awaited eagerly. Veteran observers opined that the market is likely to continue in deadlock until after the conventions. Prices of stocks were irregular with weakness in Canadian Pacific. The list hardened toward the end of the day when Canadian Pacific had recovered the greater part of its decline. Final dealings were attended with moderate activity.
There were two important announcements of interest, or that list includes Pullman.
