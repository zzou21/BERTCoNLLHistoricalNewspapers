SECTION 1. For the purpose of providing a
fund for the payment of the indebtedness hereby
authorized to be incurred by the board of
state harbor commissioners for the construction
of wharves, piers, seawall, state railroad, spurs,
betterments and appurtenances, and necessary
dredging and filling in connection therewith,
in the city and county of San Francisco, at
a cost not to exceed sixty million dollars
(which said wharves, piers, seawall, state
railroad, spurs, betterments and appurtenances
and necessary dredging and filling in connection
therewith in the city and county of San
Francisco, the board of state harbor commissioners
is hereby empowered to construct
and do, in the manner provided by law, and
in a sum not to exceed said sixty million dollars,
the State Treasurer shall immediately after
the issuance of the proclamation by the Governor,
provided for in Section 10 of this act, prepare
one thousand suitable bonds of the State of
California, in the denomination of one thousand
dollars each. The whole issue of said bonds
shall not exceed the sum of sixty million dollars,
and said bonds shall bear interest at the rate
of four per centum per annum from the date
of issuance thereof, and both principal and
interest shall be payable in gold coin of the
present standard value and they shall be payable
at the office of the State Treasurer at the
expiration of twenty-four years from their date,
subject, however, to redemption by lot as in
this act hereinafter provided. Said bonds shall
bear date the second day of July, nineteen hundred
and eleven, and shall be made payable on
the second day of July, nineteen hundred and
thirty-five, and four hundred of said bonds in
consecutive numerical order shall be made payable
on the second day of July, in each and
every year thereafter until and including the
second day of July, nineteen hundred and
thirty-five. The interest accruing on such of
said bonds as are sold shall be due and payable
at the office of the State Treasurer on the
second day of January, and on the second day
of July, of each year after the sale of the same:
provided, that the first payment of interest
shall be made on the second day of January,
A.D. 1912, on so many of said bonds as may
have been theretofore sold. At the expiration
of twenty-four years from the date of said bonds,
all bonds held shall cease to bear interest, and
likewise all bonds redeemed by lot shall cease
to bear interest as in this act provided, and
the said State Treasurer shall call in, forthwith
pay and cancel the same, out of the moneys in
the San Francisco harbor sinking fund provided
for in this act, and he shall on the third Monday
of January, A.D. 1936, also cancel and destroy
all bonds not theretofore sold. All bonds issued
pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be
signed by the Governor, countersigned by the
Controller, and endorsed by the State Treasurer,
and each shall have the seal of the State
stamped thereon. Each of said bonds shall contain
a clause that it is subject to redemption
by lot after the year nineteen hundred and
fifty.
SECTION 2. Interest coupons shall be attached
to each of said bonds, so that such coupons
may be removed without injury to or mutilation
of the bond. The said coupons shall be consecutively
numbered, and shall bear the lithographic
signature of the State Treasurer who shall
be in office on the second day of July, nineteen
hundred and eleven. No interest shall be paid
on any of said bonds for any time which may
intervene between the date of said bond and the
day of sale thereof, unless such accrued interest
shall have been, by the purchaser of said
bond, paid to the State at the time of such sale.

SECTION 3. The sum of ten thousand dollars is
hereby appropriated to pay the expense that
may be incurred by the State Treasurer in having
said bonds prepared. Said amount shall be
paid out of the San Francisco harbor improvement
fund on Controller's warrants, duly drawn
for that purpose.
SECTION 4. When the bonds authorized to be
issued under this act shall be duly executed,
they shall be held by the State Treasurer and
sold at public auction to the highest bidder for
cash, in such parcels and numbers as said Treasurer
shall be directed by the Governor of the
State, under the seal thereof, after a resolution
requesting such sale. Such resolution shall
have been adopted by the board of state harbor
commissioners, and approved by either the
Governor of the State or Mayor of the city and
county of San Francisco, who shall only approve
those who in their judgment the actual harbor
receipts, and those reasonably anticipated, will
justify such sale of bonds and the consequent
increased burden on harbor receipts; but said
Treasurer must reject any and all bids for said
bonds, or for any of them, which shall be below
the par value of said bonds so offered for sale,
plus the interest which has accrued thereon
between the date of sale and the last preceding
interest maturity date; and he may, by public
announcement at the time and place fixed for
the sale, continue such sale as to the whole of
the bonds offered, or any part thereof offered,
to such time and place as he may select. Before
offering any of said bonds for sale the said
Treasurer shall detach therefrom all coupons
which have matured or will mature before the
date fixed for such sale. Due notice of the time
and place of sale of all bonds, and of the postponement
of sale thereof, must be given by said
Treasurer by publication in two newspapers published
in the city and county of San Francisco,
and also by publication in one newspaper published
in the city of Oakland, and by publication
in one newspaper published in the city of
Los Angeles, and also in one newspaper published
in the city of Sacramento, once a week
for four weeks prior to such sale. In addition
to the notice last above provided for, the State
Treasurer may give such further notice as he
may deem advisable, but the expenses and cost
of such additional notice shall not exceed the
sum of five hundred dollars for each sale so
advertised. The cost of such publication shall
be paid out of the San Francisco harbor improvement
fund, on Controller's warrants, duly
drawn for that purpose. The proceeds of the
sale of such bonds, except such amount as may
have been paid as accrued interest thereon,
shall be forthwith paid over by said Treasurer
into the treasury, and must be by him kept in
a separate fund, to be known and designated as
the "Second San Francisco Seawall Fund" and
must be used exclusively for the construction
of wharves, piers, seawall, state railroad, spurs,
betterments and appurtenances, and necessary
dredging and filling in connection therewith,
on the water front of the city and county of
San Francisco. Drafts and warrants upon said
fund shall be drawn upon and shall be paid out
of said fund in the same manner as drafts and
warrants are drawn upon and paid out of the
San Francisco harbor improvement fund. The
amount that shall have been paid at the sale
of said bonds as accrued interest on the bonds
sold shall be, by the State Treasurer, immediately
after such sale, paid into the treasury
of the State and placed in the "Second San
Francisco Seawall Sinking Fund."
SECTION 5. For the payment of the principal
and interest of said bonds a sinking fund, to be
known and designated as the "Second San
Francisco Seawall Sinking Fund" shall be, and
the same is hereby created, as follows, to wit:
The State Treasurer, after the second day
of July, nineteen hundred and eleven, shall,
on the first day of each and every month thereafter,
after the sale of said bonds, take from the
San Francisco harbor improvement fund such
sum as, multiplied by the time in months, the
bonds then sold and outstanding have to run,
will equal the principal of the bonds sold
and outstanding at the time and Treasurer shall
so take said sum from said San Francisco harbor
improvement fund, less the amount theretofore
taken therefrom for said purpose; and he shall
place the sum in the second San Francisco
seawall sinking fund created by this act. Said
State Treasurer shall, on Controller's warrants
duly drawn for that purpose, employ the moneys
in said sinking fund in the purchase of
bonds of the United States, or of the State of
California, or of the several counties or municipalities
of the State of California, which said
bonds shall be kept in a proper receptacle, appropriately
labeled; but he must keep always
on hand a sufficient amount of money in said
sinking fund with which to pay the interest on
such of the State bonds herein provided to be
issued as may have theretofore been sold. And
to provide means for the payment of interest
on the bonds that may be sold and outstanding,
said Treasurer shall monthly take from the
San Francisco harbor improvement fund, and
pay into said seawall sinking fund, an amount
equal to the monthly interest then due on all
bonds then sold, delivered and outstanding.
The board of state harbor commissioners are
hereby authorized and directed by the collection
of dockage, tolls, rents, wharfage and
cranage to collect a sum of money sufficient for
the purposes of this act, over and above the
amount limited by section two thousand five
hundred and twenty-six of the Political Code of
the State of California, between the first and
tenth day of May, in the year nineteen hundred
and fifty, and between the first and tenth day
of May of each year thereafter, until the maturity
of said bonds, the said Treasurer shall, in
the presence of the Governor, proceed to draw
by lot such an amount of bonds as will he requisite
to exhaust as nearly as may be the amount
in said sinking fund at that time, and shall
thereupon and before the tenth day of June
following give notice by public advertisement
to be inserted twice a week for two weeks in
two newspapers published in the city and county
of San Francisco, and also in one newspaper
published in the city of Oakland, and also in
one newspaper published in the city of Los
Angeles, and also in one newspaper published
in the city of Sacramento, stating the number
of bonds so drawn, and that the principal of
said bonds will be paid on presentation to the
Treasurer on or before the second day of July,
following, and that from and after such last
named date all interest upon bonds thus drawn
shall cease, and it shall be the duty of the Treasurer
as soon as said bonds so drawn by lot are
surrendered to him and paid, to cancel the
same, and the interest coupons thereon, and
each year, beginning with the year nineteen
hundred and fifty, the said Treasurer shall, in
the manner aforesaid, proceed to draw by lot
such an amount of bonds as shall be requisite
to exhaust as nearly as may be the amount in
said sinking fund, and proceed in the manner
hereinabove provided. After the payment of
all said bonds, the surplus or balance remaining
in said sinking fund, if any there be, shall
forthwith be paid into the San Francisco harbor
improvement fund. At the time of the respective
drawings by lot, as aforesaid, and also at the
maturity of said State bonds, said Treasurer
shall sell the United States or other bonds then
in said sinking fund, at governing market rates,
after advertising the sale thereof in the manner
hereinbefore provided for the sale of bonds
hereby authorized to be issued, and shall use
the proceeds for the payment of such bonds as
may be drawn by lot, and at the maturity of
said bonds outstanding shall pay and redeem
said matured outstanding bonds out of said
money in said fund in partial liquidation of said
bonds on Controller's warrants duly drawn for
that purpose.

The State of California is hereby authorized
to incur an indebtedness in the manner provided

dollars.
Immediately after the issuance of the first
installment of the principal of the bonds, as provided
in Section 11 of this act, the Treasurer
of the State of California shall prepare one
thousand suitable bonds of the State of California,
in the denomination of one thousand dollars
each. The whole issue of said bonds shall not

at the office of the State Treasurer of the
State of California, on the second day of January,
and on the second day of July, of each and
every year after the sale of the same. The
interest accruing on such of said bonds as are

and on the second day of July, of each year
after the sale of the same: provided, that the
first payment of interest shall be made on the
second day of January, A.D. 1910, on so many
of said bonds as may have been theretofore sold.
At the expiration of twenty-four years from
the date of said bonds, all bonds held shall
cease to bear interest, and likewise all bonds
redeemed by lot shall cease to bear interest as
in this act provided, and the said State Treasurer
shall call in, forthwith pay and cancel the
same, out of the moneys in the state highway
sinking fund provided for in this act, and he
shall on the third Monday of January, A.D. 1934,
also cancel and destroy all bonds not theretofore

SECTION 2. Interest coupons shall be attached
to each of said bonds, so that such coupons
may be removed without injury to or mutilation

issued by this act shall have been duly executed,
they shall be held by the State Treasurer and
sold at public auction to the highest bidder for
cash, in such parcels and numbers as the Governor
of the State shall direct, provided a resolution
requesting such sale shall have been adopted
by the advisory board of the Department of
Engineering, and approved by the Governor of
the State. Such resolution shall specify the
amount of money which, in the judgment of said
advisory board shall be required at such time,
and the Governor of the State shall direct the
State Treasurer to sell such number of said
bonds to raise said amount of money, and that
said bonds shall be sold in consecutive, numerical
order. The State Treasurer shall not
accept any bid which is less than par value of
the bond, plus the interest which has accrued
thereon between the date of sale and the last
preceding interest maturity date. The State
Treasurer may, at the time and place fixed by
him for such sale, continue such sale as to the
whole or any part of the bonds offered, to such
time and place as he may select, not exceeding,
however, sixty days. Before offering any of
said bonds for sale the said Treasurer shall
detach therefrom all coupons which have matured
or will mature before the date fixed for
such sale. Due notice of the time and place of
sale of all bonds, and of the postponement of
sale thereof, must be given by said Treasurer

last above provided for, the State Treasurer
may give such further notice as he may deem
advisable, but the expenses and cost of such
additional notice shall not exceed the sum of
five hundred dollars for each sale so advertised.
The cost of such publication shall be paid
out of the state highway fund, on Controller's
warrants, duly drawn for that purpose. The
proceeds of the sale of such bonds, except such
amount as may have been paid as accrued interest
thereon, shall be forthwith paid over by
said Treasurer into the treasury, and must be
by him kept in a separate fund, to be known and
designated as the "State Highway Fund," and
must be used exclusively for the construction
of rights of way for and the acquisition and
construction of said system of state highways.
The route or routes of said state highways shall
be determined by the Department of Engineering,
and said highways shall be selected and

acquired as to constitute a continuous and connected
state highway system running north

Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys and along
the Pacific coast by the most direct and practicable
routes, connecting the county seats of
the several counties through which it passes and
joining the several county seats lying east and
west of such state highway.

fund for the purposes of this act upon
warrants duly drawn by the Controller of the
State upon demands made by the Department of
Engineering and audited by the State Board of
Examiners.

SECTION 5. There is hereby appropriated from

annually as will be necessary to pay the principal
and the interest on the bonds issued and
sold pursuant to the provisions of this act, as

There shall be collected annually in the
same manner and at the same time as other
state revenue is collected such a sum in addition
to the ordinary revenues of the state, as

on said bonds as herein provided, and

by law with the duty in regard to the
collection of said revenue, to do and perform
each and every act which shall be necessary to
collect such additional money.
The Treasurer of the State shall, on the first
day of January, 1910, and on the first day of
each July and the first day of each January
thereafter transfer from the general fund of
the State treasury to the interest and sinking
fund such an amount of the money by this act
appropriated as shall be required to pay the
interest on the bonds theretofore sold, until the
interest on all of said bonds so sold shall have
been paid or shall have become due in accordance
with the provisions of this act.
There is hereby created in the State treasury
a fund to be known and designated as the
"State Highway and Sinking Fund."
The Treasurer of the State shall on the first
day of July of the year 1917, and on the first
day of July of each and every year thereafter
in which any parcel of the bonds sold pursuant
to the provisions of this act shall become
due, transfer from the general fund of the
State treasury to the State highway sinking
fund herein created such an amount of the
moneys appropriated by this act as may be required
to pay the principal of the bonds so becoming
due and payable in such years.
SECTION 6. The principal of all of said bonds
sold shall be paid at the time the same become
due from the State highway sinking fund,
and the interest on all bonds void shall be paid
at the time said interest becomes due from the
interest and sinking fund, both interest and
principal shall be so paid upon warrants duly

demands audited by the State Board of Examiners,
and the faith of the State of California
is hereby pledged for the payment of said bonds

denomination of one thousand dollars each. The
whole issue of said bonds shall not exceed the
sum of one million dollars, and said bonds shall
bear interest at the rate of four per centum per
annum, from the time of the sale thereof, and
both principal and interest shall be payable in
gold coin of the present standard value and they

at the expiration of seventy-four years from
their date, subject, however, to redemption by
lot as in this act hereinafter provided. Said

may be removed without injury to or mutilation

numbered, and shall bear the lithographic
signature of the State Treasurer who shall

hundred and eleven. No interest shall be paid

bond, paid to the State at the time of such sale.

SECTION 3. The sum of one thousand dollars is
hereby appropriated to pay the expense that
may be incurred by the State Treasurer in having
said bonds prepared. Said amount shall be
paid out of the San Francisco harbor improvement
fund on Controller's warrants, duly drawn

of them, which shall be below the par value of
said bonds so offered for sale, and he may by
public announcement at the time and place fixed
for the sale, for good and sufficient cause, continue
such sale as to the whole of the bonds
offered, or any part thereof offered, to such time
and place as he may select, not exceeding,
however, sixty days. Due notice of the time
and place of sale of all bonds, and of the postponement
of sale thereof, must be given by said

the acquisition of the area described in the act
referred to in Section 1 hereof. Drafts and

and shall be paid out of said fund in the same
manner as drafts and warrants are drawn upon

every month after the second day of December,

the bonds sold and outstanding at the time and
Treasurer shall so take said sum from said
San Francisco harbor improvement fund, less
the amount theretofore taken therefrom for said
purpose; and he shall place the sum in the
India basin sinking fund created by this act.
Said State Treasurer shall, on Controller's warrants
duly drawn for that purpose, employ the

sold, delivered and outstanding. The board of
state harbor commissioners is hereby authorized
and directed by the collection of dockage,
tolls, rents, wharfage and cranage, to collect a
sum of money sufficient for the purposes of this
act, over and above the amount limited by Section

published in the city of Sacramento, stating
the number of bonds so drawn, and that the
principal of said bonds will be paid on presentation
to the Treasurer on or before the second
day of July, following, and that from and after
such last named date all interest upon bonds
thus drawn shall cease, and it shall be the duty
of the Treasurer as soon as said bonds so drawn
by lot are surrendered to him and paid, to cancel
the same, and the interest coupons thereon, and
each year, beginning with the year nineteen
hundred and forty, the said Treasurer shall, in
the manner aforesaid, proceed to draw by lot
such an amount of bonds as shall be requisite to
exhaust as nearly as may be the amount in said

CHAPTER 431. An act to provide for the issuance
and sale of state bonds to create a fund
for the construction by the board of state harbor
commissioners for the bay of San Diego
of harbor improvements, to consist of a seawall,
wharves, piers, state railroad, spurs, betterments

of one thousand five hundred dollars
for the expense of printing said bonds; and to
provide for the submission of this act to a vote
of the people.
The people of the State of California, represented
in senate and assembly, do enact as
follows:
SECTION 1. For the purpose of providing a
fund for the payment of the indebtedness hereby
authorized to be incurred by the board of
state harbor commissioners for the construction
of harbor improvements, consisting of a
seawall, wharves, piers, state railroad, spurs, betterments
and appurtenances in the county of
San Diego, at a cost not to exceed one million
five hundred thousand dollars (which said
seawall, wharves, piers, state railroad, spurs, betterments
and appurtenances the board of state
harbor commissioners for San Diego bay is hereby
empowered to construct in the manner
provided by law, and in a sum not to exceed
said one million five hundred thousand dollars),
the State Treasurer shall, immediately after
the issuance of the proclamation by the Governor,
provided for in Section 10 of this act, prepare
one thousand five hundred suitable bonds of
the State of California in the denomination of
one thousand dollars each, to be numbered from
one to one thousand five hundred inclusive, and
to bear date of the second day of July, nineteen
hundred and eleven. The total issue of said
bonds shall not exceed the sum of one million
five hundred thousand dollars, and they shall
bear interest at the rate of four per centum per
annum from the date of issuance thereof. The
said bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable
in gold coin of the United States of the
present standard of value, at the office of the
State Treasurer of the State of California, on
the second day of July, nineteen hundred and
thirty-five, subject, however, to redemption by
lot as in this act hereinafter provided. The
interest accruing on all of said bonds that may
be sold shall be payable at the office of the
State Treasurer on the second day of January,
and on the second day of July, of each year
after the sale of the same. At the expiration of
twenty-four years from the date of said bonds,
all bonds held shall cease to bear interest, and
likewise all bonds redeemed by lot shall cease
to bear interest as in this act provided, and the
said State Treasurer shall call in, forthwith pay
and cancel the same, out of the moneys in the
San Diego seawall sinking fund provided for in
this act, and he shall on the date of the maturity
of said bonds cancel and destroy all bonds
not theretofore sold. All bonds issued pursuant
to the provisions of this act shall be signed by
the Governor of this State, countersigned by the
State Controller, and endorsed by the State
Treasurer, and the said bonds shall be so signed,
countersigned and endorsed by the officers who
are in office on the second day of July, nineteen
hundred and eleven, and each of said bonds
shall have the great seal of the State of California
impressed thereon. Each of said bonds
signed, countersigned, endorsed and sealed as
herein provided, when sold, shall be and constitute
a valid and binding obligation upon the
State of California, though the issue thereof be
made at a date or dates after the person so
signing, countersigning and endorsing, or any
of them, shall have ceased to be the incumbent
of said office or offices.

SECTION 2. Appended to each of said bonds
there shall be interest coupons so attached that
the same may be detached without injury to or
mutilation of said bonds, and said coupons shall
be consecutively numbered, and shall bear the
lithographic signature of the State Treasurer
who shall be in office on the second day of July,
nineteen hundred and eleven. No interest shall
be paid on any of said bonds for any time which
may intervene between the date of said bond and
the day of sale thereof, unless said accrued interest
shall have been, by the purchaser of said
bond, paid to the State at the time of such sale.

SECTION 3. The sum of one thousand five hundred
dollars is hereby appropriated out of
any moneys in the State treasury not otherwise
appropriated to pay the expense that may be
incurred by the State Treasurer in having said
bonds prepared. The State Controller is hereby
authorized and directed to draw his warrants
for the expense incurred in preparing the said
bonds, and the State Treasurer is hereby directed
to pay the same.

SECTION 4. When the bonds authorized to be
issued by this act shall have been signed,
countersigned and endorsed, as in Section 1
provided, the State Treasurer shall sell the
same for cash to the highest bidder in such
parcels and numbers as the Governor of the
State shall direct, provided a resolution requesting
such sale shall have been adopted by
the board of state harbor commissioners for
San Diego bay, and said board shall not pass
such resolution until in their judgment the actual
harbor receipts, and those reasonably anticipated,
will justify such sale of bonds and the
consequent increased burden on harbor receipts.
Said resolution shall specify the number of
bonds necessary to produce the amount of money
which, in the judgment of said board of harbor
commissioners, shall be required at such time,
and the Governor of the State shall direct the
State Treasurer to sell such number of said
bonds to raise said amount of money, and that
said bonds shall be sold in consecutive, numerical
order. The State Treasurer shall not
accept any bid which is less than par value of
the bond, plus the interest which has accrued
thereon between the date of sale and the last
preceding interest maturity date. The State
Treasurer may, at the time and place fixed by
him for such sale, continue such sale as to the
whole or any part of said bonds offered, to such
time and place as he may at the time of such
announcement designate. Before offering any
of said bonds for sale the State Treasurer shall
detach therefrom all coupons which have matured
or will mature before the date fixed for
such sale. The State Treasurer shall give notice
of the time and place of sale by publication in
two newspapers published in the city and county
of San Francisco, one newspaper published
in the city of Los Angeles, one newspaper published
in the city of San Diego, and one
newspaper published in the city of Sacramento,
once a week for four weeks next preceding
the date fixed for such sale. In addition to the
notice last above provided for, the State Treasurer
may give such further notice as he may
deem advisable, but the expenses and cost of such
additional notice shall not exceed the sum of
five hundred dollars for each sale so advertised.
The cost of such publication shall be paid
out of the San Diego harbor improvement fund
on Controller's warrants duly drawn for that
purpose, and the Treasurer must pay the same.
The proceeds of the sale of such bonds shall be
forthwith paid over by said Treasurer into the
treasury, and must be by him kept in a separate
fund to be known and designated as the
"San Diego Seawall Fund," and must be used
exclusively for the construction of a seawall,
wharves, piers, state railroad, spurs, betterments
and appurtenances thereon on the water
front of the bay of San Diego. Drafts and warrants
upon said fund shall be drawn upon and
shall be paid out of said fund in the same manner
as drafts and warrants are drawn upon and
paid out of the San Diego harbor improvement
fund.

SECTION 5. For the payment of the principal
and interest of said bonds a sinking fund, to be
known and designated as the "San Diego
Seawall Sinking Fund," shall be, and the same

Treasurer, after the second day of July, nineteen
hundred and eleven, shall, on the first day

sale of said bonds, take from the San Diego harbor
improvement fund such sum as, multiplied
by the time in months, the bonds then sold and
outstanding have to run, will equal the principal
of the bonds sold and outstanding at the time
and Treasurer shall so take said sum from said
San Diego harbor improvement fund, less the
amount theretofore taken therefrom for said
purpose; and he shall place the sum in the
San Diego seawall sinking fund created by this
act. Said State Treasurer shall, on Controller's
warrants duly drawn for that purpose, employ
the moneys in said sinking fund in the purchase
of bonds of the United States, or of the State
of California, or of the several counties or municipalities
of the State of California, which said
bonds shall be kept in a proper receptacle, appropriately
labeled; but he must keep always
on hand a sufficient amount of money in said
sinking fund with which to pay the interest on
such of the State bonds herein provided to be
issued as may have theretofore been sold. And
to provide means for the payment of interest
on the bonds that may be sold and outstanding,
said Treasurer shall monthly take from the
San Diego harbor improvement fund, and pay
into said seawall sinking fund, an amount equal
to the monthly interest then due on all bonds
then sold, delivered and outstanding. The
board of state harbor commissioners of San
Diego are hereby authorized and directed by
the collection of dockage, tolls, rents, wharfage
and cranage to collect a sum of money sufficient
for the purposes of this act, over and above
any limitations existing in the existing text of
the Political Code of the State of California.
Between the first and tenth day of November,
in the year nineteen hundred and eleven, and
between the first and tenth day of November of
each year thereafter until the maturity of said
bonds, the said Treasurer shall, in the presence
of the Governor, proceed to draw by lot such

from and after such last named date all interest
upon bonds thus drawn shall cease, and it shall

coupons thereon, and each year, beginning with
the year nineteen hundred and eleven, the said
Treasurer shall, in the manner aforesaid, proceed
to draw by lot such an amount of bonds as
shall be requisite to exhaust as nearly as may be
the amount in said sinking fund, and proceed in
the manner hereinabove provided. After the

remaining in said sinking fund, if any there

as may be drawn by lot, and at the maturity of
said bonds outstanding shall pay and redeem
said matured outstanding bonds out of said
money in said fund in partial liquidation of said
bonds on Controller's warrants duly drawn for
that purpose.
