WARNING UNHEEDED BY WORKERS
U. S. Marshals Are On Hand
to Protect Trains and Rail
Road Property and Prevent
Interference of Strikers.
Los Angeles, Calif., Aug. 29.
By a slight majority, 2,000
switchmen and yardmen who
have been on strike here voted
to return to work tomorrow
morning at 7 o'clock.
The members of the four
railway brotherhoods had been
on strike here for more than
a week, following a walk-out
of yardmen in sympathy with
a strike of trainmen of the
Pacific Electric interurban
railway system.
The action of the men will
bring to an end a railroad tie
up without precedent in the
history of the west. It caused
cancellation of trans-continental
trains, left many points in
California without mails for
days and threatened a water
famine at desert points de
pendent on railroad tank cars
for their supplies of that fluid.
While yard employees here,

road crafts to go out, were not
included in the announcement,
according to first reports, it
was anticipated they would
follow the lead of the "Big
Four" members. The same an
ticipation applied to train
men at Barstow, who also
were on strike.
The vote was taken at a mass meet
ing tonight, which was addressed by
A. F. Whitney, international vice
president of the Brotherhood of Rail
way Trainmen,
Following the vote, those who bal
loted not to return to work declared
that, despite the result they would not
return to work. A meeting of those
opposed to returning was called.
The action was predicated directly
on the order of the international of
ficers of the railway brotherhoods to
the union members to return to work,
and followed a warning by Director
General Hines of the railroad admin
istration that unless the men were
at work by 7 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing the government would operate
the trains.
International brotherhood heads
had announced that men who failed to
heed the order to return to work
would forfeit their union membership.
The government, through the United
States marshal here, shortly before the
men's action was announced, had ar
ranged to have a large force of fed
eral officers protect trains and rail
road property and prevent inter
ference with their operation.
STRIKERS ARE BEGINNING
TO REPORT FOR OLD JOBS
Los Angeles, Calif., Aug. 29. Heeding the announcement of the govern
ment that it would run the trains at
all costs after 7 o'clock tomorrow
morning and the determination of
United States Marshal C. T. Walton,
of Los Angeles, that all trains in the
strike area would be given adequate
protection, railroad strikers were be
ginning to return throughout southern
California today.
What was regarded as a critical
situation in fruit transportation in the
Fresno district was saved when the
striking yard and switchmen deter
mined to return late today. Following a visit by A. F. Whitney, a vice
president of the Brotherhood of Rail
road Trainmen, striking workers at
San Bernardino expressed a willingness
to return to work.

today.
Trainmen at Weedles, Calif.
Barstow Still Defiant.
It was reported that the engineers
at San Bernardino, Calif., were plan
ning to return to work tonight and
that trainmen there might follow.
The situation at Barstow was consid
ered grave, trainmen there having
flatly refused to obey the orders of
their superior officers in the railroad
brotherhoods, according to reports.
A. F. Whitney, international vice
president of the Brotherhood of Rail
way Trainmen, who arrived late today,
stated after a conference with M. K.
Montgomery, a representative of the
engineers, he was certain the men
here will return to work before morn
ing. He added that he felt they were
being influenced "by persons with Bol
shevistic tendencies."
"The strike is illegal and absolutely
without sanction of the brotherhoods,"
Mr. Whitney said. "I hope the men
will return to work. If they do not
their places will be taken by other
members of the brotherhood who can
be summoned here in short order."
Operation of trains on the Southern
Pacific, Santa Fe and Salt Lake rail
ways will start tomorrow morning at
7 o'clock, officials of these roads an
nounced today.
If the majority of the men do not
return, railroad officials said, trains
would be operated with crews availa
ble under government protection.
The striking trainmen hold many
meetings today but early tonight had
given out no official statement indi
cating what action would be taken.
Unofficially it was stated a rift in the
ranks of the strikers exists. The con
servative element, according to re
ports, is in favor of returning to work
while the radicals are said to have
stated that they would not return un
til the object for which they struck
the reinstatement of Pacific Electric
trainmen who are on strike, with full
seniority rights is attained.
Representatives of the "Big Four,"
M. E. Montgomery, L. L. Sanford and
R. A. Ford, have been addressing con
ferences and meetings of the striking
men ever since Warren Stone and W.
d. Lee, chiefs of the big brotherhoods,
and Director General of Railroads
Hines ordered them to return.
Los Angeles, Calif., Aug. 29. En
gineers on the Southern Pacific,
Santa Fe and Salt Lake lines began
returning to work late today, and in
dications were that other trainmen
who have been on strike here would
return before tomorrow morning,
when the time limit for their return
by Director General of Railroads
Hines expires.
M. K. Montgomery, vice president
of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, who has been in confer
ence with the men, announced that
he expects the striking members of
all crafts will be back on the job and
trains will be running at 7 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

GOMPERS CONFERS
WITH WILSON ON
STRIKE MATTERS

Head of A. F. of L Consults
President, But Nobody Will
Discuss What Transpired at
the Meeting,
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL WIRE
Washington, Aug. 29. After two
days of conference with other offi
cials of the American Federation of
Labor, President Samuel Gompers,
who returned from Europe this week
rather unexpectedly, discussed the
disturbed labor situation over the
country with President Wilson today
at the White House.
No announcement has been made
on behalf of the president, and Mr.
Gompers and the union officials who
accompanied him, including repre
sentatives of the steel workers, stead
fastly refused to discuss what had
transpired.
It is known, however, that the
president was asked to intervene in
the dispute between the steel workers
and the United States Steel corpora
tion over wages, hours, working con
ditions and the right of collective bar
gaining. Before going to the White House
the committee of steel workers made
public a telegram to the council at
Gary, Ind., in which they charged
that the steel corporation was dis
charging union men at a number of
plants in an effort to force the strike
issue before the president could act.
The men were urged not to strike un
til all efforts at a peaceful settlement
had been made.
The federation's executive commit
tee held two sessions during the day.
The utmost secrecy was maintained,
but it was understood that a number
of labor disturbances over the coun
try were discussed, with particular
attention given to the situation as it
affects railway and steel workers.
Some officials saw in the messages
sent to the railroad shopmen yes
terday and to the steel workers today
a disposition on the part of the labor
leaders to follow the suggestion of
President Wilson that the matter of
wages and working conditions be held
in abeyance until government agen
cies had had time to carry out their
program looking to a reduction of liv
ing costs and a general restoration
of conditions to something approaching
normal.
While the federation chiefs were
meeting with the president, the labor
situation was discussed at the capitol.
Senator Polndexter, republican, of
Washington, urged speedy action on
his resolution asking the president to
call a conference between representa
tives of capital and labor. Chairman
Kenyon of the senate labor commit
tee, said the house and senate com
mittees planned joint action.
OF LOST AVIATORS
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL WIRE
San Diego, Calif., Aug. 29. Lieu
tenants Frederick Waterhouse and
Cecil Connelly, army aviators from
Rockwell field, missing since August
20, have not been found. Previous
reports were that the troops of Gov
Esteban Cantu of Lower California,
Mexico, had located them.
Denial of the earlier report was
brought here late tonight by Maj. C.
Hartwell, commanding American
border patrols, who have been search
ing for the missing men.
Major Hartwell said he got his in
formation direct from American Con
sul Sidney Smith at Ensenada, Lower
California, who telephoned him that
Captain Trujillo, who was reported to
have informed Colonel Barranca that
the men were safe, knew nothing of
the affair. Smith told Major Hart
well Captain Trujillo was sitting in
the American consulate when he read
a report of his message in the Ameri
can papers.
STRIKE AT ELY, NEV.,
FINALLY CALLED OFF
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL WIRE
Ely, Nev., Aug. 29. Under an
agreement accepted this morning by
a committee representing striking
workmen of all crafts in the Ely dis
trict and signed by C. B. Lakenan,
general manager of the Nevada Con
solidated Copper company, work will

The men forfeited all claim to wage
increases in lieu of a guarantee by the
company for improved working con
ditions and establishment of an elab
orate company commissary.
The strikers will vote tonight on
the ratification of the agreement and
the workmen's committee assured
Governor Boyle, who offered the com
promise, that it will be ratified. The

Number of Votes as United
Kingdom's Empire,
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL WIRE
Washington, Aug. 29. The treaty
of peace was aggressively assailed by
its senate foes again today, the for
eign relations committee approving
three more textual amendments to its
provisions and Senator Knox, of
Pennsylvania, a republican member
of the committee and former secreta
ry of state, advising the senate that
the only safe way to deal with it was
to reject it altogether.
Acting by a vote of nine to eight in
each case, the committee adopted
without extended debate amendments
designed to equalize British and
American representation in the league
of nations, to prevent the British do
minions from participating in a
league decision affecting any one of
them, and to curtail the power of the
American representatives on the re
parations commission which is to col
lect Germany's reparation bill.
Opposed By Democrats.
Democratic committee members
presented a solid front against all of
the proposals and were joined by
Senator McCumber, republican, North
Dakota, who also had voted against
the two amendments adopted prior
to today's session. Only one pro
posed amendment now remains on
the committee's calendar, though
others may be presented when con
sideration of the subject is resumed
early next week.
In his senate speech, Senator
Knox declared that the full purpose
of American participation in the war
had been accomplished with the
armistice and that there had been no
reason for projecting the nation into
the European settlements. He said a
complete peace basis could be estab
lished by action of congress as soon
as three of the other principal power
had ratified the treaty, and that such
a course would free the country from
many dangerous possibilities of for
eign entanglements.
Peace Terms Too Severe.
The peace terms imposed upon
Germany, said the Pennsylvania sen
ator, went beyond the pale of Interna
tional law and would be impossible
of enforcement. He characterized
them as constituting "not the treaty
but the truce of Versailles" and as
laying the foundation "for centuries
of blood-letting."
During the day another of the
treaties negotiated at Versailles was
sent to the senate by President Wil
son. It was the treaty made with
Poland by the principal powers and
signed on June 28. With it the pres
ident sent an agreement for occupa
tion of the Rhine signed by the Unit
ed States and other powers on the
same day.
Submission of the Polish treaty, the
Rhine agreement and other data was
requested in a letter sent to the
White House several days ago by the
foreign relations committee, but to
this request the president made no
reference in his letter of transmittal.
Attention was called to the subject,
however, in a brief statement by
Chairman Lodge in the senate and
later Mr. Lodge made public the let
ter of request, saying that the data
asked for was a part of the treaty
with Germany and was essential in
committee consideration of that treaty.
Other Data Called For.
The data called for and not re
ceived by the committee included an
other and previous Rhine agreement
and any available drafts of the trea
ties now under negotiation with Aus
tria, Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary.
Committee members pointed out also
that a long statement by M. Clemen
ceau, as president of the peace confer
ence, attached to British and French
official copies of the Polish treaty,
was not included in the copy sent in
today by the president.
A British print of still another Ver
sailles treaty, an air convention be
tween the United States and various
other nations, was put into the senate
record by Senator Knox. An explana
tory note heading the convention, said
it had not been signed but was being
given to the public for their infor
mation. Mr. Knox said this plan ap
parently had been followed out in
every country except the United
States.
The reparations amendment was
proposed by Senator Fall, republican,
of New Mexico, and the other by Sen
ator Moses, republican, of New
Hampshire. The vote in each case was
nine to eight, the democrats and Sen
ator McCumber voting in the negative.
The vote was 9 to 8. Senator Mc
Cumber, republican, North Dakota,
standing with the democrats against
the amendment.
The amendment was the first to be
adopted by the committee relating to
the league covenant. It was present
ed by Senator Johnson, republican,
California.
The amendment also contains the
same provision regarding the league
council, the effect of which would be
to offset the possibility that Great
Britain and one of her dominions
might be represented on the council
at one time. In the council there are

Hogs Decline More Than $3 a
Hundred Pounds and Dress

Sell at Former Figures,
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL WIRE
Chicago, Aug. 29. Although live
hogs have declined slightly better than
$3 a hundred pounds in three days
and dressed beef was down $2 a
hundred pounds in the wholesale
markets today, with general bearish
sentiment prevailing, consumers in
Chicago today had gained no appar
ent benefit.
The retail price of beef, pork and
mutton continued high, though mut
ton was down with beef and pork in
the wholesale districts. The drop in
live hog prices at the stockyards to
day was about 50 cents below yester
day's general average.
"Wholesale beef prices have shown
an almost steady decline for almost
four months," according to a state
ment from H. H. Swift, vice president
of Swift & Co., today. "Our company's
average wholesale price of beef sold
in Chicago the week ending May 3
was $20.91. The week ending August
16 it was $17.64 as against $16.63 for
the week ending August 23.
"Mutton and lamb wholesale prices
also are off considerably, there hav
ing been a drop of about $1.20 a hun
dred pounds in the last week, and
these lowered prices are also, no
doubt, being reflected to the consumer
by the retailer."

LETTER TO DOUGLAS PAPER
Man Purporting to Be Captor of Aviators Who Were Held For
Ransom Says He Is Quite Alive and Has Part of the Money
Paid; Gives Alleged Details of Capturing Lost Flyers and
of How He and Companions Escaped to El Paso and Later
Went to Douglas and Bisbee; Officers Regard Letter As
Hoax.

(By Morning Journal
Douglas, Ariz., Aug. 29. A letter
purporting to have been written by
Jesus Rentería, bandit captor of
Lieutenants Harold G. Peterson and
Paul H. Davis, of the United States
army, who held them for ransom, has
been received by the DOUGLAS DAILY
DISPATCH, claiming to have evaded the expeditionary force sent
to effect their capture. The letter was
turned over to civil and military au
thorities who are investigating.
The letter, as quoted literally, punc
tuation and all,
Mailed in Douglas, August 29, it
says:
"Douglas, Arizona, Aug. 28, 1919.
"Mr. Editor:
"DOUGLAS DAILY DISPATCH:
"It caused me great surprise when
I read your paper of Tuesday 26th
Inst., saying that I had been killed and
that the notice had been confirmed,
and seeing such notice is absurd, I
wish; therefore, that you would let me
relate some facts about it to convince
you that I am still alive.
"I crossed to Mexico a few days
ago in company of four friends of
mine hoping to find an opportunity
of making some money, as I had been
out of work for many months, and
fortunately the opportunity we met
were splendid.
Discovered Aviators,
"One day we were wandering in
the Ojinaga district when we discov
ered three men about a mile ahead of
us. At first we thought they were
Mexican government patrols, but
when we approached I realized that
they were travelers. Then I decided
to make them give us what they had,
but unfortunately they did not have
much. Then an idea struck me; that
there were two Americans in the
bunch, and they were officers of the
U. S. government and decided to hold
them for ransom. I told the Mexicans
that were with them to go away; and
made the Americans to follow us. We
took them to a little house in the hills,
and I made one of them write a note
to his government telling them to get
$5,000 for their release, then I tried
to converse and I told them that I
worked in Kansas and that I lost an
arm and a leg in an accident, but
they were so frightened that they
didn't even suspect that I lied. I
told them not to be afraid as nothing
would happen to them, because I was
sure the U. S. government wouldn't
refuse to give the money, but they
kept on trembling and saying that the
U. S. and Mexico were good friends, and
I told them that we Mexicans were
friends of the American money but
that we hated the people of the U. S.
Received in El Paso.
"When we got the money we knew
perfectly well somebody would try to
capture us and I told my friends to
come to the U. S. again and we recrossed
to the United States. Next day U. S.
troops crossed into Mexico. And we
went to El Paso and then we came to
Douglas, and about the time you will
be reading this letter we will be in
Bisbee. As we have got plenty of U. S.
money left.
"Please tell the readers of your
paper if you want to and if you are
not afraid. And tell the chief of po
lice that we will return to Douglas
pretty soon and that I give him in
surance to try and trap me. But that
he may rest assured it will cost the
lives of four or five of his gang to
capture one of us. Perhaps he thinks
this is only a bluff but that he may
be patient. As I hope to God I will
get a chance to show how much man
he is.
"Mr. Editor please excuse me as I
cannot write English pretty well be
cause I am not accustomed to do it
but I guess you will understand it all
right. Thanking you in advance I
remain your "friends."
"Jesus Rentería, Pablo Sanchez,
Manuel Gonzales, Timoteo Ruiz, Juan
Mendez.
"Note: In case that you should want
to know something relative to this
matter, ask it by medium of your
paper and I will answer it."
Officers here to whom the letter
was shown immediately upon its re
ceipt were of the opinion that it was
a fake, written by some Mexican wish
ing to have fun at their expense, but
all agree that it was written by a Mex
ican. However, a thorough investi
gation of the writer's claims is being
made through the border district.

BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL WIRE
El Paso, Tex., Aug. 29. "It seems
reasonable to expect that our neigh
bors, the Mexicans, should respect us
and, as the world war is over and
practically all of our combat divisions
are at home again, those in authority,
if they see fit, are well able to adopt

bring about favorable and happy re
sults," said Gen. Robert L. Howze,
who arrived here late today to as
sume command of the border, in
a written statement given the Asso
ciated Press.
"This policy should bring about
friendly relations and mutual un
derstanding with our friends, subjects of Great
Britain and France, who have vast pro

far as concerns Mexico in stabiliz

"We are living in a time too far

"Fortunately American military
matters on the border are in the

General Howze came direct

where he commanded the third

"I have been away from the El Paso
district a year and a day and away
from the Mexican border and its prob

added. "I am planning to make a
careful study of the entire situation
in the light of recent developments and
I intend to make myself familiar with
conditions here and on this border.
Further than that I have nothing
more to say regarding the Mexican
situation or the part the United States
will play in restoring peace in that
country."
GOVERNOR HOBBY URGES
INTERVENTION IN MEXICO
El Paso, Tex., Aug. 29. Intervention
in Mexico and the adoption of the
league of nations "to make the world
safe for American citizens" were
urged by Gov. W. P. Hobby of Texan
in a speech made tonight at a dinner
given in his honor by friends here.
This announcement was made in the
presence of Mexican Consul General
Andres G. Garcia and other Mexican
officials, who were guests at the din
ner. "Our glorious victory in the great
war has made the world safe for de
mocracy," Governor Hobby said. "Now
we must have intervention in Mexico
and a league of nations to assure that
safety to every place else in the world.
The lives and property of American
citizens should be protected in Mexi
co and all over the world.
"I glory that our nation had its big
share in bringing victory for the al
lied cause and that the men who wear
this uniform did so much to increase
the respect for our flag in foreign
lands. Now is the time for us to de
mand that proper respect be paid
American citizens all over the world,"
Governor Hobby concluded.
Maj. Gen. Robert L. Howze, newly
appointed commander of the El Paso
military district, and Brig. Gen. James
B. Irwin, retiring commander of the
district, were both given ovations
when they started speaking.
Supplementing his reference to Mex
ican intervention, delivered at a din
ner in his honor tonight, Governor
Hobby later tonight said:
"I believe that many Mexicans will
welcome intervention as a means of
establishing order in Mexico and of
protecting lives and property. In fact, I
have many Mexicans told me that
very thing. Intervention would make
it possible to do business in Mexico
and for Mexico to do business with
other countries, thus making it pos
sible for the people to earn a living.
When I say intervention, I mean
armed intervention."
Important Suit In Filed.
Santa Fe, Aug. 28. The American
Trust and Savings bank of Albuquer

court for Otero county against oil and
gas leases on lands which had been
