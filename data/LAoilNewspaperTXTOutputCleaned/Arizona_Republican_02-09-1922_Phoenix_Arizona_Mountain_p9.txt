JIMMY KRAMER SIGNS
Dilly Alger vs Jimmy Kramer; Chet
Neff vs. Jimmy Kramer; Chet Neff
vs. Billy Alger.
The fight fan who is looking for
something to worry about can dust
off the top story and get the old think
tank working.
One thing is certain Chet Neff and
Billy Alger are going to fight some
time this month.
But the fans must have a fight Mon
day night and the Legion match
maker is trying to get the first bout
off his chest. Both Neff and Alger
are in town ready to sign for their
next bout. Jimmy Kramer is on the
way, or will be this morning. Tickers
were wired Kramer yesterday and he
promised to leave Los Angeles last
night, which will put him in Phoenix
this morning. If he leaves Los An
geles today he will reach Phoenix to
morrow morning.
Jimmy is not coming down to loaf
around — he wants to fight and in or
der to fight he must eat and it takes
money to eat.
Either Alger or Neff will meet Kra
mer Monday night. The Legion
matchmaker will know definitely to
day. Alger has been suffering with
a slight wound on his forehead and
Monday's fight didn't help it any. His
physician advised him to lay off for
a week or so to give the wound a
chance to heal and Billy may follow
orders.
Neff has an out-of-town engagement
and if he takes the Monday bout with
Kramer it will necessitate cancelling
his other match.
Billy wants to go on regardless of
the doctor's orders and Neff says if
Alger cannot go on he will remain
here and fight Kramer Monday night
as he expects to be back for February
22 anyhow.
Kramer will be here and there will
be a card Monday night with either
Neff or Alger opposing Kramer. A
good preliminary card is being ar
ranged to start it off and if the fans
get as much action as they did last
Monday the Coliseum will be packed.
RED MILBURN WINS
Referee Jack O’Keefe stopped the
Red Milburn-Jack Lopez bout in the
third round at Miami Monday night.
Lopez was in a bad way and
O'Keefe stopped the scrap to save the
New Mexico boy from needless pun
ishment.
Milburn is the Douglas boxer local
promoters have been trying to match
with Young Mike.
The Miami Athletic club is trying to
arrange a match between Young Mike
and Milburn to be staged in the Con
centrator City two weeks from Tues
day.

MANY GOLFERS
TO HOLD BIG MEET

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Feb. 8—
“Barnyard golfers” from all parts of
America are trekking to the "Sun
shine City,” where the fourth annual
horseshoe pitching tournament for the
United States championship will be
held the week of Feb. 20 in the win
ter’s most unusual sport event.
At this early date a number of
the country’s best pitchers have al
ready arrived in St. Petersburg to
carry on their training for the big
meet which has attracted country
wide interest in past winters.
J. Todd Flower of Akron, O., presi
dent of the National League of Horse
shoe Pitchers, has arrived here to
take charge of the tourney, while Dr.
E. C. Beach, a retired minister of
Delaware, O., is already on the
ground to act as referee and manager
of the event.
Dr. F. M. Robinson, a star per
former of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., crossed
the country from California where he
had been sojourning to get into trim
for the contests and he was shortly
followed by Harry J. Bourne of At
lantic City, who finished fourth in
the meet last February.
The games will be played in the
center of a huge wooden bowl with
seating accommodations for 7,600
spectators. Five lanes will be laid out
on the level while the galleries will
be banked high into the air circling
the pit.
Cardinal Pitching
Star Had Sore Arm
Throughout Season
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 8—Bill Doak, who
led the National league pitchers last
season, suffered an injured liga
ment in his right elbow, pitching arm,
the entire season, it was learned to
day for the first time when officials
of the Cardinals received the signed
1922 contract. Doak wrote from his
home in Pittsburgh, Pa., that the trou
ble had been corrected and his arm
was in splendid condition.

Will Leon Goslin, Washington's re
cruit outfielder, emulate the deeds of
Sam Rice.
Goslin is expected to win a reg
ular place in the "Washington outfield
next season, alongside of Rice and
Milan.
Sam Rice came to the American
league as a pitcher. He had plenty
of stuff and seemed to have a great
chance to make good.
Lack of control was his worst
fault. In between pitching perform
ances, Rice showed that he could hit
and was fast on his feet.
George Dauss of the Detroit club
is a poor hitter. Dauss broke up a
ball game one day that had gone ex
tra innings. He hit one of Sam's
fast ones for three bases.
That wallop shaped Rice’s career.
He went to the dressing room and
announced that he was through as
a pitcher, that starting the next day
he became an outfielder.
Rice is today one of the most val
uable outfielders in the game. He
can do everything well.
Goslin, who made such a fine debut
as a big leaguer last fall, a home run
off Faber that broke up a ball game
being one of his best efforts, is fig
ured as a regular.
Ability to hit the old pill caused
him to shift to the outfield.
Goslin made his professional debut

Pawhuska Wins
Individual Cup
In Trap Tourney
KANSAS CITY, Feb. 8.—E. C.
Wheeler, Pawhuska, won the inter
state individual flyer cup in a shoot
off at the eighteenth annual inter
state trap shooting tournament today,
following a four-cornered tie. The
cup, won yesterday by E. B. Melrath,
Philadelphia, one of the challengers
of Fred Etchen, Coffeyville, Kan., for
mer holder of the cup, was redeemed
and placed in open competition again
today as the feature event on the
program.
Wheeler, C. C. Watts, Winfield,
Kan.; W. G. Warren, Yerrington,
Nev., and W. H. McCreary, La Junta,
Colo., tied for first place with a score
of 23. On the shootoff Wheeler
scored five straight, McCreary and
Warren scored four each and Watts
three.
In today’s 150-target race, E. B.
Renfroe, Butte, Mont., took high hon
ors with 142 broken targets. Frank
Troeh, Vancouver, Wash., tied with
three others for second place at 138.
W. G. Warren, Yerrington, Nev., tied

Stanislaus Zbyszko, world’s wres-

40 seconds with a double arm roll.

cago on March 27, 28, 29. The two
stars will meet in Orchestra Hall,
which has a seating capacity of 2000.
The match will be for 150 points,
played in blocks of 500 each night.
Lovers of the billiard game in the
east were hoping Schaefer would se
lect New York, but the champion was
loyal to Chicago.
Will Schaefer be able to repeat his
win over Hoppe and retain his title?
Was Hoppe's defeat due to the fact
that he did not take the recent tour
ney seriously enough?
Some of the experts insist Hoppe
played far below his game during
practically the entire tourney.
Others insist that Hoppe has gone
back, that he is no longer invincible.
They are positive Schaefer's victory
in the coming clash will be even more
pronounced.
There is no doubt but that Hoppe
is out to regain his title. If he did
not take the other meeting seriously
enough, he certainly is not overlook
ing a thing for the next meeting.
Ever since his defeat he has been
practicing constantly. It is said that
he is again at the top of his game.
When Hoppe was champion it was
a rarity for him to lose a match to
anyone in his exhibitions. Conti, the
French champion, has beaten Schae
fer in exhibitions since he won the
title.—B. E.

BEST AMERICAN
LEAGUE PLAYER
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8—The pro
posed player deal between the De
troit and New York clubs by which
the Yankees would obtain Outfielder
Veach in exchange for some infield
talent desired by the Tigers has been
abandoned. Manager Cobb of the De
troit club announced tonight after
the adjournment of the scheduled
meeting of the club owners of the
American league.
The Yankee owners, he said, de
clined to enter any proposition in
volving Shortstop Scott, and the De
troit club was unwilling to consider
any other players New York was
willing to give up for Veach. The
magnates were in session for three
hours, much of the time being spent
in discussing plans to effect a res
toration of the draft. No definite de
cision was reached. Whether there
shall be a joint meeting with the
National league, it was announced,
will be determined later if it develops
that the advisory council can not
amicably adjust the differences be
tween the majors and the five dis
senting minor leagues.
Aside from the presentation of the
playing dates for this year and the
adoption of a memorial to Benja
min F. Shibe, president of the Phil
adelphia club, who died recently, the
only action taken was in deciding to
make an award of a prize at the
end of each season.
“To the player who has been of
the greatest value to his team on
the basis of performances on the dia
mond and conduct off the field.”
This, it was explained, is a revival
of the Chalmers trophy idea, which
was discontinued about 10 years ago.
The cost of the emblem for the award
was fixed at $1,000. Playing man
agers will not be eligible for the
award.
The club owners were received at
the White House today by President
Harding.

MADISON, Wis., Feb. 8—An inves

four University of Wisconsin ath
letes had violated the Western con
ference concerning playing profes
sional baseball and basketball was
started today by the athletic coun
cil, but absolutely nothing to sub
stantiate the reports developed, ac
cording to T. E. Jones, athletic di
rector.
Today’s session was taken up large
ly with questioning by Rolie Wil
liams, halfback and football captain
elect, guard in basketball and base
ball outfielder. Rumors that Williams
had accepted money for playing in
Edgerton, Wis., were said by J. F. A.
Pyre, faculty representative on the
council to have proved baseless.
“Rowdy” Elliott, football halfback

football tackle, and Ralph Gill, sub
stitute quarterback, will be called be
fore the council, Mr. Jones an
nounced.

Financial and Market News

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market

NEW YORK, Feb. 8.—Operations
in the financial markets today were
overshadowed by the strength of In
ternational currencies. Practically
all important European exchanges
rose to highest prices in one to two
and a half years, again under lead of
British remittances.
Minor or speculative rails and a
few standard transportations fur
nished most of the activity and
strength shown by the stock market.
The general list was inclined to ease
from the outset and closed with a
heavy tone, coincident with call
money’s rise from 5 to 5½ per cent.
Low grade motors, cheaper oils,
food specialties and the chain store
group were the special targets of the
shorts, whose concerted attacks upon
those shares met with little opposi
tion.
Buying of rails was credited to a
group of local traders, their bullish
attitude apparently being based on
the better showing recently made by
many roads, especially grangers and
cotton carriers, these featuring the
day's movement.
Steels and equipments were listless
under the final hour, when Gulf States
Crucible, Republic and Midvale re
acted 1 to almost 3 points, with
Baldwin, Studebaker, Mexican Petro
leum, General Asphalt, Mercantile
Marine preferred and American In
ternational. Sales 775,000 shares.
Sterling demand bills sold a frac
tion above 4.38 before the close of
the market and the several allied ex
changes were 12 to 15 points higher.
Dutch, Danish and Swedish bills rose
8 to 22 points and the more remote
continental centers, including Spain
and Greece, moved upward 5 to 10
points.
Foreign bonds continued to ad
vance with the higher range of lead
ing exchanges. United Kingdoms of
1922 and 1929 made appreciable
gains and most French issues were
within easy range of last year’s best
prices.
The domestic bond market was ir
regular, convertible rails strength
ening with mixed gains and losses in
Liberty issues. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $14,250,000.
LIBERTY BONDS
NEW YORK, Feb. 8. Liberty

From the Chicago
Board of Trade

CHICAGO, Feb. 8.—Fear that the
domestic winter crop of wheat is per
haps in serious danger of curtailment
on a large scale led today to a steep
advance in values. Wheat closed un
settled, 2½ to 5 cents net higher,
with May at $1.30½ to $1.31 and July
$1.16½ to $1.16%. Corn gained ½
to ¾ to 1¼ cents, oats ½ to ¾ cent,
and provisions 5 to 15 cents.
News of dust and wind storms in
Kansas aroused apprehension among
wheat traders that the crop in that
state already at a disadvantage from
drought might suffer severely, and
the yield be greatly reduced as com
pared with the usual amount. The
secretary of the Kansas Grain Deal
ers’ association was quoted as saying
that 5,000,000 acres of wheat in
Kansas would not be harvested this
year, and that the condition of a
great deal of other wheat in the
state was critical. Excessive dryness
in western Oklahoma and Nebraska
added to misgivings, and in the last
half of the day far more than offset
price declines that earlier were
caused by downturns in quotations
at Liverpool and Buenos Aires. July
trade, which would be directly af
fected by crop damage, showed at
one time a bulge of 6%. Absence of
milling or export demand kept the
price of May delivery, however, with
in ordinary limits.
Corn and oats reflected in some
degree the rise of the wheat market,
but were restrained by much rural
selling of corn to arrive here. Be
sides shipping demand here was slow.
Provisions went higher in price on
account of the upward swing of the
grain and hog market.

Income Tax Facts
You Should Know
Series of Fifteen Articles Prepared
by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue of Informative
Value to Millions.

No. 10,
The tax on dividends is an important
item in the returns of many
payers.
A “dividend” for the purpose of the
income-tax law is any distribution in
cash or property made by a
corporation to its stockholders or
members (other than certain divi-
dends of a personal-service corpora-
tion) out of its earnings or profits
accumulated since February 28, 1913.
Dividends are taxable and are taxed
at the rates for the year in which
the cash is made available, regardless
of when the earnings or profits out
of which they were paid were accu-
mulated. Although interest on State
bonds and certain other obligations is
not taxable, when received by a corp
oration, upon amalgamation with
other funds of the corporation, and
distributed to stockholders in divi-
dends, it is taxable to the same ex-
tent as other dividends.
A dividend is income to the stock
holder as of the date when the cash
or property is unqualifiedly made
subject to his demand. Cash divi-
dends, while exempt from all nor-
mal tax, are taxable income to the in-
dividual recipient at the surtax rates
for the year in which received. Ac
cordingly, dividends must be included
as gross income, but they may be
deducted as a credit in computing
normal tax.
Stock Dividends
The revenue act of 1918 provided
for the taxation of stock dividends,
but since the enactment of that law
the Supreme Court of the United
States has held that stock dividends
do not constitute income within the
meaning of the sixteenth amendment
to the Constitution, and are accord-
ingly not subject to the income tax.
The revenue act of 1921 specifically
provides that such dividends shall not
be taxable when paid in good faith;
but that if, after the payment of such
a dividend, the corporation proceeds
to cancel or redeem its stock at such
time and in such manner as to make
the distribution and cancellation or
redemption essentially equivalent to
the distribution of a taxable dividend,
the amount received in redemption
or cancellation of the stock shall be
treated as a taxable dividend.
If a dividend is paid in the stock
of some other company, or some other
form of property, the fair value of the
property received is to be taken as
the value of the dividend paid, and
such amount is taxable to an individ
ual receiving it. A corporation may
deduct such amount from its gross
income.
Section 262, an entirely new pro
vision of the income tax law, places
citizens of the United States and do
mestic corporations whose chief in
come is from sources within Ameri
can possessions on a more equitable
basis in comparison with competing
aliens and foreign corporations.
Special provisions of the income tax
regulations deal with the taxation
and personal exemption of dividends
received from such corporations.
Dividends or interest received by
individuals during the years 1922 to
1926, inclusive, from domestic build
ing and loan associations, operated
exclusively for the purpose of mak
ing loans to members, are exempt
from both normal tax and surtax up
to $300.
