will be held this morning, Saturday,
and will consist of a prayer at the
home of the deceased's mother and
of other appropriate services at the
Methodist church. The house ser

at ten o'clock Rev. Fisk will conduct
the services from the church building. A great many friends of the de
ceased will attend to pay a last tri
bute. The local high school students
have prepared special tokens of
sorrow and will attend almost in a
body. The deceased was, up to the
early part of November, a student
of the high and one of their most
beloved members.
The Ladies of the Maccabees will
attend the church services in a body.
The body will be placed to rest in
the Double Butte cemetery and with

most highly esteemed and most pop
ular young men of the valley.

ANOTHER ORANGE BELT
LOCATED NEAR MESA
Contract Signed for Setting Out 4000
Washington Navels on Highest
Irrigated Spot Under Project
A contract was signed yesterday
whereby Paul Baxter Seville, of the
Mesa City Nursery on next Tuesday
will commence the transplanting of
4000 Washington navel orange trees
from his local nursery to the ranch
of W. A. Tway located about eight
miles northeast of Mesa and under
the first lateral out of the Eastern
canal. The land owned by Mr.
Tway has the distinction of being
the highest land in point of altitude
above sea level of any tract under
the Roosevelt project. However,
aside from having geographical dis
tinction it has certain other qualifi
cations which in the minds of the
gentlemen interested in putting out
the trees, amounts to much more.
The tract is near the foothills and
is also adjacent to the desert. Those
are two features which are probably
responsible for its temperature and
peculiar conditions existing through
out that section during the winter
months. Sunflowers bloomed through
out the year. Ripe tomatoes were
picked in November, December and
January. Cotton never ceased send
ing out its blossoms and with the
beginning of the spring months the
young trees continue sending out
their blossoms considerably in ad
vance of the cotton plants on the
higher ground which are just com
ing through the soil. It is this very
feature of an extraordinary condi
tion, an extraordinary protection of
some kind prohibiting cold weather
that determined the gentlemen to
set out an orchard of the finest or
ange trees to be found in the nursery.
There is only a small amount of
the land in the upper Lehi valley
that is so fortunately located. How
ever, the entire valley is much freer
from the cold than is the mesa land
to the south.
The outcome of the orchard will
be watched with a great deal of in
terest. In the event that the trees
are brought to bearing without dif
ficulty it will mean that the real or
ange belt of the valley has been dis
covered in the upper Lehi valley.
CHRISTIAN CHURCH PICNIC
Two Hundred and Fifty People En
joy Bonfire Party on Desert and By
the Governor Address
One of the most enjoyable picnics
of the season was that of Thursday
evening when twenty-five automobiles
lined up along the Christian church
and at 6:30 o'clock loaded with mem
bers of the Christian church Sunday
school and friends of the school began
the trip to the desert with the large
state car occupied by Governor Hunt
and party in the lead. The picnic
was held a half mile east of the
Eastern canal on the desert and di
rectly east of the Chas. Pine ranch
about eight miles southeast of Mesa.
When the jolly crowd of picnickers
arrived, the committee made up of a
large number of the desert home
steaders were on hand with a large
bonfire which lit up the sky and
marked the place for the holding of
the picnic.
A program was given consisting of
the singing of a number of patriotic
songs followed by a reading by R. R.
Hardin. Governor Hunt gave one of
his characteristic addresses. He
touched upon politics but slightly and
that in defense of his policy of tax
ing the corporations. He would
probably never have had a more re
sponsive audience to have mentioned
his anti-capital punishment measure,
but this he did not do. His remarks
dealt principally with democracy,
not in the true partisan sense but
rather along the lines of the true
west. He gave the homesteaders,
many of whom were present, words
of encouragement and complimented
them upon their perseverance. In
closing he paid a glowing tribute to
the citizenship of the state, which
was roundly applauded.
Following the program was one of
the features of the occasion: a
wienerwurst roast. With the wiener-
wursts were served coffee, pickles,
sandwiches, apples, bananas and or
anges. The crowd, made hungry by
the long ride and the exhilarating
desert air, made attack after attack
on the food supply, but it withstood
the onslaught and there was some
left when the last guest was ready
to depart for home, satisfied and
sure that every one had had one
glorious time.
VISITING FRIENDS
M. J. Norton is in the city from
Phoenix for a visit with the L. E.
Holcombs. Mr. Norton is a teacher
and it is understood expects to be
come an applicant for a position in
the Mesa schools.
PIONEER PASSES AWAY
Mrs. Sarah M. Mullen, wife of
Fred Mullen, aged 63 years, died at
11 o'clock yesterday morning at her
home immediately west of the city,
from a lingering illness extending
over a year. For the past three days
the end has been expected at any
moment and her son, William, and a
daughter, Mrs. Davis, were called
from Douglas to be at her bedside.
The funeral services will be held this
morning from the Alma ward church
at 10 o'clock, under the direction of
Noah W. Brimhall, first counsellor
to the bishop. Interment will take
place in the Mesa cemetery.
The deceased is survived by a
husband and five children: Mrs. Ed
gar Hunsaker, Mrs. Davis of Douglas,
William Mullen of Douglas, and Jess
and Hart Mullen, of this city. Thirty-three
years ago Mrs. Mullen came
to this city from Utah and she has
continued to make it her home. She
joined the Latter Day Saints' faith
early in life and clung tenaciously
to its tenets throughout her life.

HUNTING WHAT?

near the window of a crowd of cus

he's hunting?" "Carolina," the other
answered. Odd Fellow.
