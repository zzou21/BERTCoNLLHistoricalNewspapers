COL. THOMAS FITCH
Came Over From Tucson
for the Sole Purpose of
Taking His First Ride
Back to California Via
the A. & C.


REAL ESTATE TRANSFERS,
As reported by the Arizona Ab
stract & Title Co., 134 West
Washington Street.

Col. Thomas Fitch of Los Angeles
lawyer and literateur and pioneer of a
dozen states, spent yesterday in Phoe
nix. He came here just because, but
more particularly to go away again.

He went to Yuma and Tucson because
he had to, having some legal business
to attend to in those towns in the pre
paration of a case for the supreme
court. And finding himself in Tucson
with his work finished, he decided he
would add a little pleasure to his busi
ness trip and call on his old friend
Phoenix, returning to Los Angeles via
the Arizona & California railway, over
which he had never yet had the pleas
ure of traveling. He spent part of the
day looking over the city which has
been his home at intervals for the last
thirty or forty years, and put in the
rest of it fanning himself at the Hotel
Adams and giving out entertaining in
terviews to the newspaper reporters.
He told one afternoon paper the usu
al story about his probably coming
back here to locate or at least he was
so quoted. He told the same story to
The Republican reporter, except that
he added that before he came it would
have to be a darn sight cooler than it
was yesterday. He was not surprised,
however, for he has lived here many
summers off and on and had a good
working knowledge of the climate.
Asked if he ‘did not rejoice’ in the
achievement of statehood the colonel
said he did and that he gloried in the
part he had played in securing it. He
said he “stayed here twenty years wait
ing for it and preaching and praying
for it but seeing the people were de
termined not to get it as long as he
stuck around, he moved away and then
they got it.” He feels now that it was
well worth the sacrifice he made.

Mr. Fitch is best known as the Silv
er Tongued orator of the coast, a title
that was accorded him many, many
years ago, when the art of saying
things in beautiful metaphor and well
rounded figures was not so desper
ately overworked as it is these days.
Long before the boy orator of the Platte
began juggling with crowns of thorns
and crosses of gold, and before the
soap box eloquence of the I. W. W. had
stagnated traffic in the populous cen
ters and thrown the police reserves in
to panic. In those days oratory was
used for two purposes by Mr. Fitch,
one was to head the pleasure-loving
youth of the community in the paths
of rectitude and the other was to make
them vote the ticket straight. Generally
it was the republican ticket when Mr.
Fitch had anything to do with it and
though one would hardly think so from
the present political aspect hereabout,
it is true that in those days a republican
was a curiosity in Arizona. Occasional
ly there would be a crop of oratory, the
writer remembers having coughed up
a dollar once to hear Col. Fitch say a
lot of fine things about music. It was
in a little brick church that used to
stand on the present site of the old
Hotel Dennis. Especially as most of it
went to the melodies. The lecture was
well worth the money. The colonel took
his audience through all the sympho
nies and then suddenly jumped to the
Messiah. When he finished he left them
all singing together in a chorus the
melody of which has never been for
gotten.

The whole country west of the Rock
ies is seeded down to anecdotes con
cerning Col. Fitch, the things he has
done and the things he tried to do. One
Phoenix reminiscence is worth repeat
ing for the benefit of those who find
the monthly electric light bill a con
stantly recurring nuisance. The colonel
and his wife at that time made
Phoenix their home and one summer
they went to Europe. When they re
turned the electric light company pre
sented a bill that staggered him. After
exhausting his linguistic resources in
expostulation and condemnation of the
Western employee, the colonel
took a look around and in an inner
wardrobe he discovered an electric light
that had been working day and night
all summer long, spending money on
this side of the world about as fast as
he could slough it off while hobnobbing
with kings and potentates on the other
side. And too, all that happened in the
old days before the rates were reduced.

About the only thing that seemed to
worry Col. Fitch yesterday was his
doubt about what is to transpire in
Chicago on the 18th. He is too good a
republican to think that any possible
candidate will bolt the convention or
that any possible democrat can be bet
ter than the most impossible republi
can. But also, he is too careful a man
to say who he thinks will be nominat
ed. Though Col. Fitch has been a very
successful lawyer he has always had
a penchant for using his pen and in his
days has turned out a few novels and
many shorter stories both fiction and
reminiscence, while he has incidentally
devoted some time to moulding public
opinion through the agency of the edi
torial column. He says he is still em
ploying himself in all those vocations,
doing what most appeals to him at the
time, but keeping up his law practice to
an extent, looking especially after the
interests of his older clients.


YALE ALUMNI ASKED TO CON
TRIBUTE $750,000 TO BUILD
GREAT ATHLETIC
CENTRE.

Plans for the construction of a
Yale coliseum to seat approximately
sixty thousand persons at the football
and other athletic contests between
Yale, Princeton and Harvard, and for
the building of lawn tennis and
squash courts, base ball diamonds,
football gridirons and other fields for
outdoor sports sufficient to afford
accommodation for some two thousand
Yale undergraduates will be announc
ed tomorrow by “Yale Alumni Week
ly.” A copy of the report of the com
mittee of twenty-one will be sent to
every Yale man.

Besides the features already men
tioned, a new baseball stand seating
about twenty-five thousand and a
modern club house will be erected.
The total expense is estimated at
$750,000, of this amount the coliseum
will cost $350,000, the eighty-five
acres of land opposite the present
Yale field necessary for the new pro
ject about $125,000, the clubhouse
about $150,000 and the new base
ball land on the field about $50,000.
The rest of the sum will be spent
in general development of the
grounds.

Since March, 1911, various commit
tees have been considering the en
tire proposition, and the general re
sult of their conclusions was that
Yale needed first of all a general
athletic field sufficient for the entire
university to exercise upon.
Secondly the increasing attendance
at Yale’s great football games re
sulted in the exclusion of so many
Yale graduates that it was necessary
to provide fuller accommodations. Fi
nally there was need of fireproof and
permanent stands to replace the pre
sent wooden stands and lessen the
present cost of repairing which
amounts to $12,000 a year.

After considerable investigation the
committee decided that a coliseum
was much to be preferred over a
stadium. Plans and specifications
will be asked of several architects at
once, but it is certain that the col
iseum will be elliptical, and probably
have movable sections of seats. The
arena, or playing field itself, will be
sunk below the ground level, and the
coliseum will have twenty-five rows
of seats below ground level and thir
ty rows above. It will probably be
in the form of an embankment of
earth faced with concrete, upon which
will be placed wooden seats and
iron foot rests. A broad footway
will run around the top of the col
iseum, accommodating many more
spectators. The top row of seats will
be about thirty feet above normal
ground level.

The baseball stands will be erected
on the present football field. The
clubhouse will have every modern
convenience.
To finance the scheme it is de
cided to sell to graduates, non-grad
uates, undergraduates and benefactors
of Yale certificates varying from
$10 to $1,000, the only dividend or
privilege connected with them being
the right to apply for from two to
ten tickets at regular prices for all
games in the coliseum for fifteen
years from the date the coliseum is
erected. This will give the holders
of such certificates only the right to
have their applications for seats filled
before all others. It is expected, as
has already been done in one case,
that several graduates will give
money for various fields in the way
of memorials. Part of the fund will
be paid out of revenues to be re
ceived from the new fields.
The general plans as stated have
been accepted and approved by the
Yale corporation, and tomorrow the
actual canvass of Yale men for funds
will begin. The committee says that
funds must be available immediately,
in order to begin work, but feels
certain its appeal will be eagerly
met. As the contract of subscription
will expire on December 31, 1917, it
is evident that the committee ex
pects the coliseum to be soon avail
able to entitle the holders to their
fifteen years’ privileges.

OLD ENGLISH EXECUTIONS

Breakfast for the Guests Invited to
See the Hanging.

Executions, when criminals were
hanged in the Old Bailey in London,
had certain customary sequels. The
governor of Newgate, for instance, al
ways gave a breakfast to those
guests he had invited to see the
hanging, and by established custom
devilled kidneys always formed the
principal dish, although, as John
Hollingshead has related, nearly eve
ry one was obliged to swallow a
glass of brandy first.

Another function described in “Lon
don in the Sixties” was the reception
held afterward by the hangman at the
Green Dragon, in Fleet street, where
he took refreshment with his admirers
and sold the fatal rope on the scale of
sixpence per inch.

In the good old times nearly every
criminal who was executed was
credited with a confession and “last
dying words,” whether he uttered
them or not. According to Cassell’s
“Old and New London,” these were
printed in Holborn by a certain Mr.
Cave, and by Mr. Cauthack of Seven
Dials. And sometimes an offender was
persuaded to buy the pleasure, Lord
George Gordon, for example, had a
copy of his “last speech and dying
words” printed and published for him
self, and had the pleasure, Lord George
Gordon, of reading his own obituary.

Many of these broadsides, printed
on a peculiar whitey-brown paper,
may still be seen in the neighborhood
of the Old Bailey, in the little quaint
shops that seem to have descended in
the women’s children’s toys, and
sweets alongside of relics of crimes in
the walls. One case shows a rope
with a label explaining that it was
used to hang a certain notorious crim
inal. It is provided with a certificate
of authenticity signed by the governor
of Newgate.  

An execution which never came off
also had its curious episode. Dennis
Dunn, the hangman, who was sen
tenced to death but afterward par
doned, actually put on the black
robe before starting for the scaffold,
whereupon the sheriff of London pre
sented him with ten guineas “as a tes
timony to his excellent mode of per
forming business.” Dennis
found this robe not only inconvenient
when at work but rather conspicuous
at other times, so he sold it to old
Cane, a well known charlatan of the
day. Decked in the hangman’s robe
and a pasteboard crown the fortune
teller cut an imposing figure.

The royal crown of Persia, which
dates back to remote ages, is in the
form of a pot of flowers, surmounted
by an uncut ruby the size of a hen’s
egg.
