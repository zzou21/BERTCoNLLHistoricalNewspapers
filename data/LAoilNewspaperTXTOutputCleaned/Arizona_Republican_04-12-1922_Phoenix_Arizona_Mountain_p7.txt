FINANCIAL AND MARKET NEWS

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market
[Republican A. P. Leased Wire]
NEW YORK, April 11.—Quoted
values in the stock market registered
additional substantial gains today in
another large turnover, sales amount
ing to 1,400,000 shares.
Steels, motors and their specialties,
oils and utilities, again were conspic
uous in the day’s operations, at ex
treme gains of one to five points.
New high records for the year
were made by Studebaker and sev
eral affiliated issues, as well as Mex
ican Petroleum and many unclassi
fied specialties, coppers, tobaccos
and textiles.
United States Steel failed to equal
its maximum of the previous day but
was in fair demand, and buying of
metals was stimulated by further
larger exports of copper.
As a group, rails were sluggish but
exceptions were made by Rock
Island, presumably in connection
with that road’s good showing in the
preliminary report for last year. Chi
cago Great Western, preferred, also
displayed unusual strength, but coal
ers eased on the heavy tone of Read
ing.
Fractional losses in Bethlehem,
Crucible and Gulf States Steels, and
Baldwin Locomotive at the close
were neutralized by net gains of one
to five points in Studebaker, Mexi
can Petroleum, Royal Dutch, Pacific
Oil, Utah, American Smelting, Com
puting Tabulating and Stromberg
Carburetor.
Heavy inflow of funds from in
terior banks accounted for relaxed
money rates, call loans easing from
4% to 4 per cent in the last half of
the session. Time money rates were
unaltered but in more liberal supply
for short dates.
Brokers reported only a moderate
amount of trading in foreign ex
change. British and the leading con
tinental rates were mainly lower, but
Dutch and German bills displayed
pronounced strength and the Greek
rates were not unfavorably influenced
by reports which confirmed recent
advices of disturbing economic con
ditions in that country.
CHICAGO BOARD
CHICAGO, April 11.—Wheat de
clined in price today largely as a re
sult of downward tendency of Liver
pool quotations and weakness of
foreign exchange. The close
settled % to 2c net lower, with May
1.31% to 1.31%, and July 1.20 to
1.20%. Corn finished unchanged to

The off oats unchanged to %c down,
and provisions unchanged to a set
back of 20 cents.
It had been expected by many
wheat traders that in view of yester
day's advance in values on this side
of the Atlantic the Liverpool market
this morning would show an upturn.
Disappointment in this respect was
emphasized particularly by a decline
in sterling and by advices of dis
turbed financial conditions in Greece.
Besides, export demand was slow,
and the view was pressed that all
known bullish factors had been fully
discounted for the present.
Better milling demand at St. Louis,
Kansas City and Omaha helped
somewhat at one stage to rally the
wheat market here, but toward the
end of the day a renewal of weak
ness became evident owing more or
less to gossip that two Minneapolis
mills were offering to sell in Chicago
hard winter wheat which had been
purchased in the southwest. Selling
of 100,000 bushels here to go to store
was also a late depressing factor,
especially as to the May delivery.
Unfavorable crop reports from parts
of Kansas were virtually ignored.
Persistent rainy weather made the
market for corn and for oats rela
tively steady. Business, however,
lacked volume.
Provisions as a rule were lower in
line with hogs and on account of in
creasing stocks of lard.

not interfere with the program and
it was completed as advertised.
The Scottsdale Blues won their
fourteenth victory yesterday and
their first conference game when
they defeated the Ford Garage team
of Phoenix 7 to 6 in a fast game on
the local diamond. The high wind
made safe playing impossible but
not many errors were made. A good
size crowd attended the game, thus
showing the home team that they
have the backing of the people of
the district.
J. E. Kinney left for Columbus,
Ohio, yesterday for an extended stay.
Mrs. Kinney and the children will
remain here until school is out so

but it destroyed some tomatoes that
many of the vegetable growers had
set out.
The black aphis is doing consider
able damage to the young growth
on the young citrus trees but they
can be destroyed by using the Black
Leaf "40" spray with whale oil soap.
Soft water should be used in the
spray solution for the hard water

properly. Information on how to mix
and use the spray will be given by
your high school agricultural in

BRAVED BY WOMAN
Mrs. A. R. Robinson, who is now
living in Phoenix, is a pioneer of Ar
izona who has suffered hardships
in her early life such as few wom
en are called upon to endure. She did
the work of a man in establishing
the family home in this state and
helped her husband build their first
log cabin at Show Low, near Snow
flake.
When Mr. and Mrs. Robinson came
to Arizona from Utah in 1875, Mrs.
Robinson drove the team and at
tended to the harnessing and unhar
nessing of the horses while her hus
band was in charge of a herd of cat
tle. They settled at Show Low and
lived there for 10 years when Mr.
Robinson was murdered by Apaches.
His body was mutilated and thrown
into a waterhole. Mrs. Robinson then
left the ranch with her small chil
dren, never to see it again, and went
to Snowflake.
A short time later she returned to
Utah on a visit and returned to Ar
izona later. Fifteen years ago she
moved to Phoenix.
Mrs. Robinson, in spite of the hard
life she led, raised a family of chil
dren and provided for them until
they grew up. Eight of her children
are still living in different parts of
the state.

VOLUNTEERS THEN
TALK OF IMPROVING
DEPT. IN GLENDALE
GLENDALE, April 11.—A special
meeting of the Glendale volunteer
fire department was held last night
at the building in the municipal park.
The purpose of this meeting was to
discuss the ways and means of pro
viding better fire protection methods
within the town of Glendale. Heretofore Glendale has had unusual suc
cess in controlling fires through its
volunteer organization; but during
the last year, the members of the
department have fallen away and
at the present time about all that
are left is the chief and two men. The
local commercial club has become in
terested in the organization and
through their efforts interest has
been revived and this meeting was
to bring about a complete reorgani
zation.
The meeting was not so well at
tended as was hoped but those pres
ent went ahead and acted in order
to get the department under way.
A committee was appointed consisting
of P. J. White, George Hull and
Holly Betts to draw up by-laws and
report back at the next meeting,
Monday night.
Woman’s Club
The Glendale Woman’s club will
hold its library anniversary meeting
this afternoon at the club house. This
meeting will be in commemoration of
the third anniversary of the estab
lishment of the library. Each lady is
asked to come in some costume sug
gesting the title of a book and for
the best costume a prize will be
given. A splendid program has been
arranged and will be in charge of
Mrs. A. A. Carrick. All ladies of the
town are invited and the meeting will
be an open one. Those who wish,
may bring a present to the meeting
which will be given toward adding to
the library. A book would be very
appropriate.
Dance to Be Given
Glendale young people have gotten
together and will give a dance Thurs
day night at the Woman's club. Good
music will be provided and those who
attend will be assured of a good
time.
Boy Scout Activities
Troop No. 1 of the Boy Scouts will
be hosts this evening to Mr. Murray,
state Scout Executive, who will be in
Glendale for the purpose of talking
to the troop on various works of the
patrols. Earl Grassie will hold the
place of honor tonight when he re
ceives his badge which entitles him
to the honor of being a First Class
Scout. Earl is the first boy in Glen
dale to take all his work from a
Tenderfoot to a First Class Scout
and attain such a high degree of pro
ficiency.
Woman's Missionary Society
The Woman’s Missionary society
of the Christian church will meet at
the home of Mrs. Harry More Thurs
day for an all-day meeting. A very
pleasant time is anticipated and sev
eral very interesting guests will be
present from neighboring towns.
Children’s Party
The children’s Easter party which
will be held Saturday afternoon in
the municipal park will be one big,
grand event in the children’s minds.
Games of all kinds will be indulged
in and the kiddies are assured of lots
of fun and plenty of refreshments.
This party is also being given in
commemoration of the third anni
versary of the founding of the pub
lic library. A small sum of ten cents
will be charged to help defray ex
penses of the party and that which is
left over will be used to place ju
venile books in the library for the
children to read. Many have contrib
uted eggs to be used for the party and
those wishing to give more are asked
to communicate with Mr. Warren at
phone 183. All those who wish to
have a certain book placed in the
library are asked to present the
name of the book to the Woman’s
club and the club will do their best
to see it is procured.
Easter Services
Special Easter services will be held
next Sunday morning at the opening
of Sunday school at the Christian
church.
Attend Party
The party given at the Mexican
Mission by Rev. Vargas was well at
tended, there being about 75 persons
in all present. A good time was en

BRAVED BY WOMAN
Mrs. A. R. Robinson, who is now
living in Phoenix, is a pioneer of Ar
izona who has suffered hardships
in her early life such as few women
are called upon to endure. She did
the work of a man in establishing
the family home in this state and
helped her husband build their first
log cabin at Show Low, near Snow
flake.

When Mr. and Mrs. Robinson came
to Arizona from Utah in 1875, Mrs.
Robinson drove the team and at
tended to the harnessing and unhar
nessing of the horses while her hus
band was in charge of a herd of cat
tle. They settled at Show Low and
lived there for 10 years when Mr.
Robinson was murdered by Apaches.
His body was mutilated and thrown
into a waterhole. Mrs. Robinson then
left the ranch with her small chil
dren, never to see it again, and went
to Snowflake.

A short time later she returned to
Utah on a visit and returned to Ar
izona later. Fifteen years ago she
moved to Phoenix.

Mrs. Robinson, in spite of the hard
life she led, raised a family of chil
dren and provided for them until
they grew up. Eight of her children
are still living in different parts of
the state.
