Sacks Win on Walks.
SACRAMENTO, May 21. Willie Mc
Corry kept the ball far from the plate today so the Sacramentoto Wolves could make only four hits. Only two of those figured in the scoring—but thanks to ten walked batters the locals put over four runs which proved just one more than San Francisco could score on six hits. The local errors figured in all the Wolves scores; McCorry's walks triggered in all but one of the Wolves' runs. Stroud fanned ten visitors.

Spider Baum Wins for Tigers.
LOS ANGELES, May 21. Spider
Baum had the better of a pitching bat
tle with Erve Higginbotham today and
Venice won the second game of the
series with Portland 2 to 1. Baum
kept the Beavers' hits scattered ex
cept in the fifth, when McCormick
doubled, and took third on Fisher's
base hit and scored on Higginbotham's infield out. A triple by Hosp and a single by Tonneman en
abled the Tigers to tie the score in the
seventh. O'Rourke brought in the win
ning hit to right which would have been
good for three bases. O'Rourke, Hosp
and Carlisle made sensational plays.
Patterson was thrown out of the game
by umpire Finney for protesting a de
cision in the sixth.

Tigers get Drucke.
LOS ANGELES, May 21. Louis
Drucke, formerly on the pitching staff
of the New York Giants and more rec
ently with Sacramento, was signed to
day by Manager Hogan of the Venice
Coast League team. Drucke was re
leased by Manager Wolverton who was
obliged to cut down his team to the
playing limit.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 21. A
double, a single, a steal, a wild throw and
a home run by Coy, all in the first in
ning, netted four runs for Oakland to
day and virtually won the game from
Los Angeles.
"Dolly" Gray was given a chance to
come back but after he had been hit
freely for five innings, Manager Mitz
sent Ohnstead in to relieve him. In
the fifth Ness scored his second home
run of the day.

There is a growing suspicion in the
American League that Carl Weilman
is some pitcher. He has started out in
mid-season form and is St. Louis' win
ning boxman.
Weilman's rise to fame has been
sudden. From obscurity in the Blue
Grass League he became recognized
as one of the leading left-handers in
the game.
Carl also has other claims to fame,
as he is the tallest pitcher in the
majors. He started in the game at
first base, because of his wonderful
reach, but he always had an ambition
to pitch.

The Little Rifles Big in Quality

You are going to buy a .22 calibre
rifle, single shot or repeater you'll
find that many well known crack
shots started with a Remington .22.
Their advice now would be "By all means,
get a Remington" because they know that there
is a tendency in some quarters to look upon these
models as only "a small boy's rifle" and to cheapen
them so that they can be sold at a price.
You have just as much right to expect full
shooting value in your .22 calibre arm as in your
$75 big game rifle.
You want the Remington single shot at
from $3 to $6, .22, .25-20 or .32 calibre, made
by the same people who make the famous
Remington Autoloading Rifles.
Or, if you prefer the repeating rifle, the
Remington slide action .22 repeater—with
its easy take-down and special safety fea
tures, shooting .22 short, .22 long or .22 long
rifle cartridges, at $10 and up, is your arm.
Sold by live dealers of this community the
most popular small calibre rifles in America.

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
CARDIFF, May 21. British Cabin
et ministers are exposed to such
risks as being mauled by the mili
tants at public meetings that here
after it is likely they will refuse to
attend unless those in charge of the
meetings are prepared to guarantee
their personal safety. Because such
assurance could not be given the
Home Secretary, the Right Honorable
Reginald McKenna, he did not appear at
the Welsh disestablishment and free
church conference today, although he
was announced as one of the speak
ers. It is understood the authori
ties learned of a suffragette plot to
attack the secretary by methods which
would not only jeopardize McKen
na's life, but the lives of the dele
gates.

All you have to do is to ask for Schlitz
in Brown Bottles.
Sunlight grows hops, but spoils the beer.
"Beer acted upon by light soon takes up
the very disagreeable, so-called 'light
taste,' and also a repulsive, skunk-like odor,"
says no less an authority than the Wahl-Henius Institute
of Fermentology, the scientific authorities on
the subject. If beer so affected they say, "is
offensive to the palate of most consumers."
Light starts decay even in pure beer. Dark glass
gives the best protection against light. The Brown
Bottle protects Schlitz purity from the brewery to
your glass.
Why don't you, too, drink Schlitz? More and
more people every year are demanding it.
We started in a hut. Today our agencies
dot the earth. Our output exceeds a million
barrels a year. For sale at the following hotels and bars:

SCORLESS PITCHING NEW WRINKLE IN BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL;
FANS ALL AGOG AS JOHNSON AND MATHEWSON RACE FOR RECORD

Left to right: Doc White, Walter Johnson, Jack Coombs (bottom) and Christy Mathewson.
Scoreless pitching is the new wrinkle in the major leagues this year. The fanning public stands agog
at the superhuman efforts of leading sluggists to establish records for the number of innings they can go
without allowing the opposition club to register a run.
In the American League Walter Johnson with 56 scoreless innings has made the record of the year.
In the National League Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants is in the lead.
Jack Coombs set the scoreless inning record in 1910, when he went 53 rounds without letting a run
over. In 1904 Doc White of Chicago traveled 48 runless innings. This mark stood for six years.
