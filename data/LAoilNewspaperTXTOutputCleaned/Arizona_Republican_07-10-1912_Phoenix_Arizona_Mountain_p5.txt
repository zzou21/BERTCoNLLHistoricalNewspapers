MERE MEMORY

Arizona being the birthplace of
many corporations, it is the meeting
place of hundreds of boards of di
rectors and lists of stockholders in
person or by proxy,—generally by
proxy, of which the public at large
never hears. But that there was a
meeting of the directors of the Amer
ican Differential Axle company yes
terday which was announced in a
rather striking manner in Justice
Johnstone’s court where the leader
of the minority stockholders, O. M.
Payne, had caused Thomas Box of
New York, the promoter of the com
pany and the controller of the ma
jority of the stock, to be haled for an
assault.
The testimony at the trial included
some glimpses of the affairs of the
company. It appeared that there
were none of the stockholders of the
company present yesterday except Mr.
Box and Mr. Payne. The meeting
took place in the office of Walter
Milligan in the National Bank of Ari
zona building. Mr. Milligan is an
agent of the company.
Mr. Box had just received a tele
gram from New York requesting the
election of two men as members of
the directory. He showed the tele
gram to Mr. Payne who said he had
no objection to their election but he
added that he wanted men who would
see that there was no more of this

monkey business with the affairs of
the company.
Since Mr. Box had been solely di
recting those affairs he regarded that
remark as to some extent personal,
and he remarked in an impersonal
way that any man who said that he
had acted dishonestly was a liar.
Mr. Payne asked Mr. Box if he
would go down to the street and say
that. Mr. Box replied that he would
and he asked in turn whether Mr.
Payne would go down to the street
to hear him say it. The invitation
being mutual both started toward the
door, Mr. Box in front. What hap
pened after that constituted the sub
ject of controversy.
Mr. Payne said that Mr. Box in
stead of going out of the door ob
structed the exit and slammed away
at him three times. He showed some
slight scratches on the right side of
his face which he said was the re
sult of the blows. Then, he said in
self defense he struck Mr. Box once.
Mr. Box took the stand and said
that for a long time Mr. Payne as
leader of the minority had been an
tagonistic to him, had insulted him
on various occasions once in the
presence of a lady and had occasion
ed him eleven trips across the con
tinent. He had also been the means
of getting something like three and
a half million shares of the stock
away from him.
As to the immediate contention he
said that he started out of the door
of Mr. Milligan’s office on the invi
tation of Mr. Payne and when near
the door the latter struck him. He
threw his arm up and outward and
his open hand had probably struck
the face of Mr. Payne.
This testimony was corroborated by
Mr. Milligan and in part by Attorney
Linney whose office was adjoining
though the latter had not seen the
actual encounter. Finally the whole
matter was simmered down to the
question whether Mr. Box had struck
Mr. Payne at all or whether the con
tact of his open hand with Mr.
Payne’s face was not largely acci
dental. Mr. Box said that he could
not have struck Payne in the posi
tion in which both were standing. By
this time both gentlemen were stand
ing side by side in the court room
and in apparent good humor each
was trying to show the court that

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
WASHINGTON, July 9. The
scheme of the republican progressives
in the house of representatives to
launch a fresh campaign against
President Taft by means of a peti
tion asking him to withdraw as the
republican nominee proved a flash in
the pan today. When pinned down,
the members who had participated
in the conferences which developed
the idea hastily joined the “don’t
mention my name” club. Only one
of the participants in the informal
conferences, Representative Rolin R.
Rees of Kansas admitted that he had
the petition aimed at Taft and he
made it public coupled with a state
ment which said in part: “My scheme
was to appeal to Taft’s patriotism
and his well known love for party
solidity.”
The petition had not been signed
by the insurgents. They have con
cluded to hold another conference
when there are more insurgent lead
ers in Washington.
o
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
IN OIL LAND CASE

Statement of S. P. Attorney Regarding
a Telephone Conversation.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
SAN FRANCISCO, July 9. A mys
terious woman in black, seeking black
mail was brought into the testimony
taken today in the suit of the United
States to recover from the Southern
Pacific, oil lands valued at $150,000,000.
Chas. Leavers, attorney for the com
pany made a direct charge that Thos.
J. Griffin, of Los Angeles an engineer
and oil expert and the most valuable
witness produced thus far by the gov
ernment had called him up by tele
phone under the name of “Franklin”
shortly before giving his testimony to
say that “Mrs. Brown would call on
him today regarding the case.” “That
the man who called me up by telephone
was that man” pointing to Griffin, “and
that he recognized his voice the mo
ment he took the stand.” Griffin de
nied knowing any “Mrs. Brown” and
averred that he had not talked with
any woman about the case.
o
Frederic S. Isham studied at first
hand a few of the thrills experienced
by his hero in “A Man and His Mon
ey.” Mr. Isham, who was once a
newspaper reporter, covered an as
signment which was extremely dan
gerous, and after getting in some
close pinches, concluded that he knew
what “hair-raising” meant.
the other was mistaken as to his re
collection of the incident. The feeling
between them did not seem to be bit
ter and each disclaimed having any
hostile sentiment toward the other.
Mr. Box before the beginning of the
trial had asked Mr. Payne if he would
go out and get a drink. Mr. Payne
being from the moral city of Los An
geles is perhaps a teetotaler; anyway
he was not thirsty. Justice Johnstone
could not find in the evidence that
a serious assault had been committed.

ASKS FOR BIDS—The Arizona fair
commission, by C. B. Wood the secre
tary, has asked for bids for the con
struction of a south extension to the
present grandstand at the fair grounds.
Blue prints and all necessary data are
on file at the office of the secretary
who will receive bids until July 22.

Fire of unknown origin destroyed a
barn back of the residence of R. H.
Greene at 330 North First avenue, last
night at 11:10, furnished a little work
for the department and vast entertain
ment for a big crowd of autoists and
others.
The building valued at $150 was a
total loss, though there is about $100
worth of insurance. Luckily there was
nothing in the barn nor very near it at
the time, for so speedy was the spread
of the flames, efforts to save anything

would have been fruitless. The firemen
spent their time and water protecting
the house and adjoining stables, which
were in no little peril when the sparks
and burning splinters began to fly.
The call was rung at 11:10 and by the
time the wagons had arrived things
were pretty warm in the neighborhood
of the barn. The heat added to dust,
darkness and confusion made it diffi
cult for the firemen to get near the
building. Lighted fragments of shingle
were thick in the air making necessary
streams on all the nearby houses. The
pressure was working well, however,
and no great amount of danger result
ed from the heat or flying brands.
After the excitement was over Fire
Chief Sullivan conducted an informal
inquiry to find if possible the cause of
the fire. As far as he could tell the
blaze might have started in a number
of ways, but nothing definite could be
learned. The owner thinks the morn
ing light may serve to explain the mys
tery, though there is little chance that
any real clues remain in the wreck.
As a sort of preliminary to the big
ger conflagration a motorcycle caught
fire at the corner of First and Wash
ington streets just before the alarm
was turned in. The machine was
stacked in the street and the rider try
ing to start it by pedaling. A spark
from the ignition set fire to some leak
ing gasoline and the result was a beau
tiful display of flames. Fear of an ex
plosion of the gas tank caused a gener
al stampede of passersby, but for some
reason the expected failed to happen.
Higgins, the owner of the machine will
consider himself lucky if the damage
amounts only to burnt enamel, for
though the fire lasted but a moment, it
may have harmed some of the metal
parts.
o
TELEPHONE TALK
IS ADMISSIBLE
Unprecedented Ruling by The Califor
nia Supreme Court.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
SAN FRANCISCO, July 9. For the
first time in the history of the courts
of California a telephone conversation
was admitted as legal evidence in a de
cision handed down today by the state
supreme court. The case is one in
which the Union Construction company
was suing the Western Union for dam
ages incurred by reason of failure to
deliver a telegram, thus allowing a
valuable option to expire. The plain
tiffs showed that they had called up
the telegraph office, to inquire wheth
er there were any messages for them
and had been informed that there were
none, but the lower court held that,
even if they proved their contention,
there was no way of identifying the
person at the other end and therefore
the evidence as to the conversation
was inadmissible.
In reversing the decision the supreme
court ruled that “there was sufficient
circumstantial evidence to make out a
prima facie case to identify to prove
that the office of the Western Union
was reached by telephone and that its
agent answered.”
o
PRACTICAL POLITICS
BY PROHIBITIONISTS
Proposal to Quit Howling for the
Church Vote
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
ATLANTIC CITY, July 9. A presi
dential nomination boom on the basis
of a new issue that would sub
stitute practical politics for “church
politics” in the prohibition movement
was started here tonight on the eve
of the prohibition national conven
tion.
Finley G. Hendrickson, of Cumber
land, Md., was launched as a candi
date for the presidential nomination
by the Maryland delegation, which
will appeal for his selection on a
broad platform especially urging that
there be a more earnest appeal for
votes outside the churches and that
energy of the party be not expended
in “howling for the church vote.”
Hendrickson who is a member of
the prohibition party’s executive com
mittee, is a strong advocate for more
practical politics in the prohibition
movement.
o
Charles Arrison, a politician, and
Miss Helen Prenderville, who were
married in Philadelphia, are so popular
that four thousand persons attempted
to enter the house and extend congrat
ulations.
The bride became frantic and her
father finally sent in a riot call, and
patrolmen and mounted men dispersed
the crowd, so the couple would reach
the motor car that took them to the
station. From the New York Evening
World.

H. L. Lee is having an exceedingly
heavy crop of wheat threshed this
week; the grain is expected to go
over twenty-five sacks per acre. The
ground was well plowed and disced
before the grain was sown, a fact
which the owner thinks accounts for
the extra heavy crop.
The Black Canyon Indian club held
its regular meeting Monday night, at
which a number of interesting topics
were discussed. The real subject of
the evening was the “Advance of Civ
ilization,” on which Joel Whitney
spoke. Mr. Maloney gave a few com
parisons of modern civilization to the
life in the garden of Eden down to
the queen of Sheba as she rode over
the hot sands at the rate of four
miles per hour on the back of a
camel. He said if she had lived in
this day she could have called King
Solomon over a telephone or could
have traveled to his place in a cool
electric car, speeding over the desert
at the rate of fifty miles per hour.
Then down to the early seamen, who
traveled the rough seas in boats on
modern palaces on water. The war
ships of Rome and Greece were push
ed over the seas by men chained to
their oars while today huge auto
matically fired engines drive the ar
tificial islands at a terrific rate of
speed. After the talk the members
sang the Star Spangled Banner. The
rest of the evening was spent at
cards and refreshments.
After an absence of over twelve
years Lee Kayser has stopped with
relatives here to renew old acquaint
ances and look into business oppor
tunities in which he may become in
terested. Mr. Kayser says that this
valley looks good to him and ex
pects to move here as soon as pos
sible. His first visit to this country
was in 1878.
Smith Chittock has just returned
from Kansas City, where he was
called to the bedside of his mother,
who died shortly after his arrival.
Smith says the heat in Kansas City
is almost unbearable but the crops
are in fine condition. He also says
the more he visits other places the
better he likes the Salt River valley.
J. F. Cleaveland has moved to his
newly built bungalow on the Black
Canyon road where he will live till
the first of August, when with his
wife he will leave for Denver to
make a short stay. From there they
will make a tour of the eastern
states, returning in the early fall.
The famous herd of red poll cat
tle has been moved from the Pem
berton ranch on the Cave Creek road
to a field along the car line where
the people traveling over the Indian
school and Glendale line can see
them.
President Mitchell of the Phoenix
Street Railway company says the
work on the proposed second track
for the Indian school line will not be
started before the early fall. Several
business negotiations are hindering
this work.
The alfalfa in the orange groves of
George Halm has proved a perfect
success. Two tests have been made
in the same grove; one strip has
been left unplanted and the other,
which has been planted to alfalfa,
shows larger and more oranges and
seems to hold the moisture much
longer than the cultivated part. The
leaves are also in a healthier con
dition. Mr. Halm will plant alfalfa in
all his groves this fall.
The ranch owned by S. S. Scull has
been sold to L. K. Leaver, who has
taken possession and expects to make
extensive improvements.
The Pacific Gas & Electric com
pany has purchased enough material
to extend the electric line as far
north as the Grand canal and will
soon finish the work already started.
The line now runs two and a half
miles north of Phoenix on the Black
Canyon road.
Work has been started on the J. W.
Dorris house on the Black Canyon
and Thomas roads. The house will
cost upwards of $30,000 and will be a
credit to the valley. The house will
be of brick and plastered on the
outside. A well has been drilled and

a tower erected.
H. C. Smith is here from Ann Ar
bor, Mich., where he has just fin
ished his third year of his six-year
law course which he will finish. Mr.
Smith is staying with his sister, Mrs.
W. Hedgpeth. He is a graduate of
the Phoenix high school.
Miss Marie Felch will leave for
points in southern California the 27th
of this month. Among the places
which she will visit are Los An
geles, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Riv
erside and Yosemite park. Miss Felch
will be gone about a month.
Mrs. G. H. Bailey and Miss Geor
gia Bailey are spending a few days
at the beautiful country home of
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Cleaveland on the
Black Canyon road.
Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Bishop and
children left for Prescott where they
will spend the remainder of the sum
mer. They will make several camp
ing trips from there.
Miss Ursula Weber spent a few
days last week with friends in Tempe.
Many are planning camping trips
to various parts of Arizona for this
summer.

IN FOR IT.
“Always eat the skin of the fruit,”
ordered the doctor. “The skin con
tains essentials that you need.”
“That may be, doc. But I know
I’m going to get my throat scratched
up the first time I try to eat a pine
apple with its skin on.”

It has just been discovered here in
Phoenix that the supposition which
prevailed before the Baltimore con
vention, when Woodrow Wilson was
nominated for the presidency on the
democratic ticket, to the effect that
Arizona, including Maricopa county,
was for Champ Clark, was all wrong.
This discovery is due to the fact that
about nine out of ten democrats one
meets nowadays profess to have been
the original Wilson men; and if one
is to believe the declarations, assever
ations, and assertions which are
thrown about so promiscuously the
Arizona democracy never did consider

anybody but Woodrow Wilson at all!
Of course, it is true that at the
primary eleven out of every twelve
votes were cast for Clark. But what
has that got to do with it?
As has been noted, this rather pe
culiar condition is a matter of com
mon, everyday observation. But it
was also strikingly illustrated at the
meeting held a night or two ago at
Lysander Cassidy’s office for the pur
pose of preparing for the Wilson and
Marshall ratification meeting to be
held on the city hall plaza Saturday
night. That meeting, to borrow a
phrase from the classics, was some
thing of a hummer.
Among other things that transpired
there, there was quite a lot of
speeches. Real, old-fashioned oratory
that warms the cockles of the demo
cratic heart, if the average demo
cratic heart is equipped with cockles,
and it is presumed it is. Among the
speakers were Mr. Cassidy and Frank
DeSouza. It is known and has been
known all the time that Cassidy and
DeSouza are and also have always
been Wilson men, so there was no
surprise at their declarations of joy
that the New Jersey man had been
nominated.
But with some of the others it was
quite different. One speaker after
another was called; and every man
who had formerly been classed as a
Clark booster got on his feet and de
clared that it was the happiest mo
ment of his life when the news came
that the Jersey pedagogue had pulled
down the nomination plum. These
men, according to their solemn decla
rations, were Wilson men, always
had been Wilson men, and had never
thought of being anything else than
Wilson men. It was one grand and
glorious love feast until C. B. Wood
was called upon to speak.
Now, Wood is from Missouri and is
an old neighbor of Mr. Clark’s. He
expressed some surprise that there
seemed to be nothing but Wilson men
in Arizona for, he said, judging by
the primaries, it really seemed there
had been some Clark men here. How
ever, he said, the state of the meet
ing seemed to indicate that about
everybody had always been for Wil
son and in view of that fact he won
dered just where the votes for Clark
had come from at the primaries. “In
Missouri, we stand up for our man,”
Mr. Wood said, “but we know how
to take a thrashing; and if the steam
roller runs over us, we get up and go
to work for the candidate, even
though we may wish it had been the
other fellow rather than ourselves
that had been flattened.”
Then came Judge Barnum.
“I notice you are all Wilson men,”
the judge said, “and that seems a lit
tle strange in view of the fact that
before the primaries about everybody
seemed for Clark. And the same
thing seems true pretty much all over
the country. I notice that about
everybody is a Wilson man now and
that leads me to wonder that Mr.
Wilson had such a hard time getting
nominated. So, I advise you fellows,
if you had such a hard time nomin
ating your man with practically the
whole country back of him you would
better be up and doing if you expect
to get anything accomplished in the
campaign that is just starting.”
And then they all looked at each
other and wondered if Barnum really
meant what he said.
In addition to this exchange of
felicitations there was a speech by
Judge P. A. Wren, of Yavapai county.
Wren took something of a fall out of
Harry Davis, who on the Glorious
Fourth went up to Williams where
in the course of a speech he had paid
his respects to the Yavapai county
senators for voting and working
against woman suffrage. But he said
Davis is a pretty good democrat at
that, and he would rather vote for

RECLAMATION IN EGYPT
One of the most costly and com
prehensive drainage projects for the
reclamation of lands undertaken by
any government in the world, and
certainly the greatest enterprise of its
kind in Mediterranean countries, has
just been begun by the Egyptian gov
ernment to make cultivable 1,000,000
acres of fertile land in the delta of
lower Egypt.
The reclaiming of these lands will

necessitate an expenditure approach
ing $15,000,000 for drainage and ap
proximately a like amount for irri
gation. The work as planned will re
quire over four years and will be
brought to completion about the end
of 1915. The principal object is to
redeem a tract of unproductive land
and bring a fertile but now worthless
region of the delta under cultivation.
When this is done it is roughly
estimated that the increase in value
of the reclaimed and improved land
will approximate $100,000,000. The
land to be reclaimed is 90 per cent
government owned. The two projects
known as the West Behera and the
Gharbia drainage systems, while en
tirely separate and distinct and many
miles apart, will, nevertheless, be pro
ceeded with coincidentally. A feature
of the western, or Behera plan, is the
drainage of Lake Mariout, which cov
ers an area of over 35,000 acres. This
lake, an ancient, historical site, will
thus disappear forever and be re
placed by fertile cotton producing
fields equal to those found anywhere
in the world. Consular and Trade
