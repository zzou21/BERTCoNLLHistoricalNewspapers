Comedy Again Crops Out in
Courtroom as Former President Crosses His Legs and
Recounts Political History.
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL LEASED WIRE
Syracuse, N. Y., May 6. The ethics
of boss rule and machine politics as
Theodore Roosevelt claims William
Barnes exemplified them, were replied
by the former president upon the wit
ness stand in the Supreme court suit
today. Colonel Roosevelt swore that
Mr. Barnes had told him that the
"riff-raff could not be trusted to han
dle the political machinery without a
leader," and expressed himself as be
ing in favor of the democratic and re
publican organization combining to
defeat legislation providing for direct
primaries.
The colonel went upon the stand at
the end of the day with testimony about public printing and mil
lion money. He related what he al
leged to be the substance of conver
sations he had with the former chair
man of the republican state committee
over a period of from 1904 until
he left the White House, in part it
follows:
"I had many discussions with
Mr. Barnes and I had many con
versations upon the nature of the boss
and upon the power and the neces-
sity for the machine under our sys
tem of party government.
"Mr. Barnes said it was neces
sary that the head of the organization
should have complete control and he
instanced Albany county. He said the
riff-raff could not be trusted to han
dle political affairs without a leader.
He said they would misconduct them
selves at the expense of property and
that the government could not go on.
He said it was not necessary for the
boss to issue orders to executive offi
cials and legislators and that they
found out for themselves that if they
did not support the organization they
could not get bills through, they
would not be renominated and they
could not secure funds with which to
carry on campaigns. He said it was
to their interests to find out what they
should do and then do it.
"Mr. Barnes said: 'You know the
Platt does not bully. He does not have to.' He said it was
sufficient to have it understood that if a man did not stand by the or
ganization he got punished."
Hoars of laughter came from the
spectators, interrupting the colonel
for a moment.
Then the witness said:
"He got punished and eliminated."
John M. Bowers, chief counsel for
the defendant, asked him this quea
tion: "You say there were similar con
versations while you were president?"
"Didn't I say that?" asked the col
onel, pointing to the stenographer;
"Just read what I said there. Yes, I
thought I did."
"What else did Mr. Barnes say?"
asked Mr. Bowers.
The colonel crossed his legs and
turned to face the jury. He replied:
Mr. Barnes said it was not neces
sary to ask business men for contri
butions; that they were not coerced
into it. Mr. Barnes also told me
either at Oyster Bay or at the White
House after the election of Governor
Hughes that the organization had
complete control of the legislature.
He said that the effort to pass the
primary bill reported an effort to
break down party government and
that the democratic and republican
organization should make a common
cause against the legislation. On an
other occasion he said that the pie
could not govern themselves and that
they had to have bosses."
Only the "Organization."
"You mentioned democrats making
a common cause with republicans.
Do you mean all democrats?" asked
Mr. Bowers.
The colonel with a smile replied:
"I said the democratic organiza
tion." "Colonel Roosevelt," said Mr. Bow
ers, "I'll show you articles that ap
peared in the New York Herald in
May, 1912, and ask you whether you
read them prior to the time you
caused the publication of the article
complained of?"
"I did, sir," replied the witness.
"Did you rely upon the statements
contained therein."
"I relied upon them after making
special inquiries about them.
The articles were read to the jury
after they had been inspected by Jus
tice William S. Andrews, presiding.
The first mentioned a "perfect under
standing between the Murphy boys
and the Barnes boys," in the state as
sembly. It stated that the leaders in
the legislature "smiled smugly." Mr.
Hughes was mentioned in the article.
The colonel, after being asked about
the man, said: "There was no Hughes
in the assembly then."
In the second article the capi
tal likened to a war map; "the
Barnes and Murphy forces"
were mentioned as were "promoters of in
visible government" and the "bipartisan combination of two machines"
which had, it was said, "defeated de-

real primary legislation favored by
Governor Hughes." It was also stated
in the article that "the only orders
issued today originated in Fourteenth
street (Tammany hall) and in Mr.
Barnes' office."
"Now," said Mr. Bowers to the wit
ness, "when you wrote the article
complained of, did you have in mind
any other matter of information that
has heretofore been brought to your
attention?"
"Yes," said the witness.
"Did any of it relate to an arrange
ment between the plaintiff here and
a man named McCabe, at one time
leader of the democratic party in Al
bany?"
Counsel for Mr. Barnes objected and
the judge said:
"This brings us back to the investi
gation of local conditions in Albany."
William M. Ivins being out of court
this afternoon his assistant thought
it well to request an adjournment un
til tomorrow, when the chief counsel
would be on hand to present argu
ments against those that might be of
fered by Mr. Bowers. Mr. Bowers an
nounced that there would be no more
direct examination until the witness
is allowed to tell about local condi
tions in state capital. The re
quest for an adjournment was grant
ed. So Colonel Roosevelt will resume the stand in the morn
ing. When court opened, John M. Bow
ers, chief counsel for Colonel Roo
sevelt, read into the record a digest of
the stockholders of the Albany Jour
nal company, compiled from the books
furnished by Barnes. The digest showed
that Barnes held nearly all the
common stock and that members of
his family held the majority of the
preferred stock and some of the com
mon. Other digests showed that prefer
red stock was also held at different
times by Anthony N. Brady, Levi P.
Morton, J. B. Lyon, the J. B. Lyon
company, C. A. Wurts, Charles B.
Hilles, Chauncey M. Depew, Nathan
Gisberg and others.
William J. Nusbaum, a certified
public accountant, the first witness
called, was asked to tell about an ex
amination made of the books of the
Journal company. Bowers said he
wanted to show that the J. B. Lyon
company paid sums of money, appa
rently commissions, to the Journal.
Lyod Manager Toll of KCOOtt.
Charles M. Winchester of the J. B.
Lyon company was then recalled to
show that there was an account with the
Journal company and that there were
times when "We paid the Journal com
pany commissions or discounts" upon
contracts for state, city and Albany
county printing.
Colonel Roosevelt was again called
to the witness stand late in the after
noon to testify in his own behalf. His
re-direct examination was expected to
be brief, but the indications were that
his re-cross examination would be
more or less exhaustive.
Progressive Chairman Called,
At the afternoon session, William
H. Hotchkiss, former state chairman
of the progressive party and state su
perintendent of Insurance from 1901
to 1911, was called.
Counsel for Colonel
Roosevelt said
they intended to show
that Mr. Hotchkiss and other witnesses that 3,112
more insurance reports than
needed were printed and that Mr.
Hotchkiss had tried to stop the wast
ing of public money for needless pub
lic printing and that Mr. Barnes was
responsible for the witness' failure to
accomplish this.
Efforts to get a bill through the leg
islature in 1912 to cut down by 11,000
the number of copies of the Insurance
report printed, were described by the
witness. Hon. Introduced a compilation of the
valuation of Texas railroads made by
S. H. Cowan, attorney for the
American National Livestock association
The bill, he said, was passed after
being so modified that the regular
number of sets of reports continued
to be printed.
TO KEEP STRICT
Premier Asquith Declares All
Violators of Rules of Warfare
Will Be Held to Strict
Accountability,
BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL LEASED WIRE
London, May 5 (10:00 p. m.)
When the proper time comes, due
reparation will be exacted on those
whatever their position or their ante
cedents if it can be shown that they
have violated all the rules and usages
of civilized warfare," said Premier
Asquith in the house of commons this
evening during a debate on the treat
ment of British prisoners by Germany.
He added that a careful record of
atrocities was being kept and of ev
idence which could be obtained in or
der that, when the proper hour came
proper punishment might be meted
out.
The premier referred to the question
of the neutral internment of prison
ers which had been considered. Hulls-
trom, he said, was one (Hunland
where it could be done, and there
were insuperable difficulties in the
way of carrying out the proposals.
The duty of this country,' concluded
the premier, "is to preserve a clean
record."
Indignation to Officers,
The question had been brought up
by Lord Hubert Cecil who said he had
received letters from officers who had
been subjected to special confinement
by Germany because of the special
treatment accorded German submarine
officers by Great Britain. The
officers declared that they were locked
up separately in cells 12 by 6 feet
and were not allowed to smoke.
Andrew Bonar Law, leader of the
opposition hoped that the country
would no longer pay any attention to
any convention which would prevent
the war being brought to an end.

BY MORNING JOURNAL SPECIAL LEASED WIRE
Chicago, May 6. Advances in
freight rates on livestock, one of the
commodity rate increases promised
by forty-one western railroads, was
opposed today at the western rate
hearing by witnesses from widely
separated districts. O. L. Owen, a
member of the corporation commis
sion of New Mexico, testified that the
advance in freight charges on live
stock from New Mexico was not jus
tified in comparison with other
freight rate increases. He stated that the
earnings of the Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe railroad on its Pecos valley
line were 11 per cent, or $13,600
per mile of road. On cross-examlnation
about 1,331 miles, instead
of the 500

declared that his figure
made no reference to the cost

T. W. Tomlinson, secretary of the
American National Livestock association,
said that the earnings covered
the entire line in New Mexico.
He declared that there has been no
marked improvement or falling off in
the earnings of the Santa Fe in New
Mexico. He said there was little differ
ence in the speed of freight trains, whether
loaded with livestock or other com
modities.
Western Rates Higher.
Comparative figures were presented
by Walter Condon, rate clerk
of the Iowa railroad commission,
showing that western freight rates on
livestock are higher than eastern
rates on the same commodity.
Statistics presented in the record
of the Texas rate case decided several
years ago and incorporated in the
present hearing last week were ex
tended to cover the entire line in New
Mexico.
A group of exhibits covering freight
transported on the Chicago and
Northwestern railroad was
presented by F. W. Hillman, expert con
sulting accountant, who said that his compila
tion of livestock on that road was 81.01
per cent, while on all the traffic the
ratio was 74.7 per cent.
His figures of profit in freight car
rying were based on gross tonnage
and were subjected to sharp cross-ex
amination.
Says Figures Are Incurred,
He was called to the stand by Cuf
ford Thorne, chairman of the com
mission of state railway commissions
opposing the proposed advanced rates.
Before Mr. Hillman began his testi
mony T. W. Tomlinson of Denver
made formal objection to the testi
mony "On behalf of the American Na
tional Livestock association, the Lit
tle Raisers' Association of Texas and the
National Wool Growers' association,"
said Mr. Tomlinson. "I desire to ob
ject to the introduction of this testl
imony.
"I believe that the figures at
best are of errors. In saying this I do not
wish to reflect on the state commis
sions which are introducing the fig
ures or the clever gentlemen who
got them up but I believe they do not
reflect correctly the earnings, profit
or cost of livestock traffic."
The objection was overruled.

Summary of War
News of Yesterday
The extent of the Austro-German
victory in the Carpathians was indicated
in the German official communication
in which the statement is made that
the third fortified line of the Russians
had been pierced by the Teutonic al
lies; Russians are beginning to evac
uate positions on their north, in
flank, southwest of Dukla, and that
the Russian prisoners taken
more than 30,000.
The Russian official statement
that the fighting in Galicia between
the Vistula and the Carpathians is
"bitter," and that the Germans have brought up
fresh forces of great strength to the
firing line with much artillery and
that the Germans attacking in massed
formation, are suffering "enormous
losses."
The Russian war office admits that
several nights ago some of the Rus
sian units fell back to the second line
of fortifications. No late report is av
ailable respecting these particular opera
tions.

There has been fighting all along
the rest of the western front in all
of which the Germans claim to have
been successful. The French, however,
have another story to tell. They
insist that their advance continues
both along the Yser canal, in Flanders,
and in the Woevre, where battles
have been continuous for weeks
on end.
Conflicting reports from the bellig
erents in the east make it impossible
to quite judge of the position there.
The Austrians and Germans tonight
say that the Russians have been
beaten in western Galicia and have
commenced to retire from the western
Carpathians, while the latest Russian
reports, while admitting that the Austro-Germans
succeeded in getting
across the Dunajec river declares that
many were checked here.
Fighting in East Prussia
The country around the east Prus-
sian frontier also has been the scene
of battles of more or less importance
while at the other end of the, Russian
line. In eastern Galicia, the Russians
are attacking the Austro-German
despite their reported defeat or check
in the western part of that province.
Athens credits the allies with further successes
in their attacks on the Dardanelles and Smyrna but the Turks
again report the defeat of the allied
troops, who have landed on the Halli
poli peninsula.
The German submarines seemingly
now are devoting their attention to
the British fishing fleet. Fifteen
trawlers have been sunk since Sunday
night but without any loss of life.
