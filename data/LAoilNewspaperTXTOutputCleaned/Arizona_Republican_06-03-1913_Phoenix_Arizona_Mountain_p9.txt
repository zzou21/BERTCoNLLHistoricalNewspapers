EVERYBODY'S DRUG
STORE
Tempe, Arizona

A number of the members of the
Mexican population of Tempe and
vicinity Sunday decided to celebrate
the recent prohibition election by
getting on a big drunk and parad­
ing up and down the center of
town, just to see if there is such a
thing as dry territory in Maricopa
county. Four of the men soon
found out that as far as the city
officials were concerned Tempe is
sure enough dry. Marshal M. C.
Browning gave chase as soon as he
found out what was the matter and
lined Juan Yutes, Mariano Olaya,
S. Prano Lopez and Rosondo Rod­
riguez up before the justice of the
peace.
Fines of from five to twenty dol­
lars were assessed against the men.
One of the men paid his fine in the
shape of bond on Sunday night and
was therefore allowed to sleep in his
own bed. The other men remained
as guests of the corporation of
Tempe for the night. One of the
men was unable to find the re­
quisite amount to pay his fine and
so remained in the city hotel.
There were two others with the
gang on Sunday when they were
lparading but they succeeded in giv­
ing the officers the slip. It is
thought that the men got their con­
traband from Phoenix either on Sat­
urday night or surreptitiously and
came back to Tempe to drink it in
spite of the “drys.”

department work of every class in the
institution is exhibited which is as
wide a variety as may be found in a
similar department of any state nor­
mal school. The clay exhibit includes
a display of the work accomplished
voluntarily by the students, it not be­
ing included as an essential of the
course. The three exhibits, the draw­
ing in the science hall, and the other
two in the basement of the main
building, will be open throughout to­
day and tomorrow to all to view them.

SHORT PAID LETTERS
Postmaster J. W. Mullen of the Tem­
pe office complains that many letters
mailed here addressed for delivery in
foreign countries are prepaid only two
cents, the senders being under the im­
pression that the two cent domestic

ters. The only foreign destinations to
which the two cent letter rate applies
are Canada, Cuba, Mexico, the Republic
of Panama, Newfoundland, the Canal
Zone, Great Britain, Ireland, Scotland,

To all other places the rate
is five cents for the first ounce
three cents for each additional
ounce or fraction thereof. For careful
handling prepay your foreign mail at
the correct rate.

Burlington, Iowa.—“Lydia E. Pink-
ham’s Vegetable Compound has cured
my daughter of
weakness. She was
troubled almost a
year with it and
complained of back­
ache, so that I
thought she would
be an invalid. She
was entirely run
down, pale, nervous
and without appe­
tite. I was very
much discouraged
but heard of Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vege­
table Compound through friends and
now I praise it because it has cured my
daughter.”—Mrs. F. M. Elston, R. D.

Scanlon, Minn.—“I used to be both­
ered with nervous spells, and would cry
if anyone was cross to me. I got aw­
fully weak spells especially in the morn­
ing, and my appetite was poor. I also
had a tender place in my right side
which pained when I did any hard
work. I took Lydia E. Pinkham’s Veg­
etable Compound and my symptoms all
changed, and I am certainly feeling
fine. I recommend it to every suffering
woman or girl. You may use this let­

Girls who are troubled with painful or

MESA PLANTERS WILL
HOLD COTTON MEETING

Many Matters of Importance to Be
Brought Before Directors

There will be an adjourned direct­
ors’ meeting of the Mesa Egyptian
Cotton Exchange today at the city
hall. Several matters of importance
will come up and every member
should be present. There seems to
be a disposition on the part of sever­
al cotton planters around Mesa to
keep out of the organization, and
not only that, but they seem to have
a most exaggerated idea of its ca­
pacity for injuring those who should
join. It is a well known fact that
with union there is strength. But
there are a great many farmers who,
because of the fact that they have
always made a living and paid their
debts, believe that they will always
be able to run their business in the
same independent way. It would be
very nice if such were the case, but
the farmer is facing conditions today
that are far different from those of
forty years ago. The corner grocery
is no longer an individual concern; it
can only sell at a concerted price
and buy the same way, no matter
who owns it. Buyers of cotton are
more thoroughly organized than
nearly any other branch of produce
buyers, and it is only by concerted
action on the part of the producers
that an advance price can possibly be
obtained. No single planter can hope
to get even a competitive bid on his
crop, but by combining and grading
cotton so that the buyer can know
just how many bales of a certain
kind he can get at one time it is
natural to suppose that the highest
prices can be obtained.
These different organizations in the
valley are controlled entirely by the
members, and the by-laws can be
changed at any time and it should
be the duty of every cotton planter
in the valley to join one or the other
of these cotton exchanges, and if they
do not suit him, help to regulate
them from the inside instead of
knocking them from the outside.
There is no time to spare in bick­
ering, cotton is growing, and there
will be pickers needed and gins need­
ed, and many other things needed
before the planters are ready for
them, and if these things are not
accomplished at once matters may
not run smoothly next fall. All cot­
ton planters are invited to attend.
There is each age of our lives has its joys.
Old people should be happy, and they
will be if Chamberlain’s Tablets are
taken to strengthen the digestion and
keep the bowels regular. These tab­
lets are mild and gentle in their ac­
tion and especially suitable for people
of middle age and older. For sale
by all druggists. Advertisement.

STOCKHOLDERS MEETING
There was a meeting of the stock­
holders of the Rosemore mine yes­
terday evening. It is reported that a
reorganization of the company will
be effected and that active work will
be started at the mine in the near
future. There is said to be some fine
ore in this property and that with
the improvements contemplated it will
be but a short time until it will be
among the producing mines in this
territory.
A. E. Parker, who has been east
for some time in the interest of the
mine, has returned and it is said that
he has interested eastern men in the
proposition to such an extent that
there will be no doubt of its future
prospects. Mr. Parker has become
interested in a new process for hand­
ling ore and expects to erect two or
three mills in the valley to demon­
strate its usefulness. The plants,
with a capacity of 175 tons, will cost
about $25,000 to erect. This system
of separating ores will handle ore as
low as two per cent copper, and the
more refractory the better. Mr.
Parker will return to Chicago in the
near future and will take about two
tons of the most rebellious ores he
can gather, to test out on this new
system. He states that ores handled
by this system leave the concen­
trates easy to separate.
A plant of 500-ton capacity at
Mesa would be a good proposition,
as Mesa is in easy access to several
good mineral fields.

A NEW SCHOOL DISTRICT
Guy Tyler, who owns a ranch
southwest of Higley, was in Mesa
yesterday with a petition of citizens
from his country, asking for the es­
tablishment of a new school district.
His part of the country, although
outside of the U. S. R. S., is being
rapidly developed by pumping water,
and is badly in need of school facili­
ties. People are moving into that
section very rapidly since it has been
seen that the underflow of water is
unlimited, and it will be but a short
time when that part of the desert
will be covered with green fields and
orchards, owned by a contented and
prosperous people.

Blood Bath
Knocks Rheumatism
Remarkable Effect of a Remedy That
Actually Irrigates the Entire
Blood Supply.

The thousands Not of This Rheumatism,
Is Pricked ly S. S. S.

It sounds queer to take a blood bath
yet that is precisely the effect of a
most remarkable remedy known as
S. S. S. It has the peculiar action of
soaking through the intestines directly
into the blood. In five minutes its in­
fluence is at work in every artery,
vein and tiny capillary. Every mem­
brane, every organ of the body, every
emunctory becomes in effect a filter to
strain the blood of impurities. The
stimulating properties of S. S. S. com­
pel the skin, liver, bowels, kidneys,
bladder to all work to the one end of
casting out every irritating, every
pain-inflicting atom of poison; it dis­
lodges by irrigation all accumulations
in the joints, causes and accretions to
dissolve, renders them neutral and
scatters those peculiar formations in
the nerve centers that cause such
mystifying and often baffling rheu­
matic pains.
And best of all, this remarkable
remedy is welcome to the weakest
stomach. If you have drugged your­
self until your stomach is nearly para­
lyzed, you will be astonished to find
that S. S. S. gives no sensation but
goes right to work. This is because
it is a pure vegetable infusion, is
taken naturally into your blood just
as pure air is inhaled naturally into
your lungs.
You can get S. S. S. at any drug
store at $1.00 a bottle. It is a standard
remedy, recognized everywhere as the
greatest blood antidote ever discov­
ered. If yours is a peculiar case and
you desire expert advice, write to The
Swift Spec. Co., 197 Swift Bldg.,
