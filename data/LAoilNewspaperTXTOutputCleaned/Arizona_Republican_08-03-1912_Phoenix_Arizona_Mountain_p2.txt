TEMPE’S POPULATION
FURTHER DECREASED
Company C. Departs for a Two
Week’s Encampment.
Tempe was relieved of twenty-seven
more of its population yesterday
in addition to the large number who
are away for their summer vaca
tions by the occurrence of National
Guard Encampment at Fort Hua
chuca. Company C officers have been
at work for a month or more in
the hopes of interesting enough in
the event to secure thirty-eight
members or over in order that they
might go as a separate company.
That number was not secured though
and as a result Company M of
Florence was taken in with the local
boys.
In the past week some fifteen men
have been added to the ranks of
Company C, a large majority of
whom had never drilled before.
Naturally a good deal of time
was spent drilling the commonly
called “Awkward Squad.” Thursday
night every member of the com
pany was given a chance to post
up a little on the new regulations
and a good steady drill of about two
hours was put in.
Company M arrived in town
Thursday evening, that being the best
connection they could make with
the special train. They camped over
night in the local armory where the
full company was made up out of the
two previous smaller ones. The
Florence company was composed of
about twenty-five men making in all
a little over fifty.
The new company is in charge of
Captain S. O. Thompson of Com
pany M. of Florence. First Lieuten
ant Mullen and Second Lieutenant
Mouer of the local company will
retain their respective positions. The
non-commissioned officers are about
equally divided between members of
the two companies. Luke Anton,
formerly bugler for the Phoenix U.
S. Indian School cadet company has
been secured to fill that position
with the local boys.
The special train used in the
transportation of the troops from
the valley to Fort Huachuca was due
to arrive here at nine o’clock but
owing to some trouble at the start
it was delayed an hour.
The train was composed of six
coaches and by the time it left
here every one was full. Company
D. of Mesa boarded at this place
also.
Company C. expects to do its
share in the way of athletic feats.
It has some good material for a base
ball nine among its ranks and also
for a track team. It is understood
that several days will be given over
to the enjoyment of these national
sports and that practically every
company will be represented. Among
the local boys who are likely to
play ball are Spikes, Mullen, Haby,
Blake, Anton, Ochoa and Cosner. It
is not known exactly just what the
Florence boys are capable of doing
along that line but from what could
be learned they are also pretty
strong. There is little doubt among
the members of Company C. but
what they will come home victorious
in all varieties of athletics, at least
those are their hopes.

A vast amount of ill health is due
to impaired digestion. When the
stomach fails to perform its func
tions properly the whole system be
comes deranged. A few doses of
Chamberlain’s Tablets is all you
need. They will strengthen your di
gestion, invigorate your liver, and
regulate your bowels, entirely doing
away with that miserable feeling due
to faulty digestion. Try it. Many
others have been permanently cured
why not you? For sale by all
druggists.
o
TO HOT SPRINGS.
August Pauvell writes that he is
now nicely located at the Agua Cal
iente Hot Springs. Mr. Pauvell left
here last Wednesday for that place
in the hopes of benefiting his health
but at the present time it is a little
early to see just what results will
be met with.

NEW POSITION.
Miss Ophelia Celaya, a member
of the 1912 graduating class of the
Tempe Union High School has ac
cepted a position with W. J. Kings
bury as stenographer and entered
upon her new duties yesterday morning.

Hot weather brings skin troubles.
Perspiration irritates.

The thing to do is to cool the skin
and for this there is nothing so good
as that cooling, soothing wash, the D. D.

A 25 cent trial bottle will give you
instant relief.

BASE BALL TOMORROW.
It was thought that with the de
parture of the National Guard Tempe
would be without a base ball team
for a few weeks. It has developed
though that only two of the team
left and although they are the best
two the team can boast, what re
mains are willing to tackle the job
alone. Consequently a game will in
all probability be played here to
morrow afternoon. Further men
tion of the fact will be made in to

HOME FROM GRAND CANYON.
Dr. E. W. Baum, a brother of

ago taking the route by Prescott and
Camp Verde. On the return, how
ever, they came by Payson and
Roosevelt. All in the party report a
most pleasant trip and one almost
devoid of any trouble. The doctor
continued on to his home in Phoe
nix last night.

o
ENROUTE.
Mrs. John Carruthers, formerly
Miss Belle Dunegan of this place,
came down from Ray Thursday
evening and spent the night here
with her sister. She left yesterday
morning for a short visit with her
parents in New Mexico after which
she will return to Clifton where
their future home is to be made.
A BABY BOY.
Mr. and Mrs. B. H. Dodt of Phoe
nix are rejoicing over the arrival
of an eight-pound baby boy at their
home. Mrs. Dodt was formerly Miss

THEN HE BLEW OUT.
“You say he died of a single blow
administered by himself?” asked
Scroggs, discussing the decease of
Farmer Giles, who passed away sud
denly while staying in town.
“Yes, poor fellow!” replied Scroggs.
“But that isn’t possible.”
“Oh, yes, it is.”
“Well, then, how could he do it?”
“He blew out the gas.”

IRON SPRINGS

IRON SPRINGS, Aug. 1. This week
it has been almost useless to plan to
get out of camp. Several times rains
have prevented any efforts to leave
door up or down. Then the trains
took their share in the plot. Tuesday
the train from Phoenix was delayed
four hours by a series of breaks on
the engine. Wednesday morning the
down freight was wrecked—three or
four cars jumped the track, one trainman
suffered serious injuries, and it is re
ported that a hobo who was stealing
a ride had his legs so severely crushed
that amputation was necessary. Pas
sengers were transferred at the
wreck and the track will be open in
time for regular trains today, when
people will doubtless begin to flock to
Prescott again, as the rains appear to
be over for a time.
There were several tables of bridge in
the pavilion. Mrs. Harry Kennedy and
Mr. Hulett made high score.
Mrs. Frank Hilderbran is expected
in camp Saturday to be the guest of
Mrs. C. B. Dorris for a week.
Mrs. W. G. Tolleson left Wednesday
night for Phoenix. There has been a
little rumor afloat as to the reason of
this visit, which will doubtless be con
firmed by the Saturday morning’s
paper.
Mrs. Henry George came over from
Prescott Tuesday evening to be the
guest of Mrs. E. W. Lewis for a few
days.
Mrs. Aaron Goldberg returned from
Phoenix Wednesday morning and re
ports Phoenix as undergoing a change
of climate. The days were so com
fortable there were several afternoon
affairs during her stay in town the
past week.
The camp has begun to talk Yava
pai Club dance again. Another infor
mal dance is to be given Friday night.
Little Edward O’Malley suffered a
painful accident to his hand while
watching the clearing away of the
Prescott. A railroad tie dropped on
his hand, crushing his fingers. Dr.
Yount was called from Prescott.
Dr. Smith and Mr. James reached
Phoenix Monday night by 7 o’clock.
They had one or two difficulties, due
to the storms, but otherwise had a
splendid trip.
Mrs. Wm. G. Humbert, who has been
the guest of Mrs. H. B. Wilkinson for
a week, returns to Phoenix Thursday
night.
Mrs. E. W. Lewis and Miss Ruth
Jessop rode to Prescott Thursday morn
ing to keep a luncheon engagement
in town.
Chester Goldberg returned from
Phoenix on the delayed train Tuesday.
Mrs. C. M. Scott and Mrs. I. J. John
son returned from Phoenix Tuesday.
Mrs. Ripley’s apron party at the pa
vilion Tuesday afternoon was a suc
cess, even though the ladies were han
dicapped by the want of material. The
late train was to bring all their apron
stuff from Phoenix, but many interest
ed club members brought a length or
two of muslin, which resulted in a
goodly number of aprons.
Mr. David Goldberg returned to
Phoenix Friday.
Lloyd Frize was in camp over the
week end, the guest of John Latham.
Dr. Ancil Martin came up Wednes
day night to spend a few days in camp.
The boy friends of Walter Martin
will be interested to hear that the
guide who is piloting them through the
Yellowstone Park is the broncho buster
Nelson, who was the star of Buffalo
Bill’s Wild West Show, which toured
Europe several years ago. Nelson had
the distinction of riding before Queen
Victoria and the Prince of Wales.
The boys will expect some exhibi
tions of fine riding when Walter re
turns from this trip.
Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Murphy arrived
Wednesday noon. They are opening
their cottage for the season.
The children’s dance was postponed
till Friday afternoon on account of the
Collings-Griffin party Thursday after
noon, which was held in the pavilion.
There is a scheme to have a bridge
afternoon for the benefit of the apron
booth at the coming Woman’s Club
fair. An admission of 15 cents is to be
charged.
Mrs. Dameron and Mrs. McLellan
returned to Phoenix Tuesday after a
week’s stay in camp, the guests of
Mrs. T. E. Irvine.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Diehl left Phoe
nix Wednesday morning on an over
land trip to Prescott. They are ex
pected to make a short stay in camp
en route.
Mrs. T. E. Irvine and Mrs. W. S.
Heflin entertained delightfully with a
thimble party Monday afternoon in
honor of their guests, Mrs. Dameron
and Mrs. McLellan. The house was
tastefully decorated with clematis blos
soms. The guests were Mesdames
Dan McDermott, W. G. Tolleson, L. W.
Coggins, E. O’Malley, T. L. Earle, M.
A. Irving, G. Fred Sharpe, Safford, C.
S. Griffin, Miss Annette Earle and
Miss Shannon.
Mr. T. E. Irvine arrived in camp
Monday night to spend a week.
o
GOING AWAY.
I weary of the ribbon dept.,
When days wax fine,
And want a beach by breezes swept
For mine.
I like to journey to the sea
Or some resort
And for a short vacation be
A sport.
And so I get my duck suit out,
The gay life seek
And have a big time for about
A week.
Sacred history should be taught in
the schools. Too many people took
Armageddon for a breakfast food.—

TRIP TO THE
GRAND CANYON

Doctor and Mrs. Baum
Back From a Long and
Interesting Automobile
Ride; Heavy Rains
in Tonto Basin

Doctor and Mrs. E. W. Baum re
turned home yesterday after a two
weeks’ tour in an automobile, that
proved to be a fine outing though
it was rather a strenuous one part
of the time.
Their tour was to the Grand Can
yon and back, going clear round the
circle. They went to the canyon
via Prescott, Ash Fork and Williams,
and found good roads most of the
way, experiencing no trouble what
ever and greatly enjoying the scene
ry. Returning they beheld even more
and finer scenery but they were
so busy watching their machine and
the road that they had little time to
enjoy it.
They returned via Flagstaff, Pay
son and Pine to Roosevelt and then
home. It was a delightful country
and the air was cool and bracing all
the time but the roads were in a
frightful condition. It rained much
of the time and the roads were not
only badly washed in places but the
wheel tracks were cut deeply by the
running water leaving troublesome
high centers in many places.
o
FIRST STATE FAIR
NOT THE EIGHTH
Commissioners Preparing a Memento
as to What Will Be Preserved.

Ribbons are going to constitute
quite a feature of the fair. The
commission assumes that they will
be greatly treasured in after years
as mementoes of the first state fair
and consequently it is the intention
to get handsome ones on which will
be printed in gold the words, “The
First State Fair.” A general idea
of the appearance of the ribbons,
except the coloring, may be seen in
the cover of the premium list design
ed by Mr. Howe Williams. The
prominent figures are a horse’s head
and a pretty girl from whose breast
floats one of the ribbons.
The premium list also announces
that the forthcoming fair is to be
the first state fair but there is the
added information that it is to be
the eighth annual Arizona fair, so
that strangers may know that the
management has had some experi
ence in such matters.
That this is the first state fair
and not the eighth is the fault not
of Arizona but of different con
gresses which declined to admit the
territory sooner. It stands to rea
son that a state fair cannot be suc
cessfully held in a territory.
o
THE CLOTHES LINE.
Two telephone girls in different
country exchanges were having a chat
over the wires on the subject of dress.
They were both going on the river
on the following Sunday afternoon,
and the discussion on what they
should wear waxed interesting.
For four minutes, five minutes, ten
minutes, the topic held their attention,
and was still unexhausted when an
impertinent, impatient, imperative
masculine voice broke up the con
versational meeting.
“Are you there?” the voice yelled.
“Are you there? Hello! Ah, at
last! Who is that speaking? Who—”
“What line d’you think you’re on?”
demanded one of the girls, indignant
and annoyed.
“Really,” came the weary reply, “I
don’t know; but from the discussion
that’s going on I should think I’m on
the clothes line!”
o
HER DUAL HUSBAND.
Lawyer—I think I am safe in say
ing that you will get your divorce,
madame.

Good
Meals
at Camp Comfort

The boys at Camp Comfort are using
the same stove that they had last year.
It was the best they could get. It was a
New Perfection
Oil Cook-Stove.
This year they got a New Perfection Oven
Also a New Perfection Toaster
Also a New Perfection Broiler.
“Gee, what a difference in the meals a good stove
makes,” said one of the boys. And they will tell their
mothers and wives about the stove, too. For the New
Perfection Oil Cook-Stove is as convenient for the home
as for the camp. It will bake, broil, roast and toast as
well as a regular coal range.

The New Perfection
Stove is handsomely fin
ished in nickel, with cabinet
top, drop shelves, towel
racks, etc. Long chimneys,
enameled turquoise-blue.
Made with 1, 2 or 3 burners.

WINKELMAN
WINKELMAN, Aug. 1. Mr. Millar,
manager of the Mesa Theater at
Winkelman, went to Miami Thurs
day to spend a week or two.
The long-expected pump for the
Antelope Peak Mining Co., Mr.
Myers manager, arrived in town
Monday. Mr. Myers states that he
has several cars of ore on the dump
ready for immediate shipment as
soon as the most favorable shipping
point for the particular class of ores
can be determined. On the installa
tion of the new pump the large bod
ies of ore lying below the water
level can be readily handled. It is
expected that this will make this
mine one of the regular shippers of
the vicinity.
Mr. K. F. Hill of Winkelman has
recently taken a contract for a large
concrete building to be erected at
Ray. This makes three concrete
buildings at present being construct
ed by Mr. Hill at Ray.
During the past week the people
of this city have been greatly dis
turbed by several severe thunder and
rainstorms. Fortunately little dam
age has been done. Mr. 
assistant postmaster had a narrow
escape when the house he was in
about 6 miles from Winkelman was
struck. A pet dog in the house
at the time had much of his hair
burned off by the lightning but is
otherwise in good health.

and is now one of the staff of the
Plant office.
Since the recent visit of the of
ficials of the Kelvin-Sultana Copper
Co. it has been decided to operate

has been placed for the necessary
machinery and the force is to be in
creased in the near future. At the
present time the mine has a payroll

GOLF REPARTEE.
The scene was the golf links and
the parson and the doctor were hav
ing a friendly match—at least the
match had been friendly till the for
mer found himself seven down at the
ninth hole. In fact the parson was
taking his beating very badly.
He kept thinking of all the things
he ought not to say, and the medico,
guessing his feelings, chortled audibly.
“My hole again!” said the doctor
for the tenth time, as he holed out a
fourteen-yard putt.
His reverence could contain himself
no longer.
“Sir,” he burst out, “I hope I may
live to read the burial service over
you!”
“Indeed!” said the doctor, with a
dry chuckle. “Well, it would still be
my hole.”
