GOT ANOTHER HIPPO.

Nairobi, July 16. Colonel Roosevelt succeeded in bringing down a big hippopotamus yesterday. It is estimated that it weighs three tons.

"For certainly it is a shame we can't afford to go up to Smart Set Beach this summer, Homer," remarked Mrs. Justwed. And it should be noted that her effusion was a remark, not a complaint at least Mrs. J. meant it as such.

"It will be the first summer I've missed there for one year," she continued, in the same tone. "I know, though, we can't afford it, so I've been looking around for another place."

"Humph!" was Mr. J.'s noncommittal reply.

"Yes, indeed," Mrs. Justwed went on. "You have no idea how hard I have tried to find a place."

"Aren't you a trifle precipitate, Blossom?" inquired Mr. J.

"Not at all, Homer; not at all. The trouble with most people is that they put off planning for their vacations, engaging their board and rooms, etc., until the last minute, when the roads are on and the hotel proprietors have them at their mercy. Now, I've been looking around, but everything is so frightfully high. I have one or two places in mind, though, that I think will be within reach of our pocketbook."

And forthwith Mrs. J. opened the drawer in her escritoire and drew forth a large bundle.

Mr. J. laid aside his evening paper and sat up.

Mrs. J. opened the package and a perfect stream of summer hotel booklets poured forth.

Mr. J. smiled quite a superior smile. "Where did you get all those?" he asked, in the tone that one uses when he is amused at the antics of a child.

"I saw the advertisements in the papers," Mrs. J. replied, quite seriously, and sent postals asking for booklets, terms, photos, etc."

Again Mr. Justwed smiled quite superiorly. "Trash! Absolute trash!" he exclaimed. "You might have saved your postage stamps, Blossom!"

Mrs. J. looked up, crestfallen. "Why, why, Homer," she began.

"I should think you'd know, Blossom," he insisted. "That every hotel that puts out a booklet like the ones you have is way beyond our means. Their prices are way up and the extras would literally swamp us. Now I have a little plan for the summer that will be just about the nicest way of spending a vacation you ever heard of—nothing more nor less than to stay at home and have a good time."

"Stay at home and have a good time!" interrupted Mrs. J. "Homer, are you crazy? A good time! I'd like to know what kind of a good time you can have in this stuffy old flat, with the mercury fairly bubbling out the top of the thermometer!"

"Now, there you go!" exclaimed Mr. Justwed, irritably. "There you go! Just let me suggest anything at all, and you bring out your little hammer and begin a regular drumbeat all over it! Honest to goodness, Blossom, I don't see how you can do it! You haven't even heard my plan before you bring out your little hammer and begin a regular drumbeat all over it! Hope you let me tell you about it first. It at least won't be as great a waste of time as looking over those foolish booklets you got from the hotels."

The latest in hairdressing, which, by the way, threatens to do away with the much-favored bandeaux, is the bandeaux. Nothing makes a woman look so much out of style as to have her hair dressed in an old-fashioned way, and as a result much attention has been paid to the latest methods of driving. The bandeaux effects are taking the place of the Greek fillet, and the shell bandeaux now sell from an eight to the same number of dollars. The simplest way to wear the bandeaux is to sweep the head at the top, lift back of the full head, often the exaggerated effect of flatness being placed behind the ear and held there the curved band of the shell. This leaves a little curly time at the edge of the joint band and this is what makes a soft

HOW NET WAS THROWN

ABOUT CANDELARIO DOREMY

It Was Necessary, Temporarily, to Catch a Woman.

Candelario Doremy and Josefa Ranjel will be given an examination before Commissioner Johnstone this morning on the charge of adultery. This case has developed in an unusual manner. Doremy was first arrested on the complaint of a little daughter of the woman, Antonia Torres, who said that Doremy was abusing her. In the course of the verbal complaint she made it known that her father and mother were separated and that Doremy, a young Mexican, was living with her mother, who was old enough to be his mother. He lived in idleness and Mrs. Ranjel supported him by taking in washing. This state of affairs had existed for some time and finally Doremy took the right to abuse the children of the woman.

He is arrested by Constable Murphy on a charge of a disturbance of the peace and he was held on that until arrangements could be made to proceed against him under the Edmunds act.

The little girl was again called upon. She demurred against making that kind of a complaint since it would involve her mother. She was told that a way would probably be found to disentangle her unworthy maternal ancestor from the meshes of the law which were being spread for Doremy. The woman was sent for and told how the land lay. As a result of the conference the complaint was made and the warrant was issued, directed against both the man and the woman.

ARMED WITH A KNIFE

As He Was Brought Into San Francisco Police Court.

San Francisco, July 16. When Jas. E. Cunningham, the self-confessed murderer of Miss Caroline Hatch, entered the police court for his preliminary hearing today, his guards noticed the gleam of metal in his hand and took from him an open knife which he had concealed in his palm. Cunningham admitted that he borrowed it from a man behind him in the chain gang line. Whether Cunningham planned suicide or an attack on the officers could not be learned.

Chief of Police Cook has ordered that charges of negligence be preferred against Policeman J. J. Clancy, who had charge of the chain gang.

For the woman who does not have the wherewithal given her by a loving husband or father, the securing of a vacation is a problem indeed. Of course, if she has a regular position the year round, it is simply a question of managing her funds so that when vacation time comes she will have sufficient laid by to defray the expenses. If she has not, however, or if she is a girl who is not compelled to work for her living, but is forced to earn her own vacation or, again, if she also wants extra pocket money for a trip, the fundamental expenses of which are paid for her—there are many little ways in which she can earn vacation money, some of them so unpromising that they are apt to be overlooked.

One woman last season went to a popular but moderate-priced resort in the mountains of Virginia. She had saved enough to defray her expenses for two weeks. She was charmed with the place and looked forward with regret to her approaching departure. Toward the end of the first week she noticed a number of the guests at one end of the veranda playing cards. There was one woman among them, however, who played first at one table, then at another, and so on until she had covered all. She was giving lessons in bridge while at 25 cents per capita, and she had a class of 16 three times a week. The observant woman thought the matter over. If she could only teach bridge she would earn sufficient, with her regular small allowance from home, to stay as long as she cared. She couldn't teach bridge, but she was an expert with her needle. She started, half-heartedly, to organize an embroidery class. The women, welcoming anything to help pass the long mornings, entered her class with enthusiasm. She stayed at the hotel until September.

Another girl earned her vacation in a most original manner. She was to college and didn't quite like to go to a gloss when dipped into the thinnest of starch water, rolled up hard, beaten hastily with the fist, and then ironed until the desired degree of polish is attained. The like rules obtain in the management of muslin pillowslips and sheets. Wall covering play a large part in making the home beautiful and many homes are spoiled by getting into the extreme with frescoes which are too elaborate. The proper kind of wall paper for a home is a hard thing to choose and many housewives make the mistake of hurrying through this task. The color and design should be attractive as well as the arrangement. The paper should be in keeping with the draperies, furniture and rugs.

The easiest way to make nine a unit is to take home a roll of the paper and compare it with the other decorations in the room. Walls are now decorated with cretonnes and madras, and one can often get pleasing effects in these materials. Wall hangings in silk and brocade are also in vogue. The silk looks quite similar to wall paper. It is very durable and can be washed easily with soap and water. One of the prettiest patterns of wall paper is a golden brown.

Curtains adjusted to drag half a yard on the carpet or lap over above have long been out of favor with the greater number of housewives, but they are still sold in three and three-and-a-half-yard lengths. In this way they are always cut off, leaving allowed to drop only a few inches below the edge of the window. Net curtains are considered the most desirable.

The man who eats his meals regardless of digestion and nutrition. He might almost as well eat shavings for all the good he gets out of his food. The result is that the stomach grows weak, the action of the organs of digestion and nutrition are impaired, and the man suffers the miseries of dyspepsia and the agonies of nervousness.

To strengthen the stomach, restore the activity of the organs of digestion and nutrition and brace up the nerves, use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It is an untailing remedy, and has the confidence of physicians as well as the praise of thousands healed by its use.

In the strictest sense "Golden Medical Discovery" is a temperance medicine. It contains neither intoxicants nor narcotics, and is as free from alcohol as from opium, cocaine and other dangerous drugs. All ingredients printed on its outside wrapper.

Don't let a dealer delude you for his own profit. There is no medicine for stomach, liver and blood "just as good" as "Golden Medical Discovery."

Carry a "Beauty Box"

Women travelers in the summer discover the need of a "beauty box" before their trip is over. One will frequently forget the kind of soap she has been using, or the cold cream will be misplaced, to be found missing when the summer's destination is reached. The hard cake of soap in the usual summer hotel often takes the skin from one's nose.

This beauty box must contain everything necessary for looks and comfort at home, and just a little more. For at home one can purchase the things that run out, but when exiled in some mountain hotel you may find it very difficult to find your needs. The wild woods are almost as secure from shops as the mythical Crusoe's Island. You may go for weeks without the needed beauty comfort, the bottle of toilet water, thimbleful of cold cream and the cake of good soap left behind. So before starting on your summer vacation prepare your beauty box with the utmost care and you will find it a great convenience, no matter where you go. Here are some of the things it should contain: a comb with coarse teeth, a brush with firm bristles, cold cream, powder, rouge, black cosmetics and toilet waters; a cake of good soap, fuller's earth, borax and some soft, clean rags. There must be, beside all the articles needed in manicuring, an eye cup, a pumice stone, a little of peroxide, various sorts of hair pins and some ribbons for the little "pigtail." It is best to buy for the receptacle then to make it or, if this is not probable in your town, take an old towel and sew up one end into four or more pockets.

Since the trunk does not always arrive at the destination as quickly as the traveler, it is best to carry the beauty box in a hand bag. As soon as you arrive at your resort cleanse the face and hands from all traces of train grime with water softened with borax. A little warm water in a small basin will relieve the eyes after they have been badly lacerated with cinder. The same remedy will relieve inflammation of the membrane of the nose, a malady with which many travelers suffer. The hair should be washed with warm water and eggs, to which should be added a small amount of scraping from a cake of castle soap. A good shampoo can be made in this manner. The beauty box will be used so frequently that you will wonder how you could have gotten along during the summer without it. The towel pocket device is also often taken along on steamers and can be hung in one corner of the stateroom. A tin box is often used, but it is not as handy as the towel pockets.

To Keep Milk in Summer.

ONE of the things for the housekeeper to consider, especially the mother, is the importance of being particular with milk in the summer, to secure pure milk one must sterilize or use the Pasteur method. Neither process is necessary. It has been found that the milk has arrived at the house very hot and the baby has been having, or at least, lessens the danger of its disagreeing. The actual process of sterilizing is not difficult, and simply means that it is brought to the boiling point, which kills germs. There are some sterilizers that have only to be placed on a stove, but with a kettle one may accomplish the same purpose. The kettle should contain enough cold water to come a trifle above the line of milk after the bottles have been placed in it. A cloth folded and placed over the bottom lessens the danger of breakage. The kettle is placed on the stove to come to the boiling point, and as soon as this occurs it is removed from the heat. The bottles must stay in the water half an hour. They are then taken out and allowed to cool quickly, after which they are kept cold until used. If the child is so young that it requires it fresh, the bottles can again be placed in the bath and the milk warmed. Many serious cases of illness have been prevented by this method. Another essential is to see that the bottles are clean. Klihler nipples should always be turned wrong side out and washed in soapy water, rinsed and placed in boracic acid until required for use.

Tenderfoot Farmer

These experimental farmers, who put green hay in a cow and feed it, say that it doesn't matter what the cow eats so long as she is led. The question of digestion and nourishment had not entered into his calculations.

It's only a "tenderfoot" farmer that would try such experiments.

The Latest in Hairdressing.

One of the other features of the summer hairdressing is the number of curls and loose tresses left about the face in apparent reckless abandon. These give a pretty effect. The "classic" hair dressing of the past winter has had its day and will probably never be used again by the fashionable.

The Summer Footwear.

Chic white shoes this summer are of suede, kid, and many have very high top, while the white headed tie is very popular. Suede in all shades still holds its own. One of the newest novelties is a pretty little house slipper in delicate color, with a leather-like little bow on one side. Mackintosh silvers and satins.

What to Eat at Picnics.

Now that the season of picnics is with us, the old question of what to take along to eat comes uppermost. All kinds of picnics require variety. For the boys' picnic, after a morning in the field, baked beans, sliced ham or beef, sandwiches, pickles, home-made doughnuts and pie are suggested. For the many "shoe box picnics," various kinds of sandwiches, each wrapped separately in oiled paper; deviled egg, separately wrapped; pickles, olives or radishes, small cakes, such as macaroons, lady fingers or ginger snaps, and fruits, raisins and nuts are edible.

For the bonfire picnic the following is suggested: Potatoes and eggs roasted in the ashes, grilled sandwiches that may be fastened to the end of green sticks and toasted over the coals, mussel clams, corn bread baked in the ashes, jam and molasses cookies.

For the picnic de luxe: Meat pies, flan pie and chicken patties, using individual dishes and marbled chicken, boiled tongue, creamed potatoes, prepared at home and reheated in a chafing-dish; a green salad with mayonnaise, small, buttered rolls, preserves, strawberries, raspberries, cream cheese, little cake and coffee.

For the fishing party: Souse of pig's feet, eggs stuffed with liver, liver sandwiches, dill pickles, turnovers, cheese and coffee.

And for the rest, old-fashioned wood picnic, the greatest of them all, the following is suggested: Fried chicken, brittle roll and baking powder biscuit, pickles, radishes, cream cheese half, currant tarts, home-made chocolate cake and coffee made over a camp fire.

Fashion Hint.

Fruits are as popular in flowers for the summer hat, grape and plums being used. In some instances even miniature oranges are placed on the hat. The cotton materials have been pushed to the background and new silks and serges are taking their places.

The misses' gowns are patterned after their mothers'. Embroidered tuiles and empire effects are favorites at the present time.

The mistress in the home often finds the care of fine linen one of her greatest difficulties. Some housekeepers have a separate drawer for the linen in the room and buy a heavy board on it when the cloth is stowed away. The linen which has been treated to a raw mixture of starch water and, when yet damp, ironed until the surface is a gloss, keeps twice as long as that which is shaken and tumbled. Napkins, although not he starched, although they sometimes take out a door
