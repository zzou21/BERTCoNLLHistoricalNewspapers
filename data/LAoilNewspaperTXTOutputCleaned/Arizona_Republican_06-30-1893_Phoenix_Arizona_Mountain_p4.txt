A PRIVATE SNAP.
Wool inspection law is a good one and as
useful in Maricopa county as any other county
in the territory. Phoenix Herald.
There is no doubt that the law is a
good one for the purpose for which it was
intended, namely, to meet a peculiar
evil which exists along the Mexico-
Arizona border and in the great range coun
tries. The Republican has
stated the circumstances under
which it was passed at the solicitation
of stockowners and stockmen in those
localities. Opposed to the objections of the
Maricopa county delegates which were
afterward withdrawn with the ex
planation that the law would not
operate in this county where
there is no such need of it than a neces
sity for a lightning rod or deep-sea harbor.
We believe there is a butcher or
stockman in the county who is in
favor of it and if neither of those classes
want it, pray, whom can it benefit but
the 2,030 stock inspector created by its
application in this county?
It is pretty generally believed that
the county has as many useful offices as
it can support and we have confidence
in the wisdom of the board of super
visors not to incur burden the people
have to provide a "private snap" for an offi
cial whose duties would be worse than
useless. We will not voluntarily
submit the question to representatives
in this county of the class and the only
class in whose interest the law was
framed the butchers and stockmen.
QUITE
SATISFACTORY.
Some objection is made to the
method pursued by the Lord High Ex
ecutioner of unleashing dogs in and for
the city of Phoenix. The objection lies
in the fact that the dogs are not on the
streets, or wherever they may happen
to be apprehended; that the execution
er, who is human, is liable to err in his
aim, and could not be expected to do the
work with the certainty of a machine.
That he may have missed a dog
now and then, is possible, but this can
not be imputed to him as a fault. It
must be remembered that the dogs are
unfamiliar with the operation of the
law under which the executioner acts.
Some allowance must be made for
the dogs which when they learn what
is expected of them will stand still and
take their medicine like hardened and
stoic criminals. And if at first some of
the dogs become nervous and are
embarrassed and the executioner's aim is
destroyed,
Aesthetic souls object because the
executioner permits the carcasses of his
victims to lie on the street. The ob
jectors forget that he is not a scavenger
whose business it is to drag away the
dead.
Hypercritical and unreasonable per
sons may be shocked by the presence of
a defunct dog, but just at this time
when rabies is rampant we believe the
average unmuzzled dog looks more love
ly in death than in the full possession
of his canine faculties and hydrophobic
possibilities. We can't have everything
the way we want it.
It is likely that Thomas Gates will
be appointed superintendent of the ter
ritorial prison. He seems to be the
choice of the majority of the people, is
well qualified, and Gov. Hughes could
not make a better selection.
MRS. THOMAS W.
The Wife of the President of the
World's Fair.
A Lady Who Honors of Her
Position Gracefully and Hospit
ably Her Interesting Fami
ly and Ancestry.
A woman doing her part in the great
work of the World's Columbian exposi
tion with great credit to herself and
the nation is Mrs. Thomas W. Palmer,
whose husband, ex-Senator Thomas W.
Palmer, has the position of president of the World's Columbian exposition.
Mrs. Palmer came from Maine, the
state which claims the statesman James
G. Blaine as its own, and she boasts
that the blood of Gov. Winthrop, of
Massachusetts, flows in her veins, as
well as that of the Winthrops and the
Sullivans, of Boston.
Mrs. Palmer's special work is to up
hold the dignity of her husband's posi
tion. She has traveled extensively and
has a list of acquaintances, second in
size, perhaps, to that of no other woman
now in Chicago. When Senator
Palmer was appointed minister to
Spain by President Harrison, Mrs.
Palmer accompanied him to that coun
try and kept open house in a manner
sufficiently delightful to impress the
idea of American hospitality indel
ibly upon the Spaniards' mind. And dur
ing her long term in Washington, as
the wife of the United States senator
from Michigan, she also entertained a
great deal.
Mrs. Palmer's maiden name was
Elizabeth Pitts Ingersoll. And, by the
oddest freak of fortune in the world,
her grandaunt, Elizabeth Pitts How
din, was also the wife of a minister to
Spain, being in that country in 1813
just eighty-five years before the pres
ent Mrs. Elizabeth Pitts Palmer went
there also as the wife of a minister to
Spain.
The brightest member of Mrs. Pal
mer's family, according to her ideas
and also those of the senator, is their
youngest child, Eugenio Poblacion y
Rolla Palmer, who is now 10 years
old. Eugenio was adopted in Spain,
while Mr. Palmer was minister
and by legislation he is now a legal
child of the Palmer family. He is a
handsome little fellow, very Spanish in
appearance, and is always dressed in
the costume of the children of his na
tive country.
At Saratoga last summer Eugenio was
much admired by the fashionable sum
mer guests assembled at that watering
place, and, as Mrs. Palmer declared, it
was absolutely necessary to leave Sara
toga, or Eugenio would become a little
profound enfant terrible long before his time.
Mrs. Palmer is a member of many so
cieties and clubs and is active in all
works, charitable and philanthropic,
of the fair.
Only One Thing.
Complaining Passenger: This train
makes abominably slow time. Can't
you persuade the engineer to get up a
little more steam?
Stoical Conductor: Time suits us. If
you are dissatisfied, get out and walk.
Complaining Passenger: I would like
to, but I wrote to my wife's folks to meet me at the
station, and it would be exasperating
to wait half a day for the train to get
in. Des Moines Argonaut.
A Pleasant Surprise.
"What a beautiful child!" exclaimed
Mrs. Intheswlm, pausing before a baby
carriage which a nurse was wheeling
through the park. "What a lovely
complexion! Your face is familiar to
me," she added, addressing the nurse;
"will you please tell me to whom the
child belongs?"
"Bless your heart, ma'am, she's your
own; but she's grown a great deal
since you saw her last." Press.

The Ohio Chemical Co.:

IMPORTANT NOTICE! The wonderful success of our Tablets
has caused many so-called cures to be placed on the market: most
of them are for the cure of TOBACCO HABIT, and the first requirement they make is that the patient
must quit using tobacco for from 30 to 90 days. This alone should
brand such remedies as frauds.
KILLS TABLETS destroy the desire for tobacco, and we
permit the patient to chew or smoke until such time as tobacco
is voluntarily given up.

A few testimonials by persons who have been cured with
The Ohio Chemical Co.:
GENTLEMEN: I have been using your cure for tobacco habit, and
found it would do what you claim for it. I used ten cents worth of
the strongest chewing tobacco a day and from one to five cigars or
I would smoke from ten to forty pipes of tobacco. Have chewed
and smoked for twenty-five years, and two packages of your Tablets cured me so that I have no desire for it now.
H. M. GAYLARD, Leslie, Mich.
The Ohio Chemical Co.:
GENTLEMEN:-Some time ago I sent for $1.00 worth of your
Tobacco Tablets for Tobacco Habit. I received them all right and, although
I was both a heavy smoker and chewer, they did the work in less
than three days. I am cured. Truly yours, W.
GENTLEMEN: It gives me pleasure to speak a word of praise
for your Tablets. My son was strongly addicted to the use of liquor
and through a friend I was led to try your Tablets. He was a heavy
and constant drinker, but after using your Tablets but three days he
quit drinking and will not touch liquor of any kind. I have waited
four months before writing you, in order to know the cure was permanent.
MISS HELEN MORRISON, Pittsburgh, Pa.
The Ohio Chemical Co.:
GENTLEMEN: I was addicted to morphine, hypodermically, for seven years and
have been cured by your Tablets. I used two packages of your Tablets, and without
any pain. L. LOTEUAY, Cincinnati, Ohio.
