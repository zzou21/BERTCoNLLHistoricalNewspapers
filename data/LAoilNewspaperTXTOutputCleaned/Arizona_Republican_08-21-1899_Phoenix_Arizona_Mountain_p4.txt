NEW CONCERN FOR PHOENIX
Plant Will Be Established for Pressing Oil from Olives.
The olive crop of the valley has been
sold to P. J. Grogan of Los Angeles
and the fruit will be pressed for oil.
It has been sold on the trees at a
good price and there will be a fairly
good crop. The olives last season
were pickled, but they are thought to
be more valuable this year for oil.

and this year it will not be
the same reason.

The habitat of the olive tree is in
a dry climate, and although of higher
altitude resembles this section in cli-
mate and soil. Scales cannot exist
here on account of the dry atmos-
phere, but in California they are a
great drawback both to olive and
orange trees.
A man thought he discovered scales
on trees here a few days ago. He re-
ferred the matter to a man who had
experience in such matters, who upon
examination declared the trees to be
free from the insects.

The intention is to treat the olives at a smaller size than other trees. They

ers concluded a few years ago that
the olive business was not lucrative,
and little attention has been paid to
the trees. More care has been shown
them this year than before and the
crop is heavier.
This section is so well adapted to
olive trees that they have thrived
without much care, and if properly
taken care of next season the crop
will be immense. The absence of
frosts and the dryness of the climate
here both aid the tree. The olive
crop in California last year was al
most destroyed on account of frost.

est olive growers in the country, who
owns orchards in California, was over

here last year. He visited the trees at
the experimental farm and declared
them to be the most magnificent spec-
imens he had ever seen.
The promise of an olive refinery
here next season will awaken a greater
amount of interest in olive culture.
Prof. A. J. McClatchie, director of the
experimental farm, says this valley is
one of the finest places in the world to
grow this fruit which is destined to

become an important factor in the
fruit industry."
Prof. McClatchie also says that the
eucalyptus is another tree which is be-
ing talked about. An article in the Re-
publican two weeks ago devoted much
space to the adaptability of this climate to

terest. Prof. McClatchie says he has
been interviewed by many farmers
about the particular variety of red gum
which he grows here successfully, and
a number of persons have said they
are going to plant trees. Notably
among them is B. A. Fowler who has
the Thompson ranch at Glendale. He
will plant two acres of eucalyptus trees
when the fall season opens. These
trees grow thriftily when planted very
close together and they are used prin-
cipally for wood and fence posts.

Encouraging reports also are coming
in of the orange crop. The yield this
year will be double that of last year
and the market price will be high.
THE WOLFRAM DEPOSITS

S. W. Traylor, representative of the

Colorado Iron Works, at Denver, is at

the Commercial. He has just made a

tour of the territory and was in Mex-
ico on business with the Cobre Grande

company. He says that improvements

will be made in the smelter and that al-
ready 100 tons of ore are smelted daily.
The ore averages about 14 percent.

Mr. Traylor says the Cobre Grande

mine shows the most prominent out-

croppings of any copper mine he has

ever seen. There is an iron cap about;

a mile broad at one place and it is more
than six miles in length. About three

miles of this cap runs through the Can-
tua mine of W. C. Greene. The
mine is being worked for the copper
ore, but Mr. Traylor says that the im-
mense quantity of almost pure iron
showing on the surface would mark
it a big iron property if there were no
copper.

The general indications of Cobre
Grande prompt Mr. Traylor to say that

the mine has prospects of developing
into one of the foremost producers in
the country. The extent of the Cobre
Grande's ore body has not yet been
shown, although a large amount of
development has been done. There is
only one shaft which has been sunk
to any great depth. It has pierced into
a deposit of sulphides which indicates a mine at that point. He says
deep shafts will be sunk along the out
croppings. The deposits at the base
may be iron or copper sulphides. In the
former instance the Cobre Grande will
not be as big a mine as he anticipates,
but the ore in single easily justifies the
smelter now at the mine. The carbon-
ate ores on the surface are slightly

richer than the sulphides, and there is
a big showing of surface ore. The de-
posit of sulphide ore is outlined to cor-
respond with the position of the gossan
cap and is in a contact of iron and
lime.
Mr. Traylor says preparations are
being made for the building of several
new smelters in the territory. This will
greatly increase Arizona's output of
copper. Tons of ore will be smelted
which could not be transported for
smelting at a profit and many new

mings, out of the saloon. They were

overtaken by Officer Clifford, who
placed his hands on Llewellyn's shoul-
der and said, "You are under arrest."
Llewellyn, who had his hand in his
blouse, drew his revolver and fired
three shots at Clifford, all of which
took effect in the region of the heart.
Llewellyn took to his heels and was
followed by Officer Griffiths and a citi-
zen on a bicycle. They gained on the
fugitive and upon reaching the Six-
teenth street viaduct, Llewellyn, hard

pressed, dodged under it. When he

emerged, Officer Griffiths sighted him

and fired three shots which were an-

swered by three by Llewellyn, the sec-
ond of which pierced Griffiths body
and he fell mortally wounded.
Llewellyn, in his flight, was fired at
several times by officers and he, or a
man, answering his description, was
finally caught by Officer Haines. The
prisoner was left in charge of a spe-
cial officer while Haines entered a pa-
trol box to call a police wagon, when
Llewellyn broke away from the spe-

cial officer and escaped, and on Tues-
day last had not been apprehended.
The excitement and indignation in the

tenderloin district, where the tragedy
occurred, was so great that had Llewel-
lyn been caught, he would, in all
probability, have been lynched.

Cummings, one of the soldiers who
were with Llewellyn, was well known

in Tempe, where he has always been

greatly respected.

RELIC OF BISHOP HOOPER.

Part of the Stake at Which He Was
Burned in Gloucester.

London, Aug. 20. An interesting
relic of the ill-fated Bishop Hooper is
to be sold tomorrow. It is a portion
of the stump cut from the stake at
which the bishop was burned in St.
Mary's square, Gloucester, in 1555, as

an obstinate and irreclaimable heretic.

The stake was taken up to make
room for the foundations of the pres-

ent monument. A greater part of the

stake was used in fashioning a casket

which was presented to the daughter

of Mayor Broughton of Gloucester on
the occasion of her marriage. All that

now remains of the stake is the part
which will be sold tomorrow.

Disturbing Incident at a Catholic Pro-

ade which preceded the dedication of

the new Roman Catholic Italian

Church of St. Anthony of Padua, in

Morris street, West Hoboken, today, a

roughly dressed man with a black

beard and wearing a slouch hat, at-

tracted the attention of bystanders at

West and Stevens streets by mutter-

ing to himself and acting in an ex-

cited manner.

When the procession came along he

man walked out to the carriage in

which was seated Bishop Wigger and
shaking his fist wildly at the bishop;

uttered several oaths. Then, he dis-
appeared in the crowd. The man's
voice could scarcely be heard above

the noise made by the procession and
Bishop Wigger gave but slight notice
to him. The parade was not inter-
rupted by the incident.

The Originator of

U coast home.

It was in a pasture belonging to
Wilfred A. Fiege, now at the Hebel
Adams, that the wolfram deposits were
found in the Dragoon mountains more
than a year ago. Wolfram rock may
be seen lying about on the surface at
this place and it had often occasioned
comment, but its character and value
were not known. A small wolfram
rock was carried about in the pockets
of a man living at Dragoon and he
showed it to a stranger who recognized
it. These two men took up a number of
claims. There was great excitement

over the discovery and many people
flocked in to take up locations. In
the shuffle Mr. Fiege managed to lo-
cate five claims. Wolfram is found at
various points within a strip two miles
long and one half mile wide at the
Dragoon summit, but no trace of it
appears elsewhere.
There are outcroppings of wolfram
rock at places along the sides of the
Dragoon mountains and in a creek op-

posite these a number of chloriders are

engaged. The bed of the creek has been
located and is leased to the chloriders
who are a great deal more prosperous
than the ordinary miner. The chlor-
ider digs only a few feet down the
stream's ledge where he finds pieces of
raw material from the size of a pea to

a hat. He seems to be wasting his
time on it, the small pieces of black rock,

but wolfram is a valuable metal and a

few pounds of it represents a good
The specific gravity is about 8 and a
sack full of the rock weighs many
pounds more than would be general.
The wolfram averages about seventy
percent tungsten oxide which is sold by
the chloriders for about 20 cents per
pound. The men average from thir-
ty to one hundred and fifty pounds of
the rock in a day. The plan of chlor-
iding in the stream was conceived by
a man who judged that the fragments
of rock which had been broken from
the outcroppings on the sides of the moun-
tains had been washed down to
the stream. His theory is certainly
correct because only at places in the
stream opposite the showings on the
mountains is the wolfram found.
The six claims located by the
original discoverers of the wolfram are
now owned by two companies which
will consolidate. There are about thir-
ty other claims taken up and a com-
pany is being formed which will do
the development work on them. This
company is backed by a rich New York
firm which is one of the few in the
United States to deal in wolfram.
The three companies propose to put in
a plant for concentrating the ore.

mines will be opened in regions where

the smelters are to be put up.

LLEWELLYN'S CRIME

Something of the Life Story of the
Soldier Murderer.

William Llewellyn commonly called "Jim" Llewellyn by his acquain-
tances here, was well and favorably
known in Globe, says the Silver Belt.
He came here first in 1890, with his
mother and two brothers. He worked
first for Dr. Alex Trippel at the Buf-
falo smelter, and afterwards for the
Old Dominion Copper company. He
was regarded as an industrious young
man, was not addicted to liquor and
was never quarrelsome, although he
possessed prowess as a boxer and was

an expert with pistol and rifle.

On one occasion he was watching
some acquaintances shooting with a
rifle at cans thrown in the air and de-

rided them for poor marksmanship.

Saying he would not attempt to shoot
if he could not make a better showing.
His skill being questioned, he accept-
ed the challenge to shoot with a pistol
at cans tossed in the air, he to pay two
dollars for every shot missed and re-
ceive 50 cents every time he hit a can.
The cans were tossed in a manner cal-
culated to puzzle a professional shot,

yet he perforated them with ease,
never missing, until his challengers
became tired of the game. At Denver
on the night of the killing he said to
his comrades he would soon be in the
sharpshooter class of his regiment,
and to prove his claim was not boast-
ful he entered a shooting gallery with
the party, and selecting the smallest
target he sent a bullet through the
bull's eye, and the second shot split

the rim of the central spot.
The Llewellyn family left Globe
about three years ago, and nothing
was heard of "Jim" until he returned
here last December. His mother died
after leaving here; one brother lives in
Indian Territory and another is in the
banking business in Comanchetown,
Texas. He told friends here he was
one of the Cuban filibustering party
on the steamer Three Friends, captur-
ed by the United States cruiser Marble
head. After the war with Spain broke
out he enlisted and went to Cuba, and
after the fall of Santiago did police

duty there.
It is probable that the reckless life
of a filibuster and familiarity with the
dangers of a soldier's life developed in
him the latent spirit of the daredevil
which led him to the commission of so
heinous a crime.
Speaking of the killing the Denver
News says:
The trouble originated in a saloon
where Llewellyn, and two companions
were drinking. A dispute arose over

the payment for drinks and while
Llewellyn and the bartender were en-
gaged in an altercation a negro porter
attempted to strike Llewellyn with a
coke-jack. The latter drew a revolver
from his blouse but was prevented
from using it by a soldier named Bry-
ant. The revolver fell to the floor.

Maltese Fought Fifteen Minutes and
Finished One Reptile.

Great Neck, L. I., Aug. 20. A lively
battle was witnessed here this morn
ing between a big Maltese cat owned
by Edward Reilly, and a large black
snake which the cat found sunning it-
self in the New road. The cat cir-
cled around the snake several times,
seeking a favorable opportunity to

land on it, but the snake was alert.
Finally the cat thrashed about in the

roadway and rolled over in the dust.

The cat fastened her jaws about the
middle of the snake's back and hung
on while the snake coiled around her
body. The fight lasted fifteen minutes,
and at its end the cat dragged the dead
snake across the road, and then sat
down and cleaned herself.

LABORI'S WIFE AN ENGLISH GIRL

Sixteen-Year-Old Hamilton Smith Fell
Descending the Otemma.

It is odd to see an Indian chief patronize
the peanut and lemonade stands, and
sit unmoved at the performance, and
yet stand enthralled before the cages
of animals unknown on his native
prairies. The bride and the bride-
groom spent three or four days in the
town, wandering about as unconsciously
as Adam and Eve in the garden.
The man was already masterful and
protecting, the girl shy and subser-
vient. Day after day they walked
in and in hand, looking at every-
thing, people, shops, cattle, but never "speak-
ing to anyone, never even to each other
yet deeply content in the consciousness of companionship. They were a
living example of the happiness of
simplicity, and while they stayed in
the hustling town, made many a civ-
ilized man and woman think of how
far their own conduct as wives and
husbands fell short of the standard of
this unconscious Indian pair." Ains

CLEVER WAY TO CATCH A THIEF

Berne, Aug. 20. News has been re-

English tourist, Hamilton Smith, 18
years old. Young Smith, accompanied
by the Rev. Mr. Graham, and other
English tourists, ascended the Otem-
ma, on the Italian frontier, without a

His body was picked up at the foot
of the mountain, terribly crushed and
mangled. He was an only son. His
