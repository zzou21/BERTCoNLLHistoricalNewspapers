GOLF CHAMPION DEFEATED

Associated Press Dispatch
CHICAGO, July 25. Charles Evans,
Jr., the present western champion, was
defeated in the third round of the
Western Golf association champion
ship tournament yesterday by E. P.
Allis of Milwaukee. The elimination of
Evans was the feature of the day's
play in the third round at the Home
wood club. The champion who was
runner up and medallist in the na
tional championship last year, was
defeated chiefly on account of con
sistent putting by Allis, who is a
comparatively new man in tournament
play.

CLOSING DAYS
(Continued from Page One)

leaves here about noon Sunday.
This afternoon was made more
dramatic as officers could be directed to the main
conspirator. Richey continued de
sperately trying to keep the postal
and police officers on Collins' trail,
wiring full details of the probable
visits of the plotter each day ahead
of his letters to "Oury." By thus
juggling his letters to Collins and
his wires to the officers, he finally
managed to work the two into close
proximity one day, and the capture
resulted.
In order to keep up the game,
Richey wrote Collins asking for more
commission than was agreed upon in
the original negotiations. In his
eagerness to get the plot executed,
Collins wrote the Valley bank in
structing it to pay this commission,
and signed the name, Oury. His de
posits in the Securities Bank and
Trust company were to have covered
his draft. But on Richey's direction,
the Valley bank refused to treat with
"Oury," saying the draft and the in
structions must come through the
Securities company in order that there
could be no doubt as to the identity
of the sender and that of the signer
of the deed.
Here is where Collins' foxiness re
ceived its final test and broke. He
signed a check to the credit of one
Scott, using the name "Oury." He
then went to the bank in Oakland
and presented the check, asking that
the money be sent to Jacobs in Phoe
nix to be his commission for a "cer
tain real estate transaction." This
satisfied the bank authorities of the
identity of "Scott," and they had
him taken by the officers, lying in
wait on Richey's instruction. This
arrest occurred day before yesterday.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Under and by virtue of the order made

in the matter of the petition of J. W.

Today Colonel Tuthill replied to
the letter received a day or two ago
from Governor Hunt, appreciative of
his visit to the encampment earlier
in the week. Tuthill's letter follows:
CAMP HUNT, July 25.
From Commanding Officer, First In
fantry, N. G. Arizona.
To Governor George W. P. Hunt,
Commander-in-Chief, N. G. Arizona.
It is with the greatest pleasure that
I acknowledge the receipt of your
letter with its warm words of com
mendation for the regiment and the
S. I. S. band.
The suggestion of yourself that the
State Industrial School band camp
with us has proved a most happy
one. Their music is excellent and
their conduct above reproach. Under
the leadership of their efficient band
master, Mr. Carl Gung'l, their ser
vices have been very satisfactory.
Never have I seen more well behav
ed, courteous, little gentlemen, than
than those composing the Arizona
State Industrial School band.
It is a great satisfaction to the of
ficers and men of the First regiment
infantry, N. G. Arizona, to feel that
while our citizens in general are slow
ly awakening to the need of a train
ed force of state troops, that may in
time of national danger be merged
with the regular army to form a
homogeneous body of offense and de
fense, our chief executive is keenly
aware of this need and is ready and
willing to do all in his power to help
this preparation to the end that when
this time comes the First Arizona in
fantry will be so trained that it will
be able to acquit itself so honorably
that additional luster will be brought
to the forty-eighth star.
A. M. TUTHILL,
Colonel, First Regiment, National
Guard of Arizona.

The boys of the various companies
are looking forward to one event of
tomorrow that is of more than pass
ing interest. A competitive drill is to
be held between the various compa
nies of the regiment, with a hand
some flag, designed and made by
Mrs. LaGarde; wife of First Lieuten
ant R. D. LaGarde, U. S. A., detail
ed to Arizona as inspector-instructor
of the troops. It is a handsome silk
banner, with gold fringe and gold
letters, bearing the words, "First
Infantry, Arizona National Guard."
It will be placed in the hands of
the company making the best show
ing at the drill. It will be held by
the winning company and will pass
on to another company next year,
unless the holding company retains it
through meritorious work next year.
Because of this little recognition at
the hands of Mrs. LaGarde, she has
been styled the "Betsy Ross of the
Arizona National Guard."
The boys of the band appeared this
afternoon in their pretty white uni
forms and presented a handsome ap
pearance. That they were proud goes
without saying.

penitentiary,' a man over whom a five
year sentence is now hanging. He
also gave up the names of his accom
plices, Maria Bressa, the leader and
brains of the gang, and Louis Schia
fino and Louis Savio. The latter three
are, at last word from San Francisco,
being sought by the police, with good
chances they will be taken soon.
Walter Bennett, when interviewed
last night was utterly astonished at
the news. He said he was owner of
the quarter block on the northwest
corner of Fourth and Adams streets,
a block west of the board of trade,
the quarter block adjoining on the
west being the property of Mrs. Jack
son, held in administration for her by
Judge Kibbey, acting for the Oury
estate. "That land is worth between
forty and fifty thousand dollars, and
if I had heard it offered for ten or
eleven thousand, I would have known
instantly there was something wrong.
I am mighty glad the swindle has
been exposed, and I will be exceed
ingly interested in reading your ac
count in The Republican tomorrow
morning."
Richey, Lewis and Jacobs, of all the
multitude of real estate men and at
torneys in the west, approached with
the shady deals of "Collins" entered
the game with serious intention of
uncovering the fraud. Phoenix was
the only town that responded one way
or another to the letters sent out by
the sharpers. And as a result the
cleverest of plots and the smoothest of
crooks are now known to the San
Francisco officers.
