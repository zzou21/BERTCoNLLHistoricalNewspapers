FORMER CONVICT,
W MOVIE
VISITS JKE CITY
Al Jennings of Oklahoma
-Spends Several Hours Here
on Way to Coast to Appear
in Screen Pictures,
Al Jennings, lawyer, former bandit,
bank robber, ex-convict and politician,
was an Albuquerque visitor yesterday.
While Mr. Jennings was delighted to
spend several hours in the Duke city,
his stay was not voluntary on his part.
He was a passenger on the California
limited and the train was held here
for several hours, owing to the wash
outs on the Santa Fe in Arizona.
Mr. Jennings was on his way to Los
Angeles, accompanied by three assistants where he will play the leading
part in a series of movie films for the
Capital Film company. The first pic
ture in which he appeared was re
leased July 28. He is under contract to
appear in twenty-four pictures, most
of them dealing with episodes in his
life.
Asked how he came to turn bandit,
Mr. Jennings said he was practicing
law at Ft. Reno several years ago. One
night a Santa Fe train was held up
and robbed at Norman, Okla. Not
withstanding the fact that he was not
within a hundred miles of Norman
when the holdup occurred, he was ac
cused of the crime. The case was a
frame-up," he said, but as soon as he
learned what was brewing he made
his escape. The next morning he went
to a little country store in the Creek
nation to buy some cheese and crack
ers to satisfy his hunger. When he
came out of the store he mounted his
horse to ride away, when five or six
men whom he noticed on the porch of
the store, fired a shot at the propri
etor.
Old Resident Near Death
"I had not eaten food for 10 days
and was slowly starving to death.
Given up by five doctors, I tried a
bottle of Mayr's Wonderful Remedy,
which gave relief at once. I am 70
years old and would have died but
for your wonderful medicine. The
Jaundice is all gone and I am gaining
appetite and strength every day." It
is a simple, harmless preparation that
removes the catarrhal mucus from the
intestinal tract and allays the inflam
mation which causes practically all
stomach, liver and intestinal ailments,
including appendicitis. One dose will
convince or money refunded. Adv.

were officers sent out to capture him.

One shot passed through his horse,
killing the animal, also punctured the
stirrup leather and lodged in Jen
nings' left ankle. Jennings said he re
turned the fire, killed two of the of
ficers, and the others fled.
Jennings said he then rushed into
the store, fired a shot at the propri
etor, but missed him, grabbed $27.50
out of the cash drawer and escaped
"That was the first crime I ever com
mitted." he said. That night he joined
a bandit gang, five days later they
robbed a Katy train, and continued
their carnival of crime for some years.
Once in Galveston he was attending
a fancy dress ball. At that time there
was a reward of $10,000 hanging over
his head. The building in which the
ball was being held was surrounded
by officers. Jennings received a tip
of what was going on and managed to
escape, clad in his dress suit. He
made his way to the water front and
boarded the first steamer he came to,
which proved to be a tramp bound
for Honduras. But Jennings didn't
care. The only business before the
meeting then was to get away from
Galveston. He landed in Honduras,
where he met O. Henry, also a fugitive
from justice.
After spending some time in Hon
duras, Jennings returned to Okla
homa, and gave himself up. He was
convicted of train robbing and sen
tenced to serve a life term in the
penitentiary at Columbus, O. Presi
dent McKinley commuted his term to
five years and President Roosevelt
granted him a pardon and restored
him to full citizenship.
"Strange as it may seem," said
Jennings in discussing the circum
stances leading up to his conviction,
"I was tried for 17 offenses, and I
was guilty of every one of them. But
I was acquitted. I was convicted on
the only two charges of which I was
not guilty."
Jennings returned to Oklahoma and
immediately entered politics. In 1910
he was a candidate for district attor
ney in Oklahoma county, but was
"counted out." he said. In 1913 he
was a candidate for the gubernatorial
nomination, but was defeated.
"Folks thought it would not look
right to have an ex-convict in the
governor's chair," he said. "I told
them that several men who had been
governor of Oklahoma ought to have
been in the penitentiary."
Mr. Jennings does not look like an
outlaw. He is slightly below the av
erage in height, possesses a wealth of
wavy brown hair and his blue eyes
look straight at you when he is talk
ing. He might easily be taken for a
prosperous business or professional
man, but no one would pick him out
as a man who had been chased all
over Oklahoma and adjoining states
by officers of the law, been wounded
by flying bullets and served a term
in prison.
"Are you married?" Mr. Jennings
was asked.
"Yes, I have a wife and three chil-
dren." he replied. "My family
lives in Los Angeles.
Mr. Jennings said he might return
to Albuquerque in the near future and
film three or four pictures. "This
does not mean that I contemplate lo
cating here," he added. "But we may
come here to get the proper stage
settings."
While Mr. Jennings' pictures deal
mainly with his life as an outlaw, he
has woven through them the idea
that crookedness doesn't pay. His
purpose, he said, is to teach the youth
of the country that uprightness and
honesty are desirable above all things.
FORMER ALBUQUERQUE
MAN IS INTERESTED
IN HUGE OIL DEAL
A short time ago Henry Lockhart
Jr., former resident of this city, now a
New York banker and oil magnate, drop-
ped in here a day continued on to Los Angeles. His
mission to Los Angeles was exceed
ingly important, as the following
clipping from the Express of that city
would indicate:
"A gigantic association of oil In-
terests, rivaling the world position of
the Standard Oil company and rep
resenting invested capital of more
than $500,000,000, is foreshadowed by
the announcement in Los Angeles
that a partnership interest in the
Union Oil company of California has
been purchased by a big eastern syn
dicate. This syndicate is headed by Chas.
H. Sabin, president of the Guaranty
Trust company of New York; Henry
Lockhart Jr., New York banker and
oil man, and Percy Rockefeller of
New York.
"Purchase of a partnership in the
Union Oil company, said to represent
an initial outlay of approximately
$20,000,000 by the syndicate headed
by Mr. Sabin, Mr. Lockhart and Mr.
Rockefeller, came as a result of ne
gotiations opened in Los Angeles two
months ago by Mr. Lockhart, who
came here at the instance of W. U
Stewart, president of the California
company.
"Prominent oil men here asserted
today that this big deal is nicely
the forerunner of a great 'oil era' in
which many of the larger oil com,
panies in this country will form an
association for the first time in his
tory large enough to actually rival
the Standard Oil company.
"It is intimated that E. U. Doheny
and his business associates, who rep
resent a controlling interest in largn
oil producing regions in this country
and abroad, may align themselves
with the organization now in process
of formation."
SANTA FE SHOPMEN IN
ALBUQUERQUE NOT TO
STRIKE, SAY LEADERS
Following a meeting of the local
shop craft yesterday afternoon, it
was announced that there would be
no strike of the Santa Fe shopmen
here, in line with the action taken at
Chicago Friday, but that instructions
would be awaited from the Interna
tional Crafts of Shopmen. Repre
sentatives of this organization have
been in Washington for several days
conferring with Director General
Hines regarding working conditions
and wages, it is believed that an
amicable adjustment of the differ
ences will be made.
The Santa Fe is not affected by the strike, and is not
likely to be.
"TOUROMANIA" GRIPPING
THE UNITED STATES
Reports from every section of the
country showing the "touring bee" is
rampant, and even the remotest sec
tions that never boasted much auto
mobile touring report the arrival of
scores of motor caravans.
This is the gist of a report issued by
the national touring bureau of the
B. F. Goodrich Rubber company
which says that the average citizen
who seldom before thought of long
tours is being seized with the 'long
distance fever.' It is an after-the-war
relation a desire for people to forget
the war and rest their work of rear
ranging business affairs to fit recon
struction needs held thousands of bus
iness men to their work.
The second big factor contributing
to the vast scope of motor travel is
that the bars of European travel are
still up. England and France have an
nounced that foreign visitors will not
be admitted probably until next year
The Goodrich bureau has been
swamped with requests for state road
maps. They will give out nearly
5,000,000 state highway maps this
year. This is almost the equivalent of
one map to each and every car owner
in America were they distributed on
the basis of one state man to an auto
mobile owner. Requests have been
heavier than ever before by a wide
margin, and have increased with each
week during the summer months. The
peak will probably be reached during
the latter part of August.
It is estimated that over 75 per cent
of the cross-country tours are made
on improved roads, which represent a
total of less than 20 per cent of the
nation's highway system. When the
enormous appropriations for highways
have been expended and the car own
er and motor truck operator is offered
a wider range of activity, utilization
of the roads will amount to almost
unbelievable proportions. Not only
more improved roads but wider roads
will be needed to avoid congestion of
traffic.
DEMOBILIZATION IS
PROCEEDING RAPIDLY
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2. Figures made
public today by the war department
showed that 3,113,120 officers and
men had been discharged from the
army up to July 29 and that the
number brought back from Europe
on that date was 1,78,275.
The strength of the army on that
date was 612,708, including 91,630
voluntary enlistments since the ar
mistice was signed.
Of the 612,000 men, 156,270 were
in Europe on July 29, 67,680 at sea
and the remainder at home or on
other stations.
PROFITEERING MUST "
CEASE, SAYS LOWDEN
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2. Governor Frank
O. Lowden, of Illinois, in a statement
today, declared that there can be no
lasting relief from the prevailing In
dustrial unrest until the high cost of
living problem has been solved. The
question, he said, must be solved by
the federal government without delay
if national disaster is to be averted.
He urged the producer, business
man, and worker to co-operate in ob
taining relief from food profiteering,
even if it means financial loss to
overly individual.

SERVICE IN MEMORY
OF JOSIAH F. REED
TO BE HELD TONIGHT
A service in memory of Josiah F.
Reed will be held at the Congrega

tional church this evening at 8:15
o'clock. It is
eminently fitting that
more than a passing tribute should
be paid to one who manifested a
spirit of devotion to the public good
which all would do well to emulate.
During his brief stay in the city he
not only showed a deep interest in all
that tended to its betterment, but al
so gave himself unstintedly to needed
tasks.
At the meeting this evening tribute
will be given by those who knew him
intimately. Many will be thrilled by
an opportunity of attending such a ser-
vice.

STORAGE BATTERY
If everybody said "Threaded Rubber
Insulation" when they bought batteries
and saw to it that "Threaded Rubber" was
what they got there would be a lot less
battery grief.
Far fewer jobs of reinsulation that
is so often necessary to get full life out of
the plates of an ordinary battery.
Assurance of longer battery life.
If your battery is getting to the point
where it shows signs of quitting it will
pay you to get on the track of Threaded
Rubber. Come in any time and have a
talk about batteries.
