MISSIONS

IN COUNTRY

ATTRACTS TOURISTS TO STATE

Two Arizonans know that the two
oldest missions in the country are situated within the confines of their own
State," said C. H. Howard, manager
local B. F. Goodrich Rubber company.
"The new state highway between
Tucson and Nogales, which passes
near both of them, will undoubtedly
arouse a new interest in the historical
landmarks.

"Nine miles out of Tucson, one finds San Xavier del Bac, the
oldest of the two. About forty miles
farther, (three miles south of Tubac)
is the Mission of Tumacacori.

"No definite information regarding
the history of Tumacacori Mission has
ever been found. As far as can be
learned, it was founded by a Father
Kino and associates sometime between
1700 and 1732. Mention has been
found of the fact that Fray Gil De Bernave was the priest in charge during 1761. There is also evidence of
numerous Apache attacks on the Mis
sion from 1752 to 1770.

Of Moorish Architecture

"Although not as pretentious as San
Xavier, Tumacacori Mission is also a
splendid example of Moorish archi
tecture. "The walls are of adobe, with brick
trimmings on all cornices. A little stucco
still clings to the walls of the struct
ure, but the whole building is rapidly
deteriorating into a shapeless mass of
ruins. Unless Arizonans awaken to
the fact and take steps to preserve it,
the second finest mission of the Span
ish period will soon be nothing but a
memory.

"The building seems to have been a
combined fortress and church, as three
sides of it are surrounded by high
walls, in which there are numerous
loop holes.
"Large bullet holes in the walls are
explained by stories of the executions
of rebellious Indians. Tumacacori, too,
has its familiar legend of buried
treasure, but repeated excavations
have failed to locate any signs of the $200,000 in gold which was purported
to have been hidden under the walls
of the church.
"A party of friends touring Arizona,
recently visited the two missions on
the Tucson-Nogales road. They are
as enthusiastic in their report of the
new highway as in the performance of
Goodrich tires on the wheels of their
Overland. Only once did they find it
necessary to stop on account of their
tires, and that was when a ten penny
nail became a little too friendly."

PHOENIX-L. A. ROAD
O. L. McMackin who recently
made the trip from Phoenix to
Los Angeles writes the Phoenix
chamber of commerce that the road
from Phoenix to Bouse by way of
Buckeye is in fair condition, and
that from Bouse to Needles by way
of Parker the sand is a little heavy.
He says the rivers are all dry, the
roads good and the signs ex-

The factory drive-aways, now so
common, have produced some spectacu
lar demonstrations of motor car ef
ficiency. Reports from Liberty dealers, who have driven away great num
bers of cars within the past few weeks,
are filled with interesting incidents of
Liberty performance and descriptions
of the unusual feats of Liberty cars
under all sorts of road conditions.
One dealer who, with a number of
guests, drove eight cars to Newark, N.
J., a distance of nearly eight hundred
miles, had this to say of his experience on a particular road en route: "You
can appreciate how disheartened we
felt when we saw sixteen cars of a
well-known make stuck with mud and
water almost to the tops of their
wheels. After carefully inspecting the
road and sizing up the situation, we
were of one opinion, and that was that
the Liberty cars would drive around
the cars that were submerged. As I
was driving the pilot car, I made the
attempt, and experienced the pleasure
of witnessing one of the finest demon
strations of a motor car that I have
ever seen. Without apparently any
strain on the motor whatever, or doing
any damage to our cars, we succeeded
in passing the entire sixteen."
Roads Nearly Impassable

An owner who accompanied the
Brooklyn, N. Y., dealer to the factory
and drove his own car home wrote that
"The road conditions were nearly
impassable. Approximately three hun
dred miles were of snow with deep
ruts where at times my radiator was
throwing snow like a plow. The mud
seemed unconquerable. Ice caused us
worry. But nevertheless we raced
and crawled with just one speed high.
My car was one of six and all six be
haved alike.

Although Liberty cars have been a
hundred miles distant from the factory,
and drive-aways have been conducted
for months almost without interrup
tion, not one Liberty car has been re
ported stuck on the road nor has
there yet been any mention of me
chanical difficulty of any kind.
WAR AND THE TIRE

INDUSTRY IS TOPIC

Recently before a body of leading tire
dealers, Frank C. Millhoff, sales man
ager of the Miller Rubber company,
Akron, Ohio, used for his theme "War
and the Tire Industry." Among other
phases he discussed the direct effect
that wartime conditions have had upon
the quality of tires.
The war, undeniably, is making better
men and women of all of us. We
are making everything go the farthest
and we are doing everything that we
do the best we know how. The product
of industries must then be lifted
higher in quality provided, of course,
that quality is really being striven for.
But the problem of tire manufacturers
has been vitally more than good fabric
and good rubber and ample knowledge
of tire making methods. It has been a
problem of men.
Tires Vary In Mileage
Several years ago we discovered that
tires vary in mileage about as the men
building them differ in their work.

Eliminate these variations in vital
operations and we should have uni
formity in making and uniform mile
age from the tires out on the road. We
put ourselves to the task of training
men to be uniform. We kept scientific
records. Those who could finally pass
the test remained. Those who could
not were sent elsewhere. And so today, only picked squads build Miller
tires. Their average personal ef
ficiency is 96 per cent. Of all the tires
they build less than 1 per cent ever
calls for adjustment.
And the war has made us conscious
that the field has grown narrow from
which to pick men and train them.
Only exceptional men will do. Even
today only about one motorist in fifty
can be supplied with Miller tires. But
we propose to go on just the same and
though we may not be able to increase
our output in proportion to the demand
for Miller tires, we shall have the sat
isfaction of knowing that every tire
that we build is uniformly built and
consequently will give uniform and
maximum mileage.
o

With freight equipment scarce, and
with everyone determined to give the
government absolute right of way on
our railroads, automobile drive-aways
are the rule instead of the exception.
Not only are these drive-aways being
conducted by groups of dealers, but
prospective owners find it pleasant to
make up a party and come to Detroit
and drive away their own cars.

It would seem timely, then, to give
a few simple instructions to these ama
teur pilots, some of whom have had
very little experience in driving at all,
and most of whom have had no ex
tensive experience in cross-country
driving over strange roads, especially
in parties or squads. These sugges
tions are drawn from the experience of
the Hupp Motor Car corporation in
supervising scores of drive-aways in the
last two months.
Each Driver Should Know

First, as to the car itself. Regard
less of the rigid inspection given cars
before they leave the factory, each
driver should assure himself by per
sonal inspection that the crank case
is filled with lubricating oil, the gaso
line tank filled with fuel, the radiator
filled with water, and the tires prop
erly inflated. If the motor is a type
that lubricates under pressure, he
should see that the oil gauge is regis
tering properly. If the car carries a
reserve compartment in the gasoline
tank, as all cars should, the driver
should make sure that he is not driv
ing on the reserve when he starts out.
Once on the road, the driver should
rigidly refrain from driving faster than
twenty miles per hour for the first two
hundred miles, and faster than thirty
miles an hour thereafter until at least
the five hundredth mile. Nothing will
ruin a motor quicker than driving it
at excessive speeds when new.
One Chosen Leader

If there is a party driving away, one
driver, preferably the most experi
enced, should be chosen as the leader,
and, after the route has been deter
mined, the other drivers should follow
this driver conscientiously, cars in
line should be driven in sight of each
other, especially where there are many
forks and turns in the road likely to
lead stragglers astray. A few moments
spent in waiting for the car behind at
such points save hours spent in locat
ing lost members of the party. Many
pilots find that it saves time to carry
a bag of confetti to be scattered along
the right road at doubtful points. At
night a ball of waste, soaked in keros
ene, lighted and thrown in the middle
of the road, serves the same purpose.

If possible, in every drive-away
party there should be one mechanic. In large parties, the expert
should have nothing to do but ride in
one car after another throughout the
trip. Frequently he can make on the
spot minor adjustments which, if neg
lected, might lead to serious trouble.
Every driver should be on the lookout
for any unusual behavior in his car or
its motor. Upon the appearance of
anything of this kind he should imme
diately stop and see that the attention
of the mechanic is called to it and
trouble corrected before proceeding.
Adds to Pleasure of Trip

It adds to the pleasure of a drive
away if, as far as possible, the dis
tance to be covered each day is pre
determined and arrangements made by
telegraph for accommodations at the
end of each day's run.

There are many other things which a
pilot in a drive-away will pick up as
his experience increases, but the sug
gestions given above are the most im
portant, and, if carefully heeded, will
make drive-aways not only pleasant
but actually beneficial to the cars
thus driven.

BUYERS MORE EXACTING

"With the war developing new
transportation problems, the discrim
ination of motor truck buyers is be
coming more exacting," says H. W.
Nerney of the Kissel Kar.

"Realizing that their haulage and
delivery requirements are more di
versified, as well as intensified, the
three truck essentials purchasers first
to make sure of to meet them are, abundant strength in all vital parts to stand
up under the strain of continuous
usage, unlimited power to ensure un
interrupted performance and economy
of operation in proportion to services
rendered."

Do not wait till tomorrow phone
that WANT AD, to The Republican
and dispose of, or get what you want.

PASSENGER CARS GO

WITH TRUCK TRAINS

The sight of long trains of olive
drab motor trucks leaving Detroit for
the Atlantic seaboard is rapidly be
coming a familiar sight; for it is now
a daily occurrence. Each truck train
is accompanied by a smaller train of
passenger cars.

In the middle of last winter, truck
makers in Detroit began the delivery
of war trucks over the snow-covered
roads. Though the government itself
is the purchaser of the trucks, it was
impossible to secure enough freight
cars to ship the daily scheduled pro
duction. In spite of all the road diffi
culties of the severest winter on rec
ord, the road delivery was successful
and has been continued, until now two
companies of soldiers drive away 60
trucks a day. Six Dodge Brothers
cars go along with each truck train,
also destined for service overseas.
The plan of driving the huge war
trucks overland is a success, not only
from the standpoint of getting the ve
hicles to their destination regularly
and promptly, but also from the stand
point of transportation of war materi
als of all sorts on each trip to the At
lantic ports. The railroads are re
lieved of the task of carrying much
tonnage and munitions are reaching
their seaboard shipping points in a
steady stream.

A PROPHECY IS OUT
We Lead! To Lead—Is To Be Followed
To be Copied to be Imitated is the Sincerest Flattery
Watch Well the Future for the Fulfillment of this Prophecy

Kimble Brothers who have
mining interests at Dos Cabezas,
have recently purchased a West
ern engine for their property.
This engine is reported to be a
16-horsepower machine of the
standard type manufactured by
the Western Machinery company
of Los Angeles, and operates on
a very low grade of oil.
There are a number of Western
engines in operation in the mines
throughout the state and this
equipment is building quite a
name locally. The Western com
pany manufactures five types of
engines ranging in size from 12
horsepower to 320 horsepower.

What Concerns You Most
FIRST The Grafinite Tube cannot stick to the inside of
the casings in which it is used, and we guarantee that it
will not. No other tube is or can be made that possesses
the non-stick feature of the Grafinite Tube.
SECOND No soapstone or other tire powder is neces
sary when Grafinite Tubes are used, as the Grafinite Tube
is coated with graphite that
cannot wear or rub off.

THIRD Because of its
graphite coating, our tube
does give longer and more
satisfactory service, but it
costs no more than other
tubes. Others may try to fol
low where we lead, but no
other company can make
tubes like the Grafinite Tube.
Why Graphite?
Graphite, as a coating for
the Savage Tube, was de
cided upon because it, of all
elements of earth, is the very
best for preventing friction
and sticking. It does not af
fect rubber in any way. It
does only what it is intended
to do—prevent friction and
sticking and keep the tube
from drying out. We had our
choice of everything and se
lected graphite, because no
other substance will serve so
well the purpose that graph
ite serves as a coating for in
ner tubes.

Soapstone Does Not
Prevent Sticking
Most tubes discarded as worn
out are not really worn out, but
are rendered worthless by stick
ing, friction and the consequent heating. Soapstone and other
tire powders help a little, but they do not prevent sticking and
friction. The graphite coating on the Savage Tube is the only
thing that does.
Make an examination right now and you will likely find your
tubes sticking to the inside of your casings, if you are not using
Grafinite Tubes. Grafinite Tubes cannot stick. Use them and
completely eliminate sticking, friction and heating.

Our Process Patented
We own and control basic patents covering our secret
process of impregnating with and vulcanizing graphite
into the surface of rubber inner tubes. Other companies
would be glad to manufacture graphite coated tubes, but
because of our patents they cannot do so without our
permission; which, of course, they cannot secure.
Excellent Every Way

Not considering the big advan
tage of its graphite coating, the
Grafinite Tube is unsurpassed by
any inner tube manufactured.
The materials of which it is
made are the best that can be had.
A considerable premium
over market prices is paid for
the exceptionally high-grade
rubber used in its manufacture.
The Grafinite Tube is a laminated
tube that is, it is built up
of several layers of rubber. The
splice laps are unusually long.
The tube is a true round at the
splice. In short, the Grafinite
Tube has all the good features
of other good tubes plus its dis
tinctive graphite coating.
In addition to our guarantee that
the Savage Tube will not stick
to the inside of any dry casing
in which it may be used, the
Savage Grafinite Tube is abso
lutely guaranteed for life against
all defects in material and work
manship. Savage Tires
Like Grafinite Tubes, Savage
Tires are built throughout of
high-quality materials. Recent
improved manufacturing and in
spection methods enable us to
offer you better tires than we
have ever offered before. Savage
Tire equipment, inside and out,
will give you "Heap big mile
age" and maximum satisfaction.
Savage Service
We are prepared to render to
you an efficient, courteous, un
limited tire service, whether you
now use our products or not. If
you have not received a copy of
the Savage Service Creed, write
or call for a copy and check us
up on service.
Our aim is to give you perfect service. If you receive anything
short of this, it will be a favor if you will write to the Service
Inspector at our Home Office, and we promise to correct the
matter if it is possible to do so.
