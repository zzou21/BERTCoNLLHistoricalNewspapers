teems with trout and bonytail; con
sequently their larder was always well
supplied. On the trip north they
stopped at the Gowam & Pranty and
Azbill brothers mining claims on up
per Gun creek, which are very good
copper prospects, the ore carrying per
centages of gold and silver. These
claims have been bonded to Winslow
parties, who last week sent in four
teams with men and supplies to do de
velopment work. On their return the
Messrs. Williamson and Arhelger vis
ited the lower Gun creek camp, where
the principal claims are owned by Bob
Schell and son and Harvey Morris.
The claims have been opened by tun
nels and shafts (the deepest shaft
about forty-five feet) showing very
good ore. The ledges are well defined
contact veins, with plenty of iron and
lime. Some of these claims have been
bonded to Frank H. Trego, who is
working a force of eight or ten men.

The Winslow people are

after the trade of the Gun creek dis
trict and are making an effort to have
a wagon road built to the mines, a
distance of about 100 miles.

George Schammel, accompanied by
the Messrs. Bishop, two mining men,
passed through Jerome Monday on
their way to Camp Verde, where they
went to look at some properties in the
Squaw Peak district. There are some
good copper prospects there that are
worthy the attention of mine operat
ors. Jerome News.
A miner and assayer, who has been
over the Mingus group of copper mines
writes as follows regarding that prop
erty for the Jerome News: "This
group adjoins the ground of the Cop
per Chief Mining company on the
south and comprises eight full claims,
four of which extend across Little Oak
creek, which upon these claims runs a
good flow of water the year round.
There is also a large amount of tim
ber growing along Little Oak creek
upon the ground covered by the Min
gus group suitable for mine timbers
and fuel. The Mingus group crops
upon the ground covered by the Cop
per Chief group about forty feet in
width, showing well in copper and also
carrying large quantities of gold and
silver of appreciable quantity. A small
lot of ore from the Mingus group can
be seen in the office of

Charles M. Clark.
