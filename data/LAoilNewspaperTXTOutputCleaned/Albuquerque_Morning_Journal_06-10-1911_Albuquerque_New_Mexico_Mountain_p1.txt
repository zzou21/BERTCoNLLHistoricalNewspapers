PASSENGERS ESCAPE ALIVE

Injuries to Passengers Mostly Slight; Fresno Girl Who Brings
First Aid to Injured Heroine of One of the Most Disas
trous Accidents In History of Railroad; Local Hospital Full
of Battered Up Tourists; Dead Engineer Believed to Have
Miscalculated Time.

A. W. Green of Las Vegas, Santa Fe
engineer, is dead; H. C. Flower, fire
man, of Las Vegas is terribly scald
ed and cannot recover; Arthur Hoblin
son of Chicago, dining car waiter will
barely pull through with his life and
a score or more of railroad employes
and passengers, many of whom are in
the Santa Fe hospital here, are more
or less injured as the result of a ter
rific collision near Domingo station
about thirty miles north of here at
10:12 a. m. yesterday.
The California Limited train, No. 3,
the crack transcontinental flyer of
the Santa Fe, while running fifty
miles an hour at mile post 182, two
and a half miles west of Domingo
station, collided with a light engine,
No. 065, going at nearly the same
speed, utterly demolishing the light
engine and scattering it along the
track for twenty-five yards; derailing,
capsizing and badly damaging engine
KM7 of the limited; tearing up 100
feet of track, derailing the mail car
of the flyer and seriously damaging
every car on the limited train. The
wreck occurred just at the west
end of a bridge half a mile beyond
the Santo Domingo Indian village.

FIFTY-ONE PASSENGERS
INJURED AND WON'T KNOW HURT.
Promptly on receipt of the news of
the disaster the local Santa Fe offi
cials made up a relief train of five
cars with record-breaking speed and
made the run to Domingo in quick
time. The train bore in addition to
a large number of officials and work
men, Surgeon Dr. J. H. Wroth of the
Santa Fe, and Dr. Spargo with a full
supply of emergency apparatus. The
relief train arrived on the scene just
two hours after the collision, too late
to do anything for Engineer Green
who had passed away, an hour and forty
minutes after the wreck under a
hastily improvised shelter under the
bridge, made with some sheets. Green
bore no external marks of injury save
a bruise on one arm but was
evidently fearfully hurt internally.
In the meantime a work train had
arrived at the scene of the catastrophe
and was unable to give timely assistance.
The physicians and assistants got
busy and in fifty-five minutes started
the injured to this city, arriving at the local
station about 3:45 to be greeted by
an enormous crowd of people which
thronged the station platform from
one end to the other and which in
spite of the efforts of Chief of Police
McMillin and policemen crowded so
tightly around the train that it was
almost impossible to take off the dead
and injured. It was a tense scene as

the doctors and assistants passed out
the litters bearing the bodies of the
dead and wounded which were hastily
carried to ambulances and rushed to
the St. Joseph's hospital. In the throng
that surged around the arriving train
were numerous Albuquerque people
with friends or relatives on the train,
anxious for their safety. Mrs. Parker,
a niece of Nell U. Field of this city
was on the train, happily unhurt, and
her relatives were rejoiced to find
when she arrived. None of the pas
sengers save those taken to the hos
pital were hurt enough to inconvenience
them with the exception of
Mrs. Middle of Willows, Cal., who had
to be carried into the Alvarado and
carried up stairs to her room. She
was suffering severely from the shock
and internal injuries were feared but
at last accounts she was doing nicely.
C. A. Canfield, the wealthy Los
Angeles man, partner of K. U. Dohony
the Los Angeles oil millionaire, got
off the train and walked to the hotel
leaning heavily on a cane and walking
with a decided limp and nearly
every passenger, by bandage, scratches
or disordered clothing and disheveled
appearance, showed the effect of the
accident. Conductor Charles Clark of
the limited, who had a cut on his
nose was badly dazed by a blow on
the back of the neck and walked
home with difficulty. It is not
believed however that he is seriously
hurt.
DEAD ENGINEER MISTAKEN:
MISCALCULATED THE TIME;
That Engineer Green took or ran
chance too many is believed to have
been the cause of the wreck and of
the loss of the unfortunate man's life.
When the crash came he was thirty
seconds into the limited's limit, hav
ing evidently made the attempt to
run the distance from Eloti to Do
mingo in twelve minutes. The wreck
occurred on a double curve. In re it
was impossible for the crews to see
each other until within a short dis
tance. Engineer Scalover jammed on
the emergency brakes or in railroad
parlance he "plugholed her" and the
heavy and swiftly moving train stiff
ened out like an iron bar but appar
ently did not slacken a particle be
fore the impact came. The crash was
heard for miles. The heavy engine of
the limited with front battered in
hurled herself off the track into the
bank. Scalover, without knowing how
he got there found himself standing
on top of his engine cab as he had time
to jump. His luckless fireman,
Flower essayed to jump but was too
slow and was caught in the scalding
steam. Engineer Green tried to jump
but jumped on the wrong side and
was pinned under his engine when
he was extricated with difficulty, it
being evident at once that he was
mortally injured. His fireman, Bren
nan, jumped safely and escaped prac
tically unhurt.
The light engine, one of the small, u
class, was completely stripped, its
trucks being shot for over 200 feet
down the track. The mail car on the
flyer was canted up in the air, half
on and half off the bridge, and the
tender was a twisted and broken mass
of iron.
The remainder of the limited train
was badly damaged all the way
through; the terrific shock, withstood
splendidly by the heavy steel con
struction, shot the glass of the win
dows out in fragments like projectiles;
the tables in the dining car were piled
up like kindling wood, and practical
ly every piece of glass of any kind in
the train was broken, the vestibules
draw heads and equipment between
the cars were torn and crushed, steps
torn off, and the buffet car was a
scene of disaster, all its supplies bein
ruined.
The dead engineer's watch was
stopped on the half minute showing
plainly the second of the accident. The
body of the light engine remained on
the track about 100 feet distant from
the place where it was struck.
It was reported by some of the pas
sengers that the Santo Domingo Indian
village was deserted when the wreck
occurred. (Continued on 1B, column 3.)

ALBUQUERQUE,

NOTED SALOON SMASHER
SUCCUMBS TO PARESIS
Death Attributed to Nervous
Breakdown Result of Failure
of Lecture Bureau to Pay Her
For Platform Work,
By Morning Journal Special Leased Wire
Leavenworth, Kan., June 9. Carrie
Nation, the Kansas saloon smasher
died here tonight at 7:05 p. m.
Paresis was the cause of death. Mrs.
Nation had been in poor health for
months and on January 11 she entered
the local sanitarium in which she died,
hoping to recover from a nervous
breakdown.
It became evident several days ago
that Mrs. Nation could not recover
and Dr. Al Sumal.sky, her physician at
the sanitarium, informed her that the
end was near. She said nothing but
smiled. She became unconscious at
noon today and did not revive. Rel
atives had been telegraphed for, but
only Dr. Sumal.sky and a nurse were
at the bedside when she died.
Worry over lawsuits, which she had
filed against a lecture bureau, for al
leged failure to pay for services on
the platform is said to have caused
her to breakdown.
A recent attempt to serve her with
summons in a suit was balked by the
owner of the sanitarium.
The last five months of Mrs. Na
tion's life in the sanitarium was in
marked contrast to her former activ
ity. Once she saw a physician at the
sanitarium smoking a cigarette. She
made no remonstrance, merely saying
she had done all she could to "eradicate
the evil."
The body will be sent to Kansas
City, Kan., tomorrow morning.
Funeral services will be held there
probably Sunday.
Mrs. Carrie Nation was born in
Kentucky in 1846. Her maiden name
was Carrie Moore and as a girl, it is
said, she was absolutely fearless. In
her early life she married a man ad
dicted to the use of intoxicants which
created in her an intense aversion to
the saloon. When he died, she de
termined to devote her life to the sup
pression of the liquor traffic.
Later she moved to Kansas and
married David Nation, who sympathized
with her temperance principles.
He divorced her ten years ago.
Mrs. Nation's first saloon smashing
was done in the barroom of the Carrl
hotel at Wichita, December 17, 1900.
She was arrested and remained in
jail several days before she was re
leased on bond.
On January 21, 1901 armed with
her favorite weapon, a hatchet, Mrs.
Nation made another raid in Wichita.
This time she smashed two saloons.
During the next three months, Mrs.
Nation surprised the jointists in vari
ous Kansas towns, appearing unher
alded and leaving a trail of ruined
barroom fixtures wherever she went.
Many jointists became terror-stricken
when the militant temperance advo
cate appeared in their neighborhoods
and locked their places and fled be
fore the faithful hatchet could get
into action.
Remarkably few of the saloonmen
used violence in resisting Mrs. Na
tion although she was assaulted and
badly hurt while wrecking a barroom
at Enterprise, Kan.
By this time the state of Kansas
was in a ferment. Aroused by the
spirit of the dauntless woman from
Kentucky, the people began to demand
that all the saloons and joints be
closed at once. Smashing parties were
organized all over the state. The
saloon power was being wrecked. As
a result of the agitation bills were
passed by the legislature which
strengthened the state prohibitory
laws.
Thus erratic as her life has been,
Mrs. Nation was responsible for the
greatest temperance awakening in
Kansas.
Mrs. Nation after her activities in
Kansas, became a lecturer and the
editor of a paper called the Smasher's
Mail.
She did little smashing outside of
Kansas. While lecturing in New York
she created a sensation by appearing
at the Horse Show in Madison Square
Garden and demanding that the occu
pants of the Vanderbilt box con
tribute money for a home for drunk
ards' wives which she founded in Kan
sas City, Kan.
The home recently was taken over
by the Associated Charities of Kan
sas City.

NEW MEXICO, SATURDAY, JUNE 10, 1911.

Commercial Club Directors
Choose Strong List of Offi
cers; Mr. Brooks Insists Up
on Resignation,
CAPABLE BUSINESS MEN
TO HEAD ORGANIZATION
With Assistant to Care for De
tails Secretary Will Devote
Entire Time to Work for
Greater Albuquerque.
Simon Stern, president.
John Lee Clarke, first vice presi
dent.
George A. Kaseman, second vice
president.
Thomas J. Naylon, secretary,
F. H. Schwentker, treasurer.
Those officers were elected for the
ensuing year at a meeting of the
Commercial club directors yesterday.
The directors also decided to employ
an assistant to the secretary. This of
ficial will take care of the detail work
of the secretary's office, which will
leave the secretary free to devote all
of his time to furthering the important
projects of the club, to the end
that next year's work may be even
more successful than that of the one
just closed, which marked a new era
in the life of the club.
A letter was received from Mr.
George L. Brooks in which that gen
tleman heartily thanked the club for
its expression of confidence as shown
by its refusal at Thursday night's
meeting to accept Mr. Brooks' resig
nation. Mr. Brooks pointed out, how
ever, that he will be obliged to be
away from Albuquerque the greater
portion of the time during the next
year, and for this reason he felt that
he could not do justice to the position
of director and must insist that his
resignation be accepted. This matter
will be taken up at the next meeting
of the club when, it is probable, Mr.
Brooks' successor will be named.
The club is preparing five thousand
postcards for distribution on postcard
day. The cards are now in the handb
of the printer and the public can se
cure them on application to the sec
retary on and after Monday morning.
Those present at the directors
meeting yesterday were George Ar
not, John Lee Clarke, F. B. Schwent
ker, Simon Stern, George A. Kaseman
and D. A. Macpherson.
The news of the election of Mr.
Stern as president will be received
with intense satisfaction by the people
of Albuquerque. Mr. Stern is one
of the pioneer business men of the
city and has always taken a prominent
part in every movement for its
betterment. That the club will con
tinue its career of prosperity and
usefulness under his leadership is as
sured. The retention of Thomas J. Naylon
as secretary will also be hailed by the
club members and the public general
ly as a wise move. During his con
nection with the club Mr. Naylon has
proven himself a most capable and
energetic official and, with an assist
ant to take care of the detail work of
his office, it is predicted that this
year's work will be remembered only
as a feeble sample of the accomplishments
which will earn him the grati
tude of the people of Albuquerque
ere his present term expires.
The other officials are all strong
men, tried and true in the club work,
and may be depended upon to
strengthen the hands of their capable
leader in keeping the institution
what it has been almost since the
foundation of Albuquerque, the leading
boosting organization of New
Mexico.
Congressional Committee Anx
ious to Question Prophet
Smith Concerning Knowledge
of Sugar Trust,
By Morning Journal Special Leased Wire
Washington, June 9. The house
committee to investigate the American
Sugar Refining company has di
rected to summon Joseph Smith, pres
ident of the Mormon church to tell
what he knows of the dealings of the
so-called sugar trust with the beet
sugar interests controlled by the
church.
Subpoenas will be issued for leading
beet sugar men in the west. Chairman
Hardwick of the committee said the
committee will begin public hearings
Monday with the testimony of the
eastern sugar men; and that President
Smith and other western men
will not be heard until the eastern
witnesses have finished.

SUMMONED

REPUBLICAN INSURGENT
FINDS FLAWS IN TARIFF
Gentleman From Washington
Declares Millions More Might
Be Collected If Internal Rev
enues Were Properly Fixed,
By Morning Journal Special Leased Wire

Washington, June 9. Representative
Warren of Washington, a
newly elected Republican insurgent,
charged Congress today with letting
millions of dollars go to waste that it
might collect in internal revenue taxes
on tobacco. He attacked the pending
wool tariff revision offered by
the Democrats, saying their plea of
needing revenue was not a serious
argument for keeping high duties on
woolen goods.
Mr. Warren said the Democrats
had been afraid to reduce the duties
on wool any further for fear of the
consequences at the next election if
the wool industry was prostrated by
the removal of protection, tie said
the Democrats had been compelled to
adopt the Republican doctrine of pro
tection, and excused themselves on
the ground of needing revenue.
"And in the meantime," said Mr.
Warren, "American people are
paying six times as much tax to the
government on sugar as they are on
five cent cigars; twelve times as much
on sugar as on ten cent cigars; thirty
times as much on sugar as on twenty
five cent cigars; and sixty times as
much on sugar as on fifty cent
cigars."
Representative Peters of Massa
chusetts, a Democratic member of the
ways and means committee, said wool
and woolen goods would have been
made free but for the necessity of
revenue. He said the duties had
been placed as low as consistent with
securing enough revenue to run the
government.
EARTHQUAKE DEATHS
ESTIMATED AT 350
News of Devastation In Re
mote Sections of Mexico
Seeps Slowly Into Capital;
Small Towns Worst Sufferers
By Morning Journal Special Leased Wire
Mexico City, June 9. Because of
the lack of telegraphic facilities and
the slowness with which the officials
of the villages in outlying districts
make reports to the government, it is
not improbable months may pass be
fore an absolutely accurate statement
of the number of earthquake
victims is obtainable.
The list of known dead totals a few
more than 150 and it is quite possible
this number may be augmented, but
neither government officials nor lo
cal newspapers believe it will pass the
350 mark, notwithstanding early ru
mors placed the number at more than
1,000.
Special dispatches indicate the
greatest toll was near the west coast
in the states of Colima and Jalisco,
although no deaths are reported
from Guadalajara, the capital of the
latter.
According to the latest reports not
more than five or six were killed in
the capital of Colima.
A special dispatch from Tuxpan,
reports Sayula as having suffered
greatly and the number of dead would
reach probably forty, about the same
number reported from Zapotlan, er
roneously given here first as Ocotlan.
The first accurate news of the
earthquake's effects in Colima was
brought to Tuxpan by a merchant who
made the latter half of his journey on
foot because of an interruption of the
railroad traffic due to the track being
damaged by the quake.
According to him only five are dead.
The churches, he says, suffered most,
Moyer church and the cathedral be
ing badly damaged. According
to his story most of the buildings dam
aged were small and poorly built.
The volcano of Colima continues in
eruption and burning trees on its sides
add to its spectacular appearance.
The engineer in charge of the
capital's waterworks system today re
ports seventeen cracks had been made
in the main, but the damage had not
been sufficient to interfere seriously
with the water supply.
From here two detachments were
sent out into the west to care for the
wounded and another detachment has
gone from Guadalajara. Most of the
Red Cross doctors and nurses will go
to Zapotlan and Colima. This organiza-
tion also has cared for wounded here.
In the capital the greatest property
loss was incurred by the government
in the loss of the artillery barracks
by schools and by corporations.
Residents of the capital are begin
ning to regard the affair as hyper-
bolic and some of the afternoon papers
"killed" the earthquake stories in
their last editions to make room for
later news.

WARSHIP TO
MEXICAN
COAST

Cruiser to Back Demand For
Million Pesos Indemnity for
Savage Slaughter of Helpless
Orientals at Torreon.
INCREDIBLE BRUTALITY
OF RUFFIANLY MURDERERS
Bodies Torn Asunder By Wild
Horses and Chopped to
Pieces While Mexican Spec
tators Grin With Glee.
By Morning Journal Special Leased Wire
Mexico City, June 9. An indemnity
of twelve million pesos will be de
manded of Mexico by the Chinese gov
ernment for the slaughter of Chinese
subjects in Torreon. The demand will
be backed up by a cruiser which is
on the way to Mexican west coast
ports.
Three investigators returned today
from Torreon and placed in the hands
of Shung Hal Sun, charge d'affaires
of the Chinese legation, a detailed re
port of the carnage. This shows 305
Chinese were killed, many of them in
a most inhuman manner and that bo
sides a bank and club house, eighty
nine places of business were sacked.
In addition to the indemnity an
apology for insult to the Chinese flag
will be demanded; also that aid be ex
tended to destitute families of the
victims, that the guilty be punished
and the constitution guarantees of
protection to Chinese lives and prop
erty be made effective.
Of the twelve million pesos in
indemnity, two million is for property
damage and the remainder for the
loss of lives.
Commenting upon the matter Mr.
Shung said that owing to the savage
manner in which the Chinese were
killed, there has been no attempt by
his nation to fix the amount of the
indemnity by prescribed methods.
The report made by the investigators
goes back to the anti-foreign ex
citement starting on September 10,
Mexico's centennial anniversary when
at a public meeting in Torreon, the
"killing of the Spaniards first and
then the Chinese" was advocated by
a speaker.
In the detailed report, the Torreon
massacre is laid at the door of both
sides in the revolution. It says the
federals gave no notice they were go
ing to evacuate the city after being
helplessly beaten and when ruffians
knew the soldiers had gone they be
gan an anti-Chinese demonstration,
killing many.
Then the rebels entered the city
and the carnage was given impetus.
The federals are blamed for not giv
ing notice that they intended evacu
ating and the rebels for joining the
massacre.
The report recites tale after tale of
barbarous slaughter, stories of how
victims' arms and legs were tied to
horses and their bodies torn asunder;
heads cut off and savagely rolled
about the streets as the Mexicans
grinned in glee; bodies cut into small
bits and battered about the streets
and of dead and half dead Chinese
dragged about the town at ends of
ropes attached to horses. Blood drip
ping through the floor in the Chinese
bank was terrible evidence of the
murder of twenty-five men in the sec
ond story.
An American woman saved the life
of one Chinese boy by throwing her
arms about his neck as the Mexicans
were about to stab him and a Mexican
girl protected nine Chinese in her
home after her father had been shot
dead before her eyes when he pro
tested he was not harboring any
Orientals.
Reports say this slaughter kept up
until a party of business men headed
by the American consul, demanded of
the rebel leader to stop the massacre.
It was stopped and the two hundred
orientals left were put in jail for
safety.
All Chinese not killed the report
says, were saved from starvation only
by the Red Cross, the American con
sul and foreign banks.
REBELS KILL REYES
WITH HIS OWN GUNS.
Mexico City, June 9. "Down with
Reyes, viva Madero." Such was the
first greeting extended to General
Bernardo Reyes when he arrived this.
afternoon. A few thousand residents
were at the station, but the Mader
istas were the first to acknowledge
their presence.
General Reyes was not formally re
ceived with the honors to which an
officer of his rank is entitled. His
reception was such as any civilian
might have received.
The reception committee was far up
the station toward the gate when the
general's special train arrived. Ac
companied by the small group of of
ficers and rebel escort, which came
with him from Orizaba, he made his
way to the committee which was
struggling through the curious, rather
than enthusiastic crowd, to welcome
him.
In the meantime the Maderistas who
had yelled "Down with Reyes,"
had hustled themselves with, snatching
