A DOT AND A DASH IN LIFE.
Night Manager Frank Morris of the
Western Union Telegraph company,
celebrated his twentieth birthday
yesterday. A most incomprehensible
thing to him is the circumstance
that though he had been in town hardly
a week everybody seems to know how
old he is, because he was over
whelmed with cards anonymously sent,
congratulating him upon his birthday.
TIFFANY-BERG. Cards were received
in this city yesterday announcing
the marriage at Chicago on July 15
of Mr. Willis N. Tiffany and Mrs. Marie
H. Berg. They will be at home in Phoe
nix after October 15. The bride, then
Mrs. Marie Kloeckner, resided in Phoe
nix last winter and while here obtained
a divorce from her husband. She re
turned to her home in Chicago early in
the present year.
AN UNDEFINED CRIME. Thomas
Roberts, a young man, was in police
court yesterday afternoon on a criminal
charge, that of taking a young girl
of 11 into a saloon. That is a crime
not very well defined, though a complaint
might be lodged against the girl
herself or against the proprietor into
whose house she was permitted to
come. Fortunately a charge of drunk
enness could be lodged against Roberts
and the punishment was made broad
enough to cover his undefined offense
ten days.

JOURNAL-MINER'S NEW HOME.
The Journal-Miner of Prescott will
soon have a permanent abiding place
again. On Wednesday Editor J. C.
Martin bought a lot and the next day
he began the construction of a new
building, which he hopes will endure
as long as he wants to remain in jour
nalism, and for many years thereafter
for the Journal-Miner will endure long
after Editor Martin has been gathered
to his fathers.
A MISSING HUSBAND. Marshal
Hooker yesterday received a letter of
inquiry regarding the whereabouts of
George Regie. The writer is Mrs. Lou
isa Metzger of Silver City, N. M. She
says she writes at the request of friends
of Mrs. Regie, who has gone insane
about her husband. He left Silver City
about eight months ago and has not
been heard from since. Several persons
here thought, but were not quite sure,
that a man of that name had been here
within the last few weeks.
ANOTHER PHOENIX MERCHANT.
A. Blumberg, a well known Prescott
merchant, yesterday leased a
store room from Harry J. Jones,
the new owner of the build
ing at the corner of Center and Wash
ington streets, known as the Goldman
corner. The lease covers the eastern
side of the Washington street front and
runs for five years. Mr. Blumberg will
put in a large stock of dry goods and
millinery, and will at the same time
keep up his Prescott business. Mr.
Jones will shortly begin the remodeling
of his building.
MAX SOHR'S WEALTH. An in
quiry was received at the probate court
yesterday from the Austro-Hungarian
consulate at San Francisco concerning
the property in this county of the late
Max Sohr, who died here on December
31. The inquiry is probably made on
behalf of relatives of Sohr in Austro-
Hungary. Sohr left no estate in this
county, though he was very wealthy.
A few days before his death he trans
ferred his belongings here, consisting
of valuable horses and other personal
property, to his brother-in-law, George
Weber of Chicago. A considerable part
of Sohr's wealth, consisting of mining
property, lies in Utah.
BEGINNING AT THE BOTTOM. A
gentleman who arrived in the city
from Solomonville yesterday, said that
the sheriff of Graham county had de
cided to take stringent measures to
break up the outlawry which has pre
vailed in the eastern part of Graham
and Gila counties for several years. It
is known that a band of murderous
Mexicans have been having a rendez
vous in an almost inaccessible section
of the Eagle creek country and that a
band of equally desperate American
outlaws have been making their head
quarters on Black river. Until those
nests of crime are broken up there can
be no hope of steady good order. Sher
iff Clark had accordingly started for
Globe to enlist the assistance of a
posse from Gila county in the exter
mination of these bands or their expul
sion from the country.

ARIZONA GENIUS
Most Perfect Scale Yet Invented, the
Work of Phoenicians.
Ever since "Fairbanks" became a
household word and "Jones of Binghamton"
announced that "he would
pay the freight" the inventive genius
of America has turned itself loose on
the subject of scales. Remarkable progress
has been made over the crude old
traps first employed to determine
weights and measures and not only
every store and business house but al
most every family has a convenient and
fairly accurate scale. But there is al
ways room for improvement in one way
or another, if it is only in beauty, in
ornamentation and of late years the
idea of computation has been added to
that of weight, so that scales will not
only automatically register the amount
of avoirdupois but give the total value
at any desired rate per pound. The
first efforts in this line, like the auto
matic cash register, were novel and
unique, and while they did what was
claimed for them, they were compli
cated and easily disordered. Improve
ments followed until fairly practical
results were obtained, but the expense
of the best scales now manufactured
is considerable.
The latest, however, is a scale re
cently perfected and patented by F. B.
Moss and J. A. Menard of this city.
It is remarkably simple in construc
tion, can be cheaply manufactured and
in the matter of computation results
are shown at a glance. The model run
by a Republican reporter is a trans
formation of an old Fairbanks scale, but
the mechanism can be applied to any
scale, upright or balance. The plat
form holding the goods to be weighed
is the same as any scale. In place of
a rod running up the standard is a
steel band like an uncoiled heavy
watch spring. This is buttoned at the
top on to a metal piece, which, for want
of a better name, will be called a spool.
The spool rests on a balance made from
an inverted knife-blade. Friction is
impossible in either of these bearing
and that is all there is to it. As re
gistering the result it is equally as
simple. From the opposite side of the
spool to which the steel line is attached
an arm extends out two or three inches
then curves downward to the comput
ing sheet or board which is attached to
the upright, midway between the plat
form and top of the scale.
To the end of this arm is attached
something very like the hand of a
clock, on which are the figures from one
up as far as desired, and including the
fractions. The hand slides along over
the computation board and wherever it
stops will be found the price accurately
figured out for the number of pounds
on the scale.
Another important feature of the
scale is a quicksilver regulator attached
to the upright, which reduces the quiv
ering of the hand on the dial to a mini
mum, so the result is shown almost in
stantly. The scale can be made to weigh anything from a grain of wheat to the
cars of a train in motion, providing
they do not go too fast. Mr. Moss says
he can weigh a whole train in ten min
utes with a scale made for the purpose.
There are no springs, T's, or weights
to bother with.
Mr. Menard is now in Chicago build
ing three models for the patent office
and the manufacturers.

Low or medium degrees of myopia or
short sight generally known as near
sight, are seldom dangerous when the
eyes are properly fitted with glasses.
High degrees are both dangerous and
progressive; cannot be wholly checked
by the use of glasses and when compli
cated with disease, weakened constitu
tion or neglect, usually lead to
partial or total blindness. I exercise
great care in the fitting of myopes.
Advise how to lessen danger. Will be
