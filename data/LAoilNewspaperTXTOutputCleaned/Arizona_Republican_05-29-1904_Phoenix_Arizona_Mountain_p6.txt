"None So Blind as Those Who
Won't See."
There's no truer saying. There are
those who won't see simply because
they won't wear glasses. They see but
half what others see, and but little of
what they might see.
Neither do they see the danger of
letting defective eyes go uncorrected.
They see well, but do so by an
effort on nerve and muscle force.
Usually is this so in the case of
women and young people. The re
sult is head ache and many other
aches, all of which, when caused by
eyes, are instantly removed by proper
lenses. I offer you honest, competent,
conscientious optical service. Examina
tions free.

You Must Try
Our Soda
We can't tell you how delicious
our soda water is; you must try
it for yourself. But it is just as
good as we know how to make it
or as anybody else knows how
to make it. We have studied the
question thoroughly and
put into practice all that
we have learned. One of the
most important soda truths that
we thus appreciate is that the
making of perfect soda requires
choicest materials—nothing less
than the very best. This reduces
profit, of course, but profit is not
everything.

AFTER BAD MAN. Deputy Sheriff
Gonzales has gone to Minas Prietas,
Mexico, after a Mexican believed to be
wanted in this county for murder.
MANAGEMENT CHANGED. Mrs.
Turner, formerly of the Sixth Avenue
Hotel, has leased the Gilbert
House,
which will hereafter be conducted un-
der its former name, The Gilbert. It
has been thoroughly renovated, fumi-
gated and repapered.
LIVE STOCK MATTERS. Dr. J. C.
Norton has received a printed copy,
just issued, of the proceedings of the
seventh annual meeting of the Inter-
state Association of the Live Stock San-
itary Boards, which was held last De-
cember in Denver. At that session Dr.
Norton was honored with election to
the position of president of the associa-
tion, and he announces that the next
meeting of the association will be held
in St. Louis, August 23-26, inclusive.
These dates were secured after much
effort and for the reason that the
American Veterinary Medical Associa-
tion will hold its meeting there the
week before, and it is hoped through
this fact to secure a larger attendance
of veterinarians.
CHOO CHOO WAGONS. Mr. and
Mrs. Cecil S. Fennell and F. W. Foster
of Prescott, arrived here late Friday
night from Tucson, having made
the journey overland in a new Cham-
bers touring car which Mr. Foster sold
to Mr. Fennell in Tucson. They will
leave for Prescott, probably today, and
expect to make the northern journey
the same way. They will travel via
Wickenburg, going up the bed of the
Hassayampa through the box canyon.
J. A. Aitkin of this city has also
bought him a horseless carriage of the
Oldsmobile sort, through the agency of
W. K. Rhodes, and has taken his first
lessons in the art of "chauffeuring."
This makes sixteen automobiles now
owned in this city and it will not be
long till one must have a machine in
order to break into society.
THE ARMSTRONG CASE. Attor-
ney Thomas Flannigan arrived here
defending W. T. Armstrong in the
cases brought against him by the live
stock sanitary board for violations of
the law under which that department
of the territorial government operates.
Mr. Armstrong was indicted on three
charges and has been tried on two of
them. In the first case he was found
not guilty but was convicted on the
second when his counsel moved for a
new trial. Hearing on the motion will
come up in the district court in Flor-
ence next Tuesday. Mr. Flannigan
came to Phoenix after legal
law books. He couldn’t find enough in
Pinal County to cover the points he is
after. The third case has not yet been
filed. Mr. Flannigan, who was for-
merly district attorney of this county,
now resides in Tombstone, which is
anything but a graveyard for him as
he is looking well and feeling
better
than he ever did before.
NEW CORPORATIONS. The terri-
tory of Arizona goes merrily ahead in
the creation of new corporations, re-
gardless of the keen competition from
New Jersey, West Virginia, South Da-
kota, and other backwoods districts.
The companies born yesterday under
and by virtue of the laws of Arizona
comprise the Cedar Basin Oil and
Gas Company, with an authorized capi-
tal of $500,000, the incorporators being
H. H. Brooks, G. Brooks and J. F.
Russell, of Kansas; the Wasatch Fi-
nance Company, $1,000,000 capital, with
F. M. Spaulding, C. K. Potter and F.
S. Williams of Los Angeles as the in-
corporators; the Big Hill Oil and Gas
Company, with $1,000,000 capital and I.
M. Earnest and C. S. Coleman of Kan-
sas, as the incorporators; the Susque-
hanna Oil and Gas Company, $1,000,000
capital, with A. N. Yost, J. H. Cole-
man and W. R. Holmes of Pennsyl-
vania, as the incorporators; and the
Black Butte Mining and Reduction
Company, $750,000 capital, with T. Cou-
nel, V. Cox, M. Thompson and J. C.
Robbins of Phoenix as the incorpora-
tors.

LEGAL VIEW OF POUTING MAN.
Missouri Judge Holds That a Husband
Who Sulks Gives Ground for Divorce.
In deciding for the woman plaintiff
in a divorce case this week Judge
Shelton held that pouting on the part
of a husband was ground for separa-
tion, says a Lancaster, Missouri, dis-
patch.
Mrs. Mary M. Smith, aged thirty,
testified that she was married to Evan
A. Smith in Scotland County, June
29, 1900, and that after her husband
had established a law practice
at St. Louis she returned to Scotland
County where she lived with her par-
ents.
"During the past eighteen months,"
said the plaintiff, "Mr. Smith spent
nearly all his time pouting. He would
get in a corner and sulk and speak to
nobody.
"It became unendurable. I tried to
be kind to him, but received no en-
couragement. Once he brightened up 
enough to tell me I had no sense. I
couldn’t love an iceberg, judge, and
just had to leave him."
Smith said he was quiet by nature,
and not given to much talk. He added
that he loved his wife and never
abused her.
The judge said a wife had a right to
expect love making and caresses from
her husband, and if she didn't receive
them she was justified in seeking a sep-
aration.
"A pouting woman is bad enough,"
the court said aside, after leaving the
bench, "but a pouting man is the limit
of intolerableness, and I don’t believe
the good Lord ever expected any wo-
man to put up with such a creature.
If she can, her wings are due."
