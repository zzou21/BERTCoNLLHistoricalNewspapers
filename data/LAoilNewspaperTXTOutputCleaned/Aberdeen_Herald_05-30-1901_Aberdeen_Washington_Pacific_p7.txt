ABERDEEN HERALD

For more than ten years the matter of
a road to the water works has been a
mooted one between the city, on one
hand, and James Stewart on the other.
By a piece of stupid mismanagement, it
appears that the city built a water sys
tem, at a cost of many thousands of dol
lars, a part of which is the costly pump
ing station two miles up the Wishkah
river, and failed to provide a road to this
station.

The propositions and counter proposi
tions that have been made by the city
council on one side and Mr. Stewart on
the other for the right of way across the
latter's land, to connect B street with
the county road, would fill a page of the
paper. A short time ago it looked as
though an agreement was reached, but,
for some reason or other, it, like its pre
decessors, fell through, and Mr. Stewart
decided to fence in a piece of land that
had been crossed by teams in going to
the water works, and instructed one of
his employees to build the fence.

This fence was built in such a manner
as to close a dedicated street, and block
ed the teams now engaged in hauling
wood to the pumping station, and a com
plaint was made before Judge Pearson
charging Mr. Stewart, his 13-year-old
son and the employee, J. E. Roberts, with
obstructing a highway. The matter was
heard in Judge Pearson's court yester
day, and the entire day was occupied in
hearing the evidence, and the arguments
of Attorneys Shields, for the prosecution,
and Cross for the defense.
The testimony revealed the fact that
the obstruction of the street was done
through a misunderstanding of Mr.
Stewart's orders by Employee Roberts,
and the action was dismissed. In the
present litigious temper of the city
council and Mr. Stewart, it will not be
surprising if a series of lawsuits follow,
such as will make the famous cow case
of Lowry vs. Haynes resemble wisdom
in comparison.

The Smits Drug Company will open
for business Saturday morning in the
building vacated by I. Harris & Sons,
Heron and G streets, with one of the
most handsomely appointed drug stores
to be found outside of the largest cities.
The fittings are the best that could be
procured, and the decorations evince the
good taste of the originator of the plan.
The shelving and woodwork are the
product of the Aberdeen Manufacturing
Co., and reflect credit upon that estab
lishment. These are finished in white
enamel, while the counters are oak, of
the show case variety. To the right of
the entrance is a large John Matthews
soda fountain of Namur marble, and
cushioned settees are provided for the
use of waiting customers, or anyone
wishing to rest a while.

The prescription department occupies
the rear end of the store, and is com
plete in every detail, and is furnished
with settees for those waiting on pre
scriptions. It is the intention of the
company to give special attention to the
filling of prescriptions with the purest
drugs at reasonable prices. Taken as a
whole, the new drug store promises to
be a credit to Aberdeen.

spoons and patter separated about $100

street, last Thursday evening.

The Hoquiam Chamber of Commerce
has appointed the following committee
on arrangements for the reception of
the river and harbor committee of con
gress: Geo. H. Emerson, O. M. Kel
logg, Geo. L. Davis, B. F. Lytle and
Alex. Poison.

An exchange asks: "Why is a news
paper like a wife?" These various ans
wers have been given: "Because both
have to be appreciated." "Because it
has to have something to run it." "Be
cause it changes its dress." The cor
rect answer is: "Because every man
should have one of his own and not run
after his neighbors'."

M. M. Austin, a civil war veteran, of
Winchester, Ind., writes: "My wife was
sick a long time in spite of good doctor's
treatment, but was wholly cured by
Dr. King's New Life Pills, which worked
wonders for her health." They always
do. Try them. Only 25c at Todd's
Pharmacy.

This will be my last week to examine
and treat eyes free for glasses. After
Monday, June 2, I will charge for all ex
aminations. Office at Todd's pharmacy.
