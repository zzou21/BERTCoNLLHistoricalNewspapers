THE AMERICUS TIMES-RECORDER

HOLBROOK TELLS
OF FILMS PLOT
(Continued From Page 1)
the story as he said it had been
related to him by Muma, New York
correspondent of the Cincinnati
Enquirer, and one of those named as
a backer of the distribution plan.
After he had heard Muma’s story
Holdridge went on, he came to Washington
and related it to William J.
Burns, head of the justice department’s
bureau of investigation. Instead of
ordering any prosecutions,
however, he said, Burns transferred
him to a long-pending bank case.
According to Muma, as quoted by
Holdridge, the plan to show the pictures
over the country, despite the
federal law against transportation
across state lines, followed a private
exhibition here at the home of
Edward B. McLean, attended by
President Harding and members of the
cabinet.
At the conclusion of the showing
at the McLean house, Holdridge
said, “Muma had a talk with Attorney
General Daugherty and the
president,” and later Secretary
Hughes, Secretary Christian and
Harry S. New, then a senator and
now postmaster general, joined in
the discussion.
“It seemed to be the general opinion,”
said the
witness, “that it was a shame people
could not see them. Later,
Muma, talking with the attorney
general, he told me, was told that
the law against the pictures was
solely directed to their transportation.
“Muma went on to say Attorney
General Daugherty directed him to
see Alfred R. Urion, an attorney in
Washington. He said he saw
Urion and that he told him what to
do.”
Muma, then was quoted as saying
that he reached an understanding
with Urion, who was supposed to be
a friend of the attorney general,
with the result that “we went to it,”
exhibiting the pictures in more than
20 states with large profits.
The witness also declared that
Muma had shown him a copy of the
contract under which the deal was
consummated and under which
Muma, under a dummy name, was
to receive 50 per cent of the profits.
The contract, he said, bore the
names of Tex Rickard, the fight
promoter, and F. C. Quimby, producer
of the picture.
RECEIVERS NAMED FOR
OIL RESERVE HOLDINGS
LOS ANGELES, March 18.
Judge Paul J. McCormick Monday
named Rear Admiral Harry H.
Rousseau and J. B. Anderson, president
of the Pan-American Petroleum
company, as joint receivers for
the Doheny naval oil reserve lands
in District No. 1.
The receivers will each put up a
bond of $10,000 to insure the carrying
out of the provisions of the trust.
The Pan-American company, of
which Anderson is president is controlled
by Doheny.

If You Need a
Medicine You Should
Have the Best
Have you ever stopped to reason
why it is that so many products
that are extensively advertised, all
at once drop out of sight and
are soon forgotten? The reason is
plain—the article did not fulfill
the promises of the manufacturer.
This applies more particularly to a
medicine. A medicinal preparation
that has real curative value almost
sells itself, as like an endless chain
system the remedy is recommended
by those who have been benefited,
to those who are in need of it.
A prominent druggist says “Take
for example Dr. Kilmer’s Swamp-
Root, a preparation I have sold for
many years and never hesitate to
recommend, for in almost every
case it shows excellent results, as
many of my customers testify. No
other kidney remedy has so large a
sale.”
According to sworn statements
verified testimony of thousands
who have used the preparation, the
success of Dr. Kilmer’s Swamp-
Root is due to the fact, so many
people claim, that it fulfills almost
every wish in overcoming kidney,
liver and bladder ailments, corrects
urinary troubles and neutralizes
the uric acid which causes rheumatism.
You may receive a sample bottle
of Swamp-Root by Parcel Post. Address
Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton,
N. Y., and enclose ten cents;
also mention this paper. Large and
medium size bottles for sale at all
drug stores. (adv.)

STOP CATARRH! OPEN
NOSTRILS AND HEAD
Says Cream Applied in Nostrils
Relieves Head-Colds at Once.
If your nostrils are clogged and your
head is stuffed and you can’t breathe
freely because of a cold or catarrh, just
get a small bottle of Ely’s Cream Balm

this fragrant, antiseptic cream into
your nostrils and let it penetrate
through every air passage of your
head, soothing and healing the inflamed,
swollen mucous membrane and
you get instant relief.
Ah! How good it feels. Your nostrils
are open, your head is clear, no
more hawking, snuffling, blowing; no
