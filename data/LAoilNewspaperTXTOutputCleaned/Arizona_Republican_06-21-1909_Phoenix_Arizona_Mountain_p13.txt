ELECTRIC RUNABOUT
MODEL TOWN AUTO
Central Garage Has a New Machine
With Ideal Characteristics.

The smoothest article in the way of
a runabout automobile, that has ever
been seen on the Phoenix streets, made
its maiden trip around town Saturday,
from the Central garage.

In fact it
made several of them for the proprietors who felt just a wee bit chesty over
the machine and couldn't help letting
their friends know about it and try it
out. Their pride is not the pride of
vanity that goeth before a fall, but the
pride of having a new thing of which
they hope to sell a dozen or two in the

fall.
This machine is a Columbus run
about and in its class is certainly an
aristocrat. It is not a touring car or
a mountain climber for it has neither
the weight nor the lungs, but for use
about the city streets or for any sort
of a run under eighty miles on decent
roads it is a gem. The car is light,
has large tires, and being electric it
of course has no big engine pumping
on its insides or throbbing and jerking.
It is almost noiseless and unlike the
big cars it can go by a cemetery without
disturbing the dead. There is no
cranking to do that often delays the
game, to say nothing about the work,
nor yet does it perambulate in an atmosphere of gasoline or burning
grease.
Another fine feature of the machine
is that its operation is by a lever in
front of the driver instead of a big
wheel that takes up all the room. The
speed is regulated by a single lever at
the left side of the driver, which when
pushed clear back serves as a brake,
while to reverse, one merely lifts another lever and operates as in going
straight ahead. A very desirable feature of the car is that unlike most
machines it is consistent with the rule
of the road. The operating machinery
is at the left end of the seat and the
driver sits on the left side of the ve
hicle. The rule of the road is to keep
to the right, yet on most cars the
driver has to sit on the right side so
he cannot see when he is safely dis
tant from the vehicle he is passing un
less he leaves the breach between them
so wide he needs a telephone to pass
the time of day. With this machine one
could clip the hair off a dog without
touching him.
It is not intended for a racing car or
to satisfy the whims of a speed man
iac, though if necessary it can run
faster than the law allows and that
ought to be a fact for law abiding peo
ple, while on the contrary it can slow
down to the gait of the fattest old lady

who happens to be crossing the street

or slip along the street like a rubber

heeled cop on the trail of a pickpocket.

One can go just as slowly and safely

as he wants to and control the ap
paratus as easily as he could a hobby

horse, though if he is really murder
ously inclined he can get up a death
dealing movement and slip upon his

victim unawares and run over him and

kill him before he knows it. For that

reason only people of respectability

and character should be allowed to
buy them, though at the worst the
Columbus is the least murderous of

any of them.
The batteries are located in the cow
catcher, or that front end construction
where the carburetter of the ordinary
stink wagon usually lurks. The Co
lumbus is said to assimilate about six
cents' worth of current a month including the electric power. This, though, will require an initial plant in the owner's private gar
age at a cost of $250 or $350 for charg
ing the batteries by attaching an ord
inary electric light wire, the runabout
itself costing about $1800. But if one

prefers to keep the machine in a gar
age as he would his horse in a livery
barn the charge for the machine will
about equal the livery bill. That in
cludes grooming and keeping in order
just as the liveryman would be ex
pected to keep the horse in order and
hitch him up when wanted.
The runabout does not take the
place of the big cars for heavy work,
but many people who have big cars
and use them for light work, would
save time and money by keeping the
runabout and hiring the big cars on
the special occasions when they are
needed. It is an ideal machine for a
physician, a lady or in fact for any
person whose driving is chiefly around
town or to nearby points in the valley.
One charging of the machine is suffi
cient for eighty miles of travel. An
other feature of it is the electric light
ing, the lights being turned on by sim
ply touching a button.

BLACK HAND AGENT

Ran Against a Man Who Was Not
Afraid

Gary, Ind., June 20. Franco Abolpo,
said to be a member of the Black
Hand, was shot and probably fatal
ly injured by James Sorreullo in the
latter's place of business here today.
Abolpo entered the place with a
note demanding that a certain sum
of money be paid under penalty of the
death of Sorreullo and his wife.
