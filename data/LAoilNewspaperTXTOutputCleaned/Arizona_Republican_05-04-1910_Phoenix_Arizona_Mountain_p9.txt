THE CAREFUL SIFTING OF THE VOTE of July American General

trial took place in the jail this morning.
VERDICT A verdict of guilty was found against
him the first ballot.
Under fire, who had been arrested
on the charge of taking of A. J. Toney and

Deadbeats.

In a verdict of grand larceny in the
theft of a bicycle was announced to

a jury for the territorial prison;

It is reported this term
is arranged at lay consideration of
land. Some Louisiana reputation.
Specifically William, the Apache, convicted
and sentenced and upon his little
family were relieved.
The county court ordered that
the prisoner be remitted to the territorial prison

and under the law J. H. Phillips. Arraigned
for the theft of a pony from an Indian.
In another prosecution of assault with
intent to kill on L. C. Smith of

Sewell. It is alleged the prosecuting
witness for him for retaliation and
the reason for the action. He is now
held until trial.

Eight were miscalled.

On one ward in the jail
the sheriff said yesterday morning of
the prison, he was commended for
the excellent spill of

the defendant. It is of the
time.

THE VALUE OF PROPRIETARY
MEDICINES

are the very large amounts;

Many of the old proprietary medicines
are kept on shelves and are written in
lurid typesetting to meet this fact.
The old time proprietary preparations
are like the famous Pinkham's Vege
table compound, that have served the
need of tired people in every
household. It is most

useful for the effects of female troubles.
It is universally used for those disor
ders, and its value in building up
the system is acknowledged by many.

If you are afflicted with any of the
delicate troubles, Pinkham's help will
be found most satisfactory.

This
is the trade
mark which is
found on every
bottle of the
genuine

Scott's Emulsion
the standard Cod Liver Oil
preparation of the world.
Nothing equals it to build up
the weak and wasted bodies
of young and old: a boon to
all. Ask your druggist for Scott's Emulsion.
Ask for Scott's Emulsion and refuse substitutes.

When the Young Men's Democratic
Club Conducted Elections.

PERSONAL MENTION

Some of the actions of Frank De
Souza yesterday are typical of the
dronning himself causing a stir,
bringing him before the judges of the afternoon it had become apparent to
that some effective observer that a bitter
pill was being prepared for the demo crats
to swallow. The smell of it

was distinctly noticeable at the Hotel Adams
and Captain W. S. Scott
and others. Among them were: J. A. Hellier,
first ballot: W. S. Scott; the other: T. E. Smith;
and many more: S. S. Evans, Omaha;
E. K. Emmett, New York; Henry Taylor,
San Francisco; Porter F. Perry,
Townsend; H. L. Taylor, Congress;
Mr. Smith; H. A. Brand, Los Angeles;
Frank M. Corona, Cal.;
J. Hunt arrived and stated the reason
for his vote was sound.
The Act of Chairman Mace the
said Mr. Uriah.
The meeting was lively.
Mr. Atkins led the discussion.
Mr. J. Hunt made a vigorous
plea for reform in the city.
The meeting closed at 11 p. m.

The usual luncheon was tendered the
delegates at the Hotel Adams.
Among those present: Mr. D. C. White,
Mr. J. P. Parker; E. W. Johnson,
Mr. R. J. Collins; Miss M. Murphy;
Capt. Robt. Barry; Los Angeles.

Frank L. Smith and wife, Los Angeles;
J. C. Hayward and wife, Chicago;
John R. Martin, New York; Mrs. E.
P. Smith and daughter, San Francisco.

Up at times citizens come into and come
out of the main room of the city hall
and say what they intend to do on any
day, whether an election is in progress

or not.

Counseling up of little rooms of the
polls the people immediately came to the conclusion that whisky was being
distributed to all comers, and specially
to any of the class to whom a drink
of real liquor meant a complete chance
of convictions. Accordingly DeSouza
buttonholed Marshal Moore and made

the charge that whisky was being

handed out to any who might thereby
be induced to cast their votes for the
administration candidates.
Without attempting a verbal dispute,
Judge Moore at once

left DeSouza to certify him.

Some of the names: Mr. Blanchard, A. G. Park,
Judge Hanley; Mr. Margett;
Mr. Crocker; Mr. Brandon; Los Angeles;
Mr. T. H. Stuart, Corona; J. D. Hale, Cal.;
and others.

Unexpected and still no liquor was found
and no man was located whom he
might charge was guarding any
such commodity. There remained but
one lone closet to investigate, and

this was locked. In that closet are
kept the brushes and other tools of the
street cleaning department. Marshal
Moore had no key to the closet, but
he directed De Souza to remain there
a minute and keep guard while he
brought Frank Fowler.
When Fowler appeared he produced
the necessary key and threw the closet
door open. Not a trace of bottle or
bus was found and De Souza was
obliged to admit himself beaten.

Marshal Moore stated last evening
that about six years ago, on the occasion of an election, a demijohn
containing whisky was found in the
basement of the city hall and that he
immediately caused it to be broken
and the contents poured into a sewer.
He thought it best to show De Souza
the real state of affairs rather than
permit the incident to go unchallenged. The fifty-foot limit line was clearly
marked about the polling places yes
terday and no lobby was permitted
within that space, officers being de
tailed for the special purpose of see
ing that there were no violations of
this law.
o
MAKING OVER AN OLD HAT.

The Maryla?e School 729 Beacon Street, Los Angeles, Calif.
When the Young Men's Democratic
Club conducted elections.

PERSONAL MENTION

Some of the actions of Frank De
Souza yesterday are typical of the
dronning himself causing a stir,
bringing him before the judges of the afternoon it had become apparent to
that some effective observer that a bitter
pill was being prepared for the demo crats
to swallow. The smell of it

is distinctly noticeable at the Hotel Adams

and Captain W. S. Scott thinks Mr.
De Souza should consider. He

The present styles point to a suc
cessful fixing over of last year's hat.
If the brim is in good condition the
crowns may be covered with flowers
or with weatherproof maline. A black
hat, the crown of which is crushed
out of shape, was covered with a
white maline first, which comes espec
ially for the purpose, and then with
black maline. Another hat, the brim
of which was much the worse for
wear, was covered with flowers. The
flowers were mostly white, with a few
pink rosebuds and violets added for
variety. The flower crown is one
of the most stylish features of the
spring hats and is particularly adapt
ed to the young girl with a fresh com
plexion. I saw a girl renovating her
hat materials the other day and she
touched up some great pink roses,
which most women would have thrown
away because they had lost their
color, with water color paints. They
are now the beauty of a "new" spring
hat.

WHERE THE FLEET ONCE LAY.
"It is a pity to spoil one's impres
sions of Santiago de Cuba by going
ashore," writes a correspondent of the
Bellman. "For seen from the harbor it
is pure delight.
"On one side of us lay the Cuban
navy, the gunboat Pilare, very spick
and span and mounting two six
pounders or some such devastating
battery. On the other side lay a
huge, rusty plated, black Cuban transport
freighter... and beyond lay the town,
with the sunset shining full in its
face, making all its windows wink.
"The walls of the houses white and
pink and pale sea beaten, the ruddy
turrets of the cathedral, the rich
masses of dark foliage standing out
against the dim hills which the sun
set washed with tints of opal and
warm rose pink, made one realize how
true to nature for an hour or day.
