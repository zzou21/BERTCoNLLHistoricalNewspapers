Wall will pitch for the All Stars, and
Wall will manage the All Stars, and
common report has it that the All Stars
will be as classy a baseball team as
ever played in the Salt River valley, the
Fords and Rattlers not excepted. This is
complimentary to Wall, for being such
a large part of the team it will be im
possible to hand the All Stars any bou
quets without at least giving him a
smell of the perfume. Wall has done
enough playing to be able to stand it.
Last night two baseball managers,
Wall and White, walked into the office
of the sporting editor of The Republi
can. Managing teams that will be en
tered against each other for the ama
teur championship of Phoenix, the two
men might have expected to hedge off
to size each other up and get a line,
in a way half curious and half jealous,
on their respective baseball ability,
whereas in reality they were arm in
arm. When they stopped to talk what
Wall said was good enough for White,
and vice versa. Figuratively speaking,
Wall's head was resting on White's
shoulder as they talked to each other
in baseball terms of endearment.
Although it is wrong to precipitate a
disturbance by asking touchy ques
tions, the sporting editor had the nerve
to ask Wall, in the presence of White,
if he expected to wipe the Fords off
the map next Sunday. Instead of start
ing an Irish festival he looked at the
other manager in a friendly sort of
way and replied:
"It's pretty hard to tell what's going
to happen out there at Eastlake park
next Sunday. The All Stars are hard
at work getting ready for the game, and
of course we intend to win if there is
any chance for doing it. As for wip
ing the Fords off the map we would
not do that if we could. The boys are
good fellows and good players, and all
we want is a winning score as for
instance 10 to 0. That would be all
right for us. We wouldn't be piggish
enough to ask for any more."
Here White had something to say
about it and he broke in in familiar
tones to interject a word or two.
"What's the use of talking about
what's going to happen at Eastlake?
Nobody knows. But if there could be
such a thing as getting a tip a little
advance dope on the way the game is
going, it would be safe to say that the
Fords are going to play some ball, and
if they don't win the game, it won't be
their fault."
The sum and substance of the con
versation was that both teams will do
their best to win, but they will contend
in a spirit of friendly rivalry.
Sunday will be the day of the first
appearance of the All Stars. The Fords
will meet the new team at Eastlake,
and there is every reason to believe
that Sunday's will be the best attended
game of the present season. Wall's
reputation as a player will bring out
the inner circle of fans who pooh-pooh
anything but the best, and the others
will come as a matter of course.
The lineup of the two teams follows:

HIS BUSY SEASON.
"How's business?"
"Brisk," answered the druggist. "I
have bought tickets for three picnics
and five excursions today, besides do
nating the ice cream for a lawn af
fair."
The way of the transgressor is soft
enough; it's the place he arrives at
that's hard.

The school is trying to do for the moral and physical
not less than for the intellectual welfare of each boy what
a thoughtful parent most wishes to have done. Contribut
ing to this end are the location of the school, removed
from the temptations and distractions of town or city; the
fineness of the climate, the excellence of its buildings and
other equipment, and the beauty and extent of its grounds
with the wide range of foothills surrounding them. We are
glad to have our patrons and graduates consulted. For
