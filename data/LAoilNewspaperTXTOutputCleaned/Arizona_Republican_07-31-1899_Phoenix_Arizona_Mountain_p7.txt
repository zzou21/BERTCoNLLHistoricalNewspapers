Mines and Mining

The legal division of profits and
property as the result of litigation has
received a fresh illustration in the
case of the Golden Cross mine, San
Diego county, Cal. Originally at
tached by men to whom was due money
for supplies, machinery, etc., the case
dragged on for years, with the custom
ary outcome. Fifteen Los Angeles,
Cal., attorneys get $188,000 in fees;
nine San Francisco attorneys get $156,
000; a San Diego, Cal., law firm gets
$66,000. Then one other Los Angeles
lawyer and two other San Francisco
lawyers get securities said to be worth
$400,000 more. Mining and Scientific
Press.
Qualey Brothers, who have been
working the San Juan mines near Saf
ford for the past two years, have just
in a forty-ton smelter which is about
ready for operation. Superintendent
B. Jones of the G. V. G. & N. railroad
informs the Belt that the Qualeys are
already shipping in coke for the smelt
er. One of the brothers who a short
time ago withdrew from the company,
last week bought the Lone Star mines

in the same district his brothers are
operating in, and will rush develop
ment on these claims. Silver Belt
The Mining and Scientific Press
says: In each instance where the cya
nide process is introduced at first it
may be considered an experiment, for
there are so many factors which have
an important influence on the success
of the operation that no rules can be
established other than those of a most
general character. Among the most

important considerations are the con
dition in which the gold exists in the
ore, size of the particles, whether or
not the material is porous enough to
make extremely fine crushing unnec
essary, the tendency of the ore to
slime, which influences the kind of
crushing machinery employed and has
an important bearing in the construc
tion of the plant. Some ores can be
successfully treated by agitation that
cannot be treated otherwise, some re
quire roasting, others do not. In some
ores the coarser sands and slimes are
separated and are worked separately,
others do not require it, and so on
through a large variety of ores. Care
ful experiments should always be made
in the laboratory on a scale suffi
ciently large to insure their reliabil
ity before a plant is built, or failure
may follow what have been considered
successful laboratory experiments.
D. M. Riordan and John D. Payne
were in Yuma last Tuesday on their way to Tucson from a trip to the King
of Arizona. The mill and cyanide
plant are ready to begin the treatment
of ore and as soon as the new pump
which is on the ground is placed in
the well, active operations will begin.
The mill will probably be started to
morrow. Yuma Sun.
Henry Lampker, the well known
daddy of the Silver King mine, dropped
into Globe Tuesday. Mr. Lampker
was one more solid, diametrical hard
worker than any other man with whom
we are acquainted. He came to the
King in '76; owns thirteen claims in
that district, on which he has done
over 1,000 feet of development work
with his own hands. He is authority
for the statement that the King has
produced over $11,500,000, and was
never worked out, but that there are
untold millions beneath the old work.

POPULAR BUSINESS MEN

faculty for Doing an Enormous
Amount of Work in a Quiet Way.

The journalist who edits a paper during the day and
writes stories or magazine articles at night soon goes to pieces, like Harold
Frederick. It is the same with other professions.
A man may study in the quiet of
his library, but he should devote his
evenings to something different from
his daily tasks. If he must work at
home, let it be in the morning hours
when he is fresh, rather than with a
fagged brain. The principal meal
should be eaten in the evening, and
leisurely digested, and form another
reason why nothing should be done
afterward. Rest should be passive and negative. It may be continuous or taken
at intervals. One person requires rest
and cessation from all exertion, though
he may play cards or billiards or chat
with his family and friends. Another
finds rest in change of occupation, and
can work hard without harm, provided
it is a different kind of labor.
Men who are actively engaged all
day should not seek recreation at the
opera and theater, which are not suf
ficiently restful for excited nerves, but
they need quieter amusements.
Sunday, which should be a day of
rest, as spent by the well-to-do
American, is in a far from hygienic man
ner. He rises late, swallows a hasty
breakfast, dawdles around reading the
bill poster papers or goes to church,
eats a heavy dinner, and after a
nap and a stroll on the avenue, takes
a supper of hot biscuits, rich salads,
cake and preserves. No wonder that
Monday is full of dyspepsia and ir
ritation. Those who spend at least a
part of Sunday in the open air feel re
freshed for their week's work. C. P.
Whittgate in Philadelphia Saturday
Evening Post.

SI HOSKINS'S BOY

He Rebelled Against Fashionable At
tire and Ran Away.

Passenger Agent Drake, on his recent trip to Denver, got hold of a yarn
about Arkansas, from a Little Rock
school teacher who was going to Los
Angeles. This teacher said that below
Little Rock eighty miles was a country
that was a century behind. Children
were not compelled to put on civilized
dress until 21 years old. He said he
went down into that particular section
during the holidays of last winter
hunting. Just as the party got into a
little town that had the only post office
for forty miles a big burly young fel
low, looking a good deal as Adam prob
ably looked when he bossed the gar
den of Eden, came tearing down the
rocky street, swinging his arms and
clawing the rocks and clamoring along,
pursued by three men. One of the
party asked a young fellow who stood
near the wagon, laughing, if that fellow
running was crazy.
"Naw," he said, with a drawl; "that
is Si Hoskins's boy. He's 21 years old
today and they're trying to catch him
to put some clothes on him." Wichita Eagle.

A great business can be conducted
quietly and without fuss and feathers.
It is delightful to observe the suave
and pleasant methods of men in po

daily turn out an immense amount of
work, who see scores of visitors yet
never show irritation. A cheerful man
ner is of immense help. "Courtesy is

FUTURE OF THE RAILROADS
Will Ultimately Be Merged Into a Few
Vast and Powerful Systems
Paul Morton, Vice President of the

Insurance Company, is notable for his
easy dispatch of business and genial
tact.
President Frank Thompson, of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, also possessed
this enchanting trait. He never ap
peared to be in a hurry, and his dispo
sition was wholly free from irritation.
His tact and skill in smoothing rough
places and dealing with difficult peo
ple made him universally popular.
After escorting the Grand Duke Alex
is, of Russia, through the country in
1871, the latter wrote that "Mr.
Thompson was co less agreeable as a
companion than valuable as a mana
ger."
Augustin Daly complained, at a dan
ner given in his honor by the Shakes
peare Society, that engrossing ambi
tions and unsatisfied longings for
higher achievements do not tend to
make a man companionable, sociable
or clubable, while they may sow his
path with small resentments. This is
uniformly true, and a spirit of genial
ity makes life's journey much easier
than Whistler's Gentle Art of Making
Enemies. Mr. Morton seems to be
merged into one by the logic of pre
vailing tendencies, and the thing which
at the present moment seems most
probable is a half dozen or even fewer,
vast corporations owning all the
railroad track, these corporations in
turn to be so completely under the
control and regulation of the govern
ment that they will have little or no
power of their own.
The settlement of the country is so
averse to allowing the railroads to
agree on rates and divide business that
there is hardly the slightest likelihood
that Congress will legalize the pooling
method which the railroad managers
desire. Hence, only two of the contin
gencies named by Mr. Morton are with
in the range of probability. Either the
government must own the railroads
or they will ultimately be merged into
a few rail systems so powerful that
competition will be out of the question,
and if the transportation business
becomes a monopoly. Judging from
present tendencies, that is what will
happen before the sentiment of the
people reaches the stage which would
make government ownership possible.
But such a concentration will never
be permitted without the strictest kind
of governmental supervision. Kansas City Star.
-o-
TELL YOUR SISTER

There is a theory about the particu
larity agents of the government operat
ing the railroads, distributing a rea
sonable amount of the profits of the
business to their security holders and
paying all excesses of earnings into
the national treasury.

Such an arrangement would be
preferable to government ownership,
for it would leave the railroads in the
hands of business men instead of politi
cians. It would avoid the necessity of
an enormous increase in the civil
service, and give the country all the
benefits of stable and uniform rates
as well as the advantages of individual
and corporate enterprise in the devel
opment and extension of the transpor
tation system of the country.

The objection will be urged against
this method that it would impercepti
bly increase the influence of the coun
try. But this plan may be met by the
question whether such an influence
would be as bad as the danger of par
tisan control of the million employees
of railroads under absolute government
ownership. Kansas City Star.

important considerations are the con-
dition in which the gold exists in the

not the material is porous enough to

BIG CORN CROP WILL FINISH

the reason that nothing but an earth
quake would reach it, and "earth
quakes," according to Editor William
Allen White of Emporia, "are not in
digenous to the Kansas soil."
"The corn crop of 1899, which seems
to be looming in threatening propor
tions upon the horizon," says Editor
White, "may make much history and
settle or unsettle principalities and
powers." The people of Kansas are
prosperous. From the abode of pen
ury and pessimism, in which populism
was born, Kansas has become the
home of the money power. The banks
are full of money of the farmer and
the mechanic, and the prevalent rate
of interest in Kansas for farm loans
is 5 and 6 per cent, which is 2 per
cent lower than it was before McKin
ley was elected. All this is disheart
ening enough to populists, but on top
of all this distress comes additional
bereavements in the shape of a gen
eral liquidation of debt.
Editor William Allen White is the
gentleman who discovered "What's
the matter with Kansas" when all
others failed to diagnose the disease.
Any preparations bearing the Kansas
label which have not his name blown
into the bottle are therefore spurious
and are intended to deceive. Editor
White believes it will be a difficult task
to talk free silver to men who have
bulging corn coffers and money in the
banks. He also believes it will be a
hopeless task to talk against expan
sion to fathers whose sons fought with
Funston in the Twentieth Kansas.
In short, Editor White believes that
the big corn crop of 1899, in spite of
the low price that is apt to prevail,
will put Kansas into the republican
column in 1900. Bryanism can make
no headway in Kansas next year un
less an earthquake comes to its relief,
and the earthquake to be of any ben
efit to the cause of free silver must
come very soon. Chicago Times-Her

ARTHUR AND BLAINE

They Were Long on Greenbacks and

Short on Change.

There is a good story of the Presi
dential excursion down to the Eastern
shore of Maryland. The party em
braced Secretaries Blaine and Windom
and others. They were fortunate
enough to hear an excellent sermon
from the venerable Episcopal Bishop
of Maryland, who was there to ad
minister the rite of confirmation.
President Arthur and the two secre
taries sat in quiet satisfaction. Before
their peace of mind was suddenly dis
turbed. The offertory was sung. At
the familiar words: "Lay up for yourselves treasure
on earth," the President and the Secretaries each quietly
slipped a hand into a pocket.
Windom drew forth a crisp one-dollar
note and held it between his thumb
and forefinger, ready for the approach
ing plate. The President and Mr. Blaine
went a little deeper into their pockets.
One brought up a nickel and the other a dime. Their faces
flushed. It would never do to make
such a contribution.
He that soweth little shall reap lit
tle, and he that soweth liberally shall reap plenteously. God loveth
a cheerful giver." The President went to his pocket-book,
and the Secretary of State explored his vest pocket with his nervous
fingers.
"Zaccheus stood forth and said unto
the Lord: 'Behold, Lord, the half of
my goods I give to the poor, and if I
have done wrong to any man I restore
fourfold.'"
The plate was only four pews away.
What the president found in his pocket
book was one fifty dollar note and a
ten dollar greenback nothing smaller.
What Mr. Blaine found was two ten
dollar notes nothing smaller. To put
in a nickel or a dime only was not to
be thought of. To give $10 was more
than either cared to do. Each look
ed at Windom sitting calmly with his
dollar note in hand. He shook his head.
"Charge them that are rich in this
world, that they be ready to give and
glad to distribute."
There was no time for further pocket
exploration or consideration. With
a smile of commiseration at each other
and something like glee on Windom's
placid countenance, the President and
the Secretary of State each planked
down his ten dollar note for "the poor
of the congregation." And the worst
of it is, said one of the party after
wards, that the Lord would probably
give them credit only for the dollar or
two which they intended to give.

LAWYER MET HIS WATERLOO.

Hart Won Many Legal Battles by His
Peculiar Methods but Was Con
quered at Last.

A member of the Kentucky bar nam
ed Simmondson, who was in the habit
of intimidating the opposing witness
es, was once engaged in the trial of a
case involving the title to some farm
lands and a number of countrymen
were called in to testify on the other
side. When Simmondson came to
cross-examine he harassed them in
every imaginable manner and whenever
they would show signs of confusion
would roar on: "What are you hesit
ating for? Are you afraid you may
tell a lie?" If the victim replied "No,"
Simmondson would retort, "I was sure
you didn't fear a little thing like that,"
and if the answer was "Yes" he would
say with a sneer, "Aha, I thought so."
The last witness he took in hand was
a tall, lank farmer with a thoughtful
eye. He had watched the baiting of
his neighbors in dead silence and took
the stand with perfect composure.
Simmondson, evidently set him down
as a lout and when the witness hesitated
over some question a moment later he
fired his favorite shot. "What are you
studying about?" he bellowed. "Afraid
of telling a lie too? I suppose?"
Without any apparent haste the coun
tryman picked up a massive inkstand
and hurled it at Simmondson's head,
striking him on the bridge of the nose
and knocking him senseless. "That's
what I was studying about," he drawled
in the moment of dead silence that fol-
lowed. A tumultuous hubbub ensued,
but everybody was secretly pleased and
the judge fined the farmer heavily for
contempt. He subsequently remitted
the fine.
INGERSOLL'S WHISKEY.

"I am reminded by the death of
Col. Ingersoll of his famous eulogy on
some rare old whiskey that had been
sent him," said a New York man.
He spoke of it as "the most wonder
ful whiskey that ever banished the
skeleton from a feast, and painted
landscapes in the brains of men." Other
glowing description followed, and
when the thing had been printed in
all the papers and admired for its elo
quence and laughed at for its extrava
gant humor, the Colonel was the re
cipient of many letters from distillers
and agents of liquor houses who want
ed him to say that he had been led to
speak this way on account of the
merits of their particular brand of
rye or Bourbon. But the Colonel was
too foxy to be caught this way, and
didn't propose to be trapped into
boosting any special fire-water. He
sent back polite letters, but gave the
writers no satisfaction. A little later
he had a good laugh and took the pub
lic into his confidence in the matter. The truth was that the glorious liquor
he had spoken of so enthusiastically
was a "bit" of his own composition. He
had a dozen or more bottles of the ardent
in the house, and he poured them all
into one demijohn, the mixture result
ing in the stuff that "banished the skel
eton" etc. Kansas City Journal.
