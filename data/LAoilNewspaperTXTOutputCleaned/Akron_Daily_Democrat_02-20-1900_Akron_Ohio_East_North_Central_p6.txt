REST IN ARLINGTON.
WHERE SLEEP THE BRAVE WHO DIED
FOR THE FLAG.
The National Cemetery in the Crown of the National Capital, Where
the Remains of General Lawton Were Buried.
Special Correspondence.
Washington, Feb. 12. The recent interment of the remains of the late
General Henry W. Lawton at Arlington cemetery revives the interest in
that historic and beautiful burial ground of the nation's soldier dead.
There are 80 national cemeteries scattered throughout the country, in
which rest the bodies of about 110,000 men who died for the flag. The government
records for the army do not give any tabulated information as to
the men who died in the service prior to the war with Mexico. There is nothing
official to show the number killed in the war of the Revolution, the war
of 1812 or any of the conflicts before 1846 or any knowledge by the government
of their places of burial. In the early days "the dead buried its dead"
included. There was no easy communication as nowadays between fighting
line and hearthstone, and bodies were buried in trenches or graves on battle
fields or in convenient cemeteries, and no comprehensive records were kept
or made. Coming down to the civil war, the records, so far as the Federal
army is concerned, are far from complete, and in many of the cemeteries
the graves marked unknown greatly outnumber the known.
Arlington, the best known of national cemeteries and the subject of this
letter, has an interesting history, beginning long before it was used as a
cemetery and interwoven with the story of one of the best known families
of the nation. It was originally the Arlington estate, but has sometimes
been spoken of as the Lee homestead. In the back counties there is a hazy
belief that it once belonged to George Washington. This error is due to the
fact that on the death of John Parke Custis, the owner of Arlington, Washington
adopted two of the children of the deceased. One of these, George
Washington Parke Custis, by the law of primogeniture then in force, inherited
the estate, and upon the death of his grandmother, Mrs. Washington, in 1802,
in whose family he had until then resided, he built Arlington House.
Here he spent a long and interesting life, and upon his death, in 1857, he left
a will devising the estate (except 160 acres left to his colored servant, Maria
Burbap) to his only daughter, Mary Randolph Custis, the wife of General
Robert E. Lee, and at her death to her eldest son, George Washington Custis
Lee. The estate was confiscated by the government in January, 1861. The
legal complications and actions at court which followed the close of the
civil war make too long and complex a story to tell here. Sufficient it to say
that soon after the death of Mrs. Lee, which occurred in 1870, suit was begun
to eject the representatives of the United States government who were in
possession of the estate. The cemetery had been laid out in 1863 and thousands
of soldiers had already been buried there by the government, so that when George
Washington Custis Lee won his suit he found himself owner in fee of a very large
burying ground. His only redress would be a long and expensive suit, and he accepted
the offer of the United States and for $150,000 surrendered the home of
his fathers to the myriad children of the pale red man.
Arlington, which consists of about 3,100 acres, is situated in Fairfax county,
Va., on the south bank of the Potomac, just across the river from the
White House. The ground is high, and the view from the high points takes in
all the prominent features of the city of Washington.

at Arlington is the old mansion which
stands upon the highest point in the
cemetery. The mansion is modeled
after the Temple of Fame and bears
upon its frieze the names of Washington, Grant, Farragut and Lincoln and
upon its columns Garfield, Thomas,
Mendo, McPherson, Sedgwick, Heyn
by is the monument to "the unknown"
and just beyond it the beautiful amphitheater, 160 feet in diameter, with
chaste Corinthian rostrum and columns.
A little way from the house to
the south are the graves of George
Washington Custis and his wife. In a
gloomy place under the hill is the resting place of Mrs. Mary Randolph.
It was in this beautiful and picturesque mansion that Robert E. Lee was
wed in 1831 to Mrs. Custis, the daughter of George Washington's adopted
daughter, and here he lived when not away on his country's service. It was
across this threshold he stepped when he unsheathed his sword in support of
the cause which was subsequently lost.
The old house stands just as it stood
75 years ago. Though stripped of its
antique furniture and its invaluable relics of Washington, its precious memories still cling to it. The servants'
quarters, a detached kitchen and other outbuildings are preserved intact. In
a part of the house live the family of
the officer in charge of the cemetery,
the large parlors being reserved for the
use of the public. A register is kept,
upon which 10,000 names a year are
recorded, and on the walls hang maps
of the cemetery and diagrams showing every grave and the names of all
the known dead.
More than 17,000 soldiers who have
died in defense of the flag have their
last resting place in Arlington. Of
these, nearly 15,000 are unknown. Vast
as are these figures, one can easily believe them to be true, for on either side
long, regularly formed rows of white
headstones extend, perspective of green
between lines of white, as far as vision
can reach. The grounds are perfectly
kept. There is no grave that has become sunken, and none is marked by
an elevation of the ground. Smooth
and even is the surface everywhere.
Walk among these stones, and in ten
minutes one may see such typical
American names as Sherman, Whittier, Spalding, Jackson, Lee, Buchanan,
Lawrence, Sheridan, Grant, Randolph and Allen. Plenty of good Irish
names may be seen, too, and German
as well, significant of the valiant part
played in the country's defense by her
adopted sons. Silent witnesses of
war's havoc are all these stones, but
more especially those marked "A Leg"

or "An Arm." One shudders when he
stands beside the spot where in a pit
were thrown the bones of 2,111 unknown
soldiers gathered after the war from the
fields of Bull Run and the route of the
Peninsular, Over
them is a cannon surmounted monument bearing the inscription:
Their remains could not be identified, but their names and deaths are recorded in the archives of
their country, and its grateful citizens honor
them as of their noble army of martyrs. May
they rest in peace.
There are many beautiful and some
magnificent monuments in the cemetery, the most noteworthy of those
lately erected being that over the grave
of Sheridan. Year by year the military
organizations of the different states
are adding monuments, but by far the most impressive memorial
is the imposing granite sarcophagus
over the grave of the 2,111 "unknown."
Unmarked as yet is the spot where rest
the remains of the boys who fell in
Cuba and the victims of the Maine disaster. However, it will probably not
be long before a grateful country will
give such recognition to the memories
of these brave men as may be expressed
in granite and bronze. Here, too,
will have to be set a tablet bearing
that mute word "unidentified."
With each succeeding year the numbers of those who visit Arlington to
bedeck the graves of the fallen heroes
is increasing. Here is the Mecca of
the Grand Army of the Republic. Members of this organization who visit
Washington, no matter at what season of the year, some time during their
stay wend their steps toward the National cemetery. Once inside the inclosure at Arlington, they forget the
present and live only in the past. Who,
though he be old soldier or not, can
walk through Arlington without a
thrilling or recollection and of patriotism
in his breast? Who can fail to be deeply
impressed with the horrors that attend upon war and the frightful price
that humanity has paid for its
advances? Despite the solemnity that over
comes one in a thoughtful mood when
visiting Arlington, it is yet a popular
resort for the citizens and many visitors to Washington during the summer
months. In addition to the magnificent view had from the mansion and
other high points in the cemetery to
which allusion has already been made,
there is much besides the tombs and
the monuments and the mansion to interest and please the visitor. Roads
and paths wind among the oaks, elms,
maples and magnolias, and many clumps
of evergreens and thousands of flowers
and shrubs are on every hand. In the
midst of this verdure and buoyant vegetable life the visitor may find mir
cease from the heat and turmoil of the
Capital City, his emotions tempered by
the tender sentiment that hovers over
the resting places of the nation's dead.
In the years to come there will be
thousands whose footsteps will turn to
ward the grave of Lawton, and loving
hands will pile high in grateful remembrance beautiful flowers upon the last
home of that brave soldier who met
death on the firing line in a distant
land. Sauvie, Hummell.
OIL IN CALIFORNIA.
NEW IMPETUS TO THE INDUSTRY ON
THE GOLDEN COAST.
Experienced Operator from Eastern Fields at Work Around Los Angeles.
Indications of Considerable Oil Value.
Special Correspondence.
Los Angeles, Feb. 7. California is
having an exciting oil boom. The
times of the gold fever and land speculation are recalled. Men and women
by the hundreds and thousands are
buying oil prospects and investing in
the stock of newly formed oil companies. Newsboys, clerks, teachers,
chambermaids, waiters and waitresses
share alike the feverish anxiety to get
rich.
The possession of oil in paying quantities is of the utmost importance to
the welfare of this state. California
produces little coal, and most of the
supply must be imported from the
eastern states, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon or else brought from foreign countries. Thus coal for heating
and manufacturing purposes is expensive. What is needed is a cheap source
of power. To a great extent oil furnishes this deficiency.
The engines of the Santa Fe are run
by oil in southern California. This
company, in a series of experiments,
demonstrated that a given quantity of
oil would run a train about 12 miles
farther than the same quantity of coal.
The existence of oil in this state was
known as far back as 1862. About 10
years later a well was sunk in Pico
canyon, 10 miles from Los Angeles,
and at a depth of 300 feet seven barrels a day were yielded. There is one
well in that section which has since
yielded over 1,000,000 barrels, and the
company which controls it has expended
$500,000 in a refinery near Alameda.
In Ventura county one company owns
a tract of 150,000 acres, and oil in paying quantities has been located,
In 1875 California produced 300,000
barrels of oil, valued at a little over
$350,000. In 1885 the yield was nearly
2,210,000 barrels, and the value was
$2,375,000. In 1891 about 1,500,000
barrels of oil were secured, at a value
of at least $5,400,000. There are about
2,500 oil wells in California at the present time, and new wells are being added almost daily. One expert in this
city recently assured the writer that
three years hence the daily yield of oil
will exceed 40,000 barrels.
Capital from the east is pouring into
California. At least $10,000,000 is invested in the Industry. A considerable
part of this sum has come from such
places as Buffalo and Dunkirk, N. Y.
and Bradford and Titusville, Pa. Dozens of men who once worked among
the oil wells of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio are now employed in this
state. Some are bright young fellows
with plenty of money. Others have
seen better days and hope to recoup
lost fortunes. Many are veterans and
delight to rehearse to listening ears the
story of other booms. They tell of
sudden and lucky strikes and fortunes
made almost in the twinkling of an
eye. The loss of $100,000 seems nothing to these people. One wizen-faced
and bent old gentleman was pointed
out to the writer as once laying out
over $500,000 in the Pennsylvania oil
fields. He is now at work for $2 per
day.
A large number of oil is being secured here in Los Angeles. The wells are
situated out in the Westlake Park district, which is the most fashionable
section of the city. Derricks may be
found on the lawns of private houses
and on vacant lots adjoining handsome
residences. There are about 700 wells
in the heart of the city, and at least 75,000 barrels of oil are produced
monthly.
C. H. Canfield of Los Angeles was an
engineer in a mine five years ago
When it was discovered, he aptly
a young clerk experimented with wells
and began to sink them as business
ventures. The men were successful
and only recently received an offer of
something like $1,000,000 for two of
their wells.
A man named Prescott, who is said
to have made a fortune in the oil regions about Oil City, N. Y. and then lost
all of his money, is out here and is very
successful. H. W. Palmer of Buffalo,
and who was once master of the situation at Titusville, Pa., has a partner in wells in California. Myron A.
Boise of Oil City, Pa., is also at work
in California. He is an ex-banker and
railroad magnate. Wesley W. Porter
was worth less than $100,000 five years
ago, but he now possesses at least
$300,000. There are, it must be understood, extreme cases, for there are
hundreds and thousands who have not been so fortunate.

Mason and Dixon Line.
A bill has been introduced in the
Maryland legislature for the re-establishment
of the boundary line between
Maryland and Pennsylvania, commonly called Mason and Dixon line. The
bill, which appropriates $5,000, requests the superintendent of the United States coast and geodetic survey to
provide for the accurate re-establishment
of the line and to re-mark the
same with monuments.
When the line was originally run in
1767 by two English astronomers,
Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, it
cost more than $170,000. After years
of bad feeling and bloodshed over the
boundary and a fruitless effort to settle it in Loudon, Penn. and Lord Baltimore employed the men named to run
the line. At every fifth mile, of the line
of about 200 miles a stone was planted,
bearing upon one face the arms of
Pennsylvania and upon the side toward Maryland the arms of
Lord Baltimore. The intermediate
pillars were marked with stones bearing M. and P. on the sides facing each
state,
