GREAT REALTY ACTIVITY
IN THE GREAT SOUTHWEST

Pacific Coast States, of
Which Arizona is One,
Planning to Interest the
Landless Man in Manless
Land

(By Harry Welch)
Investigation has decided that agri
culture offers the best opportunity on
the Pacific coast. The inquiry made
in view of the travel which will come
from Europe via the canal has been

most complete. As a result of the
findings the Pacific coast states are

commencing a general planning of
methods for the easy settlement of
the newly-arrived immigrant on the
land. Lands, to be of advantage to
the immigrant who will reach the
Pacific coast via the canal, must be
reasonable in price, and the payments
must not be difficult to meet and
offer a ready means for making a
living.
It is reported that the development
throughout the coast states is greater
in the cities than on the country
lands, and the readjustment of this
condition will be the aim of the com
missions which it is expected will
soon be appointed. It is stated with
certainty that unless the opportuni
ties to settle on lands are attractive
the immigrant will locate in the cities
and towns with no advantage either
to the settler or to the state as a
whole. There is no demand in the
cities for any class of labor, skilled
or unskilled. There is a demand on
large ranches for some help. But the
best opportunity for the immigrant
will consist in securing a few acres
of soil that will produce profitably.
Here is a condition which calls for
the most careful search not only re
garding the possibilities of the soil,
but of the ability of the immigrant
to secure the land upon terms which
he can meet. There will be among
the immigrants arriving via the
canal, those who can and will under
take the hard pioneering which is
not yet all gone. There are pioneer
features connected with bringing
nearby lands under favorable condi
tions for crops.
In the northern coast states logged
off lands have been secured and al
ready the testing out has begun. It
has been found that with real effort
success can be achieved. Families
that have reached those places have
met and surmounted the conditions
and are making good. There are
great opportunities all along the
coast line and there is no reason to
fear the arrival of large numbers of
new citizen material if proper provi
sion for handling and placement are
provided. There will be added incen
tive to irrigation enterprise both pri
vate and under government auspices.
The new people that will come
from Europe will not all be without
money. All they will ask is the best
information regarding the investment
of funds and a reasonable return for
their outlay both of money and labor.
Not only are the coast states inter
ested in this matter of immigration.
There will be great numbers arriving
that will have for their destination
point, some state in the interior, Ari
zona, Utah, Nevada and Idaho or
other western states. The chances
for immigration in all of these states

will be investigated with care on be
half of the immigrant.
So far no report that thousands
are planning to secure passage by
payments on the installment plan,
have been confirmed. The steamship
companies deny these statements and
an investigation by the United States
consular department brings out the
information that tickets are not being
sold in this way.
But there will come many who
upon arrival will have to be mater
ially assisted and more particularly
“guided” in their movements. Every

step that will arrange for the quick
handling of immigrants upon arrival
and the placing of these immigrants

on lands at reasonable prices and on

favorable terms for purchase will
help very materially the state that
makes such provision.
What is required on the coast is a
larger army of producers and the
farmer is the first and greatest pro
ducer in all countries. The best set
tlement of the coming immigration
question is the small farm. The small
tract owned by the operator is the
solution. The community that pre
pares to receive the immigrant must
well investigate its resources in this
particular direction, must see to it
that the soil is right and other con
ditions are attractive.
The reproduction of the best condi
tions prevailing in all parts of Eu
rope is possible in the variety of re
sources of our western states. The
general environment of climate and
country will strongly appeal to the
newcomer and if he is situated so
that prosperity is not hard to attain
he will be well satisfied and become
a strong factor in the progress of
the west.

MEADOWBROOK ACRES
SOUGHT BY CITY WORKERS

OF

PHOENIX HOME BUILDERS

Three-Quarters of Million Invested
Since Company Was Formed by
Greene and Griffin Four Years
Ago.

Few places in the world offer the
same opportunity as this valley for the
city worker to own an acre in the
country and yet close enough to town
for his daily work. Meadowbrook
which is being developed by Greene &
Griffin is one of the many tracts that
give the city worker the chance he
has been looking for. Here the rich
alfalfa provides food for the cow and
the chickens and these features of
country life combined go a long way
towards paying the expense of the fam
ily table. Many instances are on rec
ord where the acre intelligently culti
vated has supported the entire family.
Meadowbrook on account of its car line
convenience is extra desirable as the
tired city worker can step from the car
into his yard. It’s the back to the soil
principle, the desire of all to cut down
the high cost of living, to have the
fresh cream, milk, butter, eggs and
chicken without having to part with
the entire month’s salary. Best of all
is the good health and long life that go
with the country life. Children grow
up strong and vigorous and a credit
alike to the family and the nation. For
these reasons tracts like Meadowbrook
will attract more and more and the city
worker who takes the initiative is the
healthy successful property owner of
tomorrow.

Enterprise in Northern
Phoenix Proposed by
Phoenix Property Owner
Who Has Made Study of
Model Villages of Europe

The remarkable growth of Arizo
na’s first Home Builders is a strik
ing proof of the high standard of its
investments and of the estimation in
vestors have of investments in the
Salt River valley. Paying 8 per cent
on par in quarterly payments of 2
per cent each, this stock has ad
vanced in value from $1.00 to $1.25
and the original investors at $1.00
are now being paid 10 per cent on
their first investment.
A showing like this is sure to at
tract the investors and a further
examination of the various proper
ties in which the Home Builders’
money is invested reveals the gilt

edge type of securities this company

has chosen for its risks. In Chelsea

Place the company under the able
direction of Greene & Griffin have
developed a resident section that is

the pride of Phoenix. Its location
fronting on Central avenue boulevard
is absolutely the best. The grade of
homes cannot be equalled and the
rapidity of its growth is a striking
example of the New Phoenix.
Their investments are also to be
found in Evergreen Place, East Ev
ergreen, Las Palmas, Bonnie View,
and the Capital Addition. Their rep
utation for stability in house build
ing has become general and their
architectural department has design
ed so many homes that are unique,
correct and suitable to the climatic
conditions of the Southwest, with
the result that not a week passes but
plans are being furnished throughout
Arizona, so great has become their
reputation for detail and thorough
ness. Phoenicians may well be pleas
ed to know that today this company
is the largest in the west outside of
Los Angeles. Likewise the record of
this company of having been the
largest builders of homes in the last
four years shows that it is a typi
cal western product, and while keep
ing pace with the progress of Phoe
nix, its conservative management
backed up by a strong board of di
rectors selected from the older bus
iness firms of Phoenix has resulted
in eastern capital being invested
more heavily than is usual in a new
company. The directors have returned this
confidence by a close inspection and
supervision with the result that the
reputation of Phoenix investments
have been benefited by scores of res
idences that would be a credit to the
largest cities in America.
