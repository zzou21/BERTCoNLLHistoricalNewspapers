TICKET OFFICES CONSOLIDATED!
T & W W
PHOENIX FORTUNATE IN CHANGE

There will be no Santa Fe or Ari-
zona Eastern ticket office in Phoenix
after today. In fact, there ceased to be
any yesterday, when the consolidation
of the two ticket offices was begun un-
der the direction of the federal railroad
administration. The consolidated of-
fices will occupy the quarters lately
occupied by the Santa Fe and under
orders from the administration, the
quarters of the Arizona Eastern in the
Hotel Adams will be released on the
best terms possible.
The order for the consolidation was
received a week ago when it was made
known that the recommendations of-
fered by F. P. Crutcher, assistant general
freight and passenger agent of the
Santa Fe and H. C. Hallmark, general
freight and passenger agent of the Ar-
izona Eastern, "had been finally
adopted. Those recommendations had
been made to the western passenger
traffic committee by which they had
been referred, to the regional director
at Chicago, whence the order for con-
solidation was finally issued.
Personnel of Office
The recommendations included the
line-up of the force of the consolidated
office which is as follows:
W. S. Goldsworthy, agent; George
V. Harm, assistant agent; E. A. Kirk-
wood, S. J. Schwartz and Arthur Mc-
Millen, ticket clerks; T. E. Dompsoy,
cashier; O. A. Edwards, operator and
ticket clerk; Bertha Goldsworthy,
stenographer.
Though there will be some shifting
about of the personnel of the present
forces, no one will be left without a
position in the new arrangement.
Mr. Crutcher and A. C. McQueen, live
stock agent of the Santa Fe will move
into other quarters and George YV.
Brown will be in charge of that office.
"U. S. Railroad" Sign
The sign of the Santa Fe will be re-
placed with one reading "United States
Railroad Administration Office," a blue
print of which will be shortly received,
These signs all over the United States
will be of precisely the same style.

They will be as uniform and distinctive
and prevalent as the signs of the
Western Union of the legend, "Cream
of Wheat."
The directions accompanying the or-
der of consolidation are very minute.
They prescribed even the telephone
number of the consolidated office, 4311,
listed as follows:
(a) United States Railroad Admin-
istration Ticket office.
(b) Railroad Ticket Office. United
States Railroad Administration.
(c) Ticket Office. United States
Railroad Administration.
Phoenix is Fortunate
Phoenix has been fortunate in secur-
ing an up-town office. It was rather
more than had been expected, and it
probably would not have been allowed
but for the personal acquaintance of :
Director W. G. McAdoo with local con-
ditions.
It has brought to his special atten-
tion. If it had been left to the com-
mittee which usually decides such mat-
ters, it would almost certainly have
been denied. The committee would
have ascertained that the depots of
the two roads are within a few steps :
of one another; but it would not likely
have inquired into the inadequacy of
facilities at either depot. El Paso,
though much larger than Phoenix, and
more of a railroad center, had great
difficulty in securing an up-town
office.
The delay of a week in the consoli-
dation since the order was received,
was occasioned by the necessity of
checking the two offices out and into
the consolidated office. Accountants of
both roads have been busy and their
work is now complete.
After a three months' search over
the western states Jack W. Worth-
ington, wanted in Phoenix on a
forgery charge, was arrested yester-
day in Salt Lake City. Deputy
Sheriff Charles Nafziger left last
night to get him.
Worthington was formerly em-
ployed by the Goldman Grocery
company as a salesman. Three
months ago he left, taking with him
a number of blank bank checks of
the Goldman company. He went
to Los Angeles from here and is
charged with having forged checks
for approximately $300.
Worthington was traced by the
sheriff's office, the work being un-
der the direction of Lyman LaTou-
rette, under sheriff. While LaTou-
rette was in Los Angeles recently he
received information that led to
Worthington's arrest in Salt Lake
City yesterday.

NO CHANGE IN CONDITION
Contrary to the prevailing impression,
there has been no modification of the
flour restriction regulation of United
States food administration, says Mr.
Micklo of the Arizona Grocery. The
consumer is still required to buy pound
for pound of substitute for all flour
purchased. Large prescribed increases
in the army will require the strictest
maintenance of the regulation. This
also applies to the sugar outlook, and
even greater restrictions are probable.
JOINING COLORS Thomas Law,
manager of the Adams Hotel, has re-
signed and intends to leave the latter
part of the month for Australia, his
home country, where he will enter the
service of his country. Mr. Law lived
in Arizona for 20 years, during which
time he was connected with the Adams
hotel, the Gadsden of Douglas, and the
Dominion of Globe. His place at the
Adams hotel will be taken by Garry
Schuler, who formerly was with the
Hotel Green at Pasadena, and recently
with the Adams hotel.
