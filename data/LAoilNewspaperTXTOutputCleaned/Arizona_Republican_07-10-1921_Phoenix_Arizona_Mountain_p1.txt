Democrats Open Attack On  
New Tariff Bill; Mondell  
Pays Tribute To Repub  
licans Who Drafted  
Measure  

Republican A. P. Leased Wire  

WASHINGTON, July 9.—An old  
straw hat was the article used by  
Democrats in opening their attack in  
the house today on the Fordney pro  
tective tariff bill to illustrate their  
contention that its rates were higher  
than anything written into the Payne-Aldrich  
act a decade ago.  

Representative Garner of Texas,  
ranking Democrat on the ways and  
means committee, in the course of a  
two-hour denunciation of the measure,  
seized the hat as the first object  
within sight and challenged Repub  
lican members of the committee to  
say off-hand what duty had been im  
posed upon it.  

There was a moment's hesitation.  
Then in the midst of a shout from the  
Democratic side, Representative Green,  
Republican of Iowa, arose and brought  
an answering shout from the Repub­  
lican side by announcing that it was  
printed in the bill.  

Ruthlessly waving the faded headgear,  
Mr. Garner declared that in the  
Payne-Aldrich bill, the duty on that  
product was fifty per cent, but in the  
Fordney measure it was $10 a dozen  
plus an ad valorem duty of 20 per  
cent, which made the actual import  
tax, he added, 113 per cent. Compari­  
sons of the two bills, he said,  
would show the same scale running  
through the 146 pages of the Fordney  
measure.  

The average rate of the Fordney  
measure, he added, was higher than  
any ever proposed before by con­  
gress. Attacking the American valuation  
provisions, Mr. Garner charged that  
if it had been applied to the present  
Underwood law, rates now being paid  
would exceed the Payne schedules in  
every instance.  

There were many sharp exchanges  
while Mr. Garner had the floor. Most  
of the verbal battles raged around the  
valuation provision and Mr. Garner  
declared that the most glaring evi­  
dence of how it would shoot rates  
upward was to be found in the case  
of reed furniture, most of which is  
shipped here from Japan.  

“I quote from a letter received  
from a manufacturer at Grand  
Rapids, Mich.,” Mr. Garner charged,  
that because of the peculiar condi­  
tions entering into foreign production  
the reed furniture rate figured ex­  
actly 140 per cent higher than the  
Underwood tariff, which stipulated a  
rate of 15 per cent against the Ford­  
ney fifty per cent.  

With the principal speeches for and  
against the bill out of the way, the  
debate was turned over to members  
generally and it started with a rush  
for an agreement calling for a solid  
week of talk.  

The name of Secretary Mellon was  
brought into the discussion by Rep­  
resentative Oldfield of Arkansas, a  
Democratic member of the ways and  
means committee, who described the  
treasury secretary as one of the  
“beneficiaries” of the high tariff. He  
said that “the Mellons of Pittsburg  
control the aluminum industry of the  
United States,” and called attention to  
the increase in the duty to five cents  
a pound on aluminum.  

“Of course,” he added, “I am not

This Is the Way to Make  
Every Buy a Bargain  

BUY advertised goods. Only good goods,  
fairly priced, can stand the spotlight of  
publicity.  

A merchant or manufacturer would not dare  
to advertise merchandise that is poor in quality,  
poor in make or that will not give reasonable  
wear. The penalty of such tactics is too heavy.  
No goods and no business concern can thrive  
under the weight of public condemnation.  

A merchant places the whole reputation of  
his business at stake every time he advertises.  
Naturally enough, he is careful of what he says,  
and when his statement is placed in the news­  
paper where everyone in town may read, so  
that any untruth in it will be known to all of  
his employees and most of his friends—then you  
may be sure he is doubly careful.  

When you buy advertised goods you get a  
bargain because they must be as advertised.  
So it pays you to read advertisements. Ad­  
vertising protects you.  

Read the advertisements in this paper and get  
the best of the bargain.

**Chief Executive Holds Conference On Yacht Cruise**  

Republican A. P. Leased Wire  

WASHINGTON, July 9.—The pres­  
ident and Mrs. Harding left Washing­  
ton late today for a week-end cruise  
on the presidential yacht Mayflower  
in the lower Potomac and Chesapeake  
Bay. At the president's request the  
presidential salute and all other mili­  
tary honors were omitted at the navy  
yard as the yacht left. It is not  
planned to go ashore during the trip,  
which will end here Monday morning.  

The guests of Mr. and Mrs. Hard­  
ing on the Mayflower included Secre­  
taries Weeks and Davis, Postmaster  
General Hays, Senator Watson of In­  
diana and Mrs. Watson, Senator Kel­  
logg of Minnesota and Mrs. Kellogg,  
Senator Newberry of Michigan, Sena­  
tor Hale of Maine and Chairman Lasker  
of the Shipping Board.  

During the cruise the president  
probably will work on the special  
message he will send to congress next  
week regarding the bonus legislation.  
He will also talk over Shipping Board  
problems with Mr. Lasker. The Ship­  
ping Board chairman was to have  
conferred with him here today, but  
the conference was transferred to the  
Mayflower instead.
