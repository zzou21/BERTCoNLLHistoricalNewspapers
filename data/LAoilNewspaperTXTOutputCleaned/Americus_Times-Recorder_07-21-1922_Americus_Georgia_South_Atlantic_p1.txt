PRESIDENT CALLS HOPPER TO WASHINGTON

MAN'S SINK

IN desperation

extremities of Russia has
n- to cannibalism, according to a
letter received in this city by a friend
' f I \ Trofimov, a Russian resident
The friend, fearing the Red,
refuses to allow his name to be made
public. Stories so horrible as to challenge
belief are in the letter—stories of
mothers killing, cooking and eating
their children; of dead bodies rotting
in the streets; of a hopeless, despair
ing nation. ,
The letter, smuggled past the strict
mail censorship in possession of a
mutual friend leaving Russia, brands
life in the Soviet nation as a terrible
nightmare, daily growing
worse. . . ,
“Of the horrible pictures the letter
paints are true,” says Trofimov,
who fled from Russia under forged
passports in 1918. He had served in
the Russian navy under the czar,
Kerensky, and for a short time, under
Lenin, and was a submarine
commander in active service during
the war.
“I, myself saw the beginnings
which inevitably led to this. But
there will be a reaction, probably resulting in the return of monarchy.
Lenin Conservative.
“Lenin, the one sincere man of the
Bolsheviki, is conservative in his
radicalism. If he dies, as the papers
say is likely, men more radical will
get control and the peasantry will
rise against them. Then, probably a monarchy, for the people of Russia
do not know of a good republic such
as America. All they know is
Sovietism and monarchy, and between the two they will choose monarchy.
“What else will they do when there
is no food, no hope of food and
scarcely a house in Russia fit to live
in? The wooden buildings are torn
down for firewood, the brick buildings are tumbling down. Unrepaired
roofs admit the water, which
freezes between the bricks of the
walls and causes them to become dis
lodged. People lie like animals in
the basements. All this because the
houses have no owners and who
cares if they tumble?
Cannibalism? Yes, I believe it,
for when I left Russia everyone was
consuming and no one producing or
planting. This would bring the terrible desperation of hunger which
well might lead to cannibalism.”
Text of Letter
The letter follows:

CLAY WINNER OF
GOLFING NOVELTY
Young Player Turns In Net Score
Of 91 1-4 On Re-Arranged
Course
Several new names broke into the
list of winners in the cross country
golf event at the Americus Golf club
Thursday afternoon. The event was
a distinct novelty. The order of the
course was entirely re-arranged,
sending the players for 18 holes over
parts of the grounds and for longer
distances than heretofore experienced.
Many hazards not interfering
with play by the usual route were
encountered, and many players
found themselves frequently in serious
trouble.
The winner of first prize in the
men’s section was Henry Clay who
turned in a net score of 91 1-2, a
splendid showing under the conditions. He was given a new golf club.
Middleton McDonald was second with
a net of 95, receiving a prize of four
new golf balls. Sam Coney, with
a net of 96 1-4, was third, and received three balls. H. O. Jones was
fourth with 100 1-4 and W. D. More
land and Arthur Rylander, Jr., tied
for fifth, these three being given two
golf balls each.
In the ladies section, Mrs. W. G.
Turpin was first with a net score
of 122. Mrs. John Council came second with 122 3-4, Mrs. W. D. More
land was third with 124 and Miss
Mary Glover fourth with 129 1-4.
The prizes for the ladies were four,
three, two and one golf balls.
These weekly holiday afternoon
events are proving of much interest
to the golfers, furnishing a novelty
that adds to the attraction of the
game.
DICK RUSSELL EXPECTED
TO DROP OUT OF CONTEST
ATLANTA, July 21.—Judge Dick
Russell, who paid his entrance fee
in the race for chief justice against
Judge W. H. Fish, has never made
a formal announcement, and there is
now some doubt about his doing so.
The judge has not received much encouragement in his effort to oust a
member of the court who has been
on the bench for the past twenty
five years and who has been chief
justice for seventeen years.

AMERICUS, GEORGIA, FRIDAY AFTERNOON, JULY 21, 1922.

GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER!

OWN STATEMENT
CLEARS CASHIER,
ACCUSED BY 12
Wrennick, of Ty Ty Bank, Ac
quitted, Despite Elaborate
Prosecution
TIFTON, July 20. The case against
H. L. Wrennick, former cashier of
the Bank of Ty Ty, which occupied
two days in Tift Superior court, went
to the jury shortly after 4 o’clock
Thursday afternoon. Two hours
later it returned a verdict of not
guilty. Wrennick's wife and three
children were sitting beside him
when the verdict was read. After
the jury was discharged court adjourned for the term.
Wrennick was charged with embezzling $4,000 from the bank. The
principal witness for the state was
J. C. Campbell, auditor for the Benton system of banks. He was on the
stand about six hours and underwent
a grueling cross-examination. He
testified that he checked up Wren
nick and found him short over $5,
000 in various amounts including interest, collections unaccounted for,
overdrafts, etc. Campbell’s testimony was supported by that of J.
B. Downs, auditor for the bonding
company.
Wrennick was the only witness in
his own behalf and his statement occupied about two hours, embracing
nearly 15,000 words. He flatly denied any shortage, said he did not
take a nickel, and claimed that a
real audit would show that the bank
had saved money under his administration. He charged that when he
went into the bank as cashier he
found it in bad condition; that the
directors were violating the law, by
overdrawing their accounts and borrowing money from the bank without proper security and that when
he called the attention of Mr. Benton and later the state banking department to this, the directors conspired to oust him. He said he had
tried to build up the town and that
any doubtful loans he might have
made were to enable customers to
keep their property from being sold
for taxes. He alleged that the
amount of cash claimed as short was
never in the bank at one time.
In rebuttal several of the directors
of the bank testified as to the condition of their accounts and security for money borrowed, and several citizens testified as to Wren
nick’s acknowledging a shortage of
not more than $1,000. It was also
testified that in the meeting of the
board of directors when Wrennick
was discharged he became enraged,
calling them snakes and a number of
other bad names. A total of thirteen
witnesses were sworn in the case besides Wrennick’s statement.
Mrs. John Irving Gossett and little
son, Billy, who have been guests for
a month of Mrs. Gossett’s mother,
Mr. F. A. Thomas, will leave Saturday for their home in Atlanta.

TROOPS MOVE TO
COAL DISTRICTS
TO GUARD MINES
Preparations Made In Ohio And
Pennsylvania To Re-Open
Properties
COLUMBUS, July 21.—Ohio National
Guardsmen are stationed today at Cadiz and Lancaster, two
strategic points in the coal producing districts, ready for any emergency which may arise in connection
with carrying out the president’s
protection plan for the operation of
the coal mines.
PENNSYLVANIA TROOPS
MOVE INTO COAL DISTRICTS.
HARRISBURG, July 21.—Penn
sylvania cavalrymen and machine
gunners were moving into Cambria,
Washington, Somerset and other
counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania today to prevent disorder,
when the bituminous mines are re
opened. The whole power of the
state government is being massed
behind them.
KIWANIANS AND LIONS OF
CORDELE IN JOINT PICNIC
CORDELE, July 21.—The joint
picnic given here Thursday by the
local Lions and Kiwanis clubs
proved a profitable as well as a
very happy occasion for fully 300
people, made up of the members of
the two clubs with their ladies and
about 200 farmers from the various
sections of Crisp county as invited
guests. Practically every organization of the city and county was represented; including the various farm
bureaus and associations, the city
and county boards of education, the
city and county officials, the ministers and the county and home
demonstration agents.
Thirty minutes of community
songs preceded an ample and appetizing barbecue which was served at
the noon hour.
The afternoon program was initiated by Chairman McArthur of the
Kiwanis club, and master of ceremonies, with an appropriate word of
welcome. He was followed by Palmer Green, of the Lions, with an expression of welcome. Then followed pointed discussions dealing mainly with agricultural problems and
progress in this section for the past
year or two by representatives and
officials of the several farm organizations of the county. These were
especially interesting as they included many new phases of farming
which are still in an experimental
stage in this county. The occasion
was one that would be hard to duplicate in fine feeling and wholesome
fellowship and will undoubtedly go
a long way in establishing hearty cooperation among all interests in the
future development and progress of
Cordele and Crisp county.

PRICE FIVE CENTS

Mrs. Albert Meadows, 20, widow

LESLIE DEFEATS
ROCHELLE 6-5
Takes Second Game Of Series On
Cordele Diamond—Hines Is
Yanked
LESLIE, July 21.—Leslie won an
exciting game from the Rochelle team
yesterday at Cordele by a score of 6
to 5. Leslie scored 3 runs off Har
rell in the first inning and Hamilton
succeeded him on the rubber. “Skinny” Hines started for Leslie and was
not in the best of form, but was given poor support, so after 5 runs
had been scored off him in 4 innings,
Bradley succeeded him. Bradley was
not scored on for the balance of the
game. Leslie tied the game in the 8th
inning with a single by Bass and a
home run by Mercer Deavours over
left field fence, and in the 6th inning
won the game.
Leslie plays in Rochelle today and
Buena Vista plays in Leslie Tuesday,
July 25.

PRESIDENT NOT
DETERRED OVER
PEACE FAILURE
OF SENATORS
Summons Head Of Labor Board
For Discussion Of Situation In
Rail Dispute
WASHINGTON, July 21. (By
Associated Press.) —President Harding, undeterred by the failure of the
members of the senate Interstate
Commerce committee to obtain from
the leading Eastern railway executives a basis for settlement of the
shopmen’s strike, today invited
Chairman Hooper, of the United
State Labor Board, to Washington
for a discussion of the strike situation.
Chairman Hooper left Chicago
during the day for Washington.
The president was advised by
Chairman Cummins and Senators
Watson and Kellogg, of the Interstate Commerce committee, of unavailing efforts made by them in
conference with several leading
Eastern railroad executives last
night to obtain a basis for settlement of the railroad strike. The
senators declined to discuss their
report prior to its presentation to
the president. On leaving the White
House they said they merely had
made a report. It was said future
conferences “probably” would be
held.
TELEGRAPHERS ASKED

ST. LOUIS, July 21.—(By Associated

one day’s pay to help the cause of
the striking railroad men and coal
miners.
LOOKS MORE LIKE
FIGHT TO FINISH.
CHICAGO, July 21.—(By Associated
Press.) —The strike of railway shopmen today bore an increasing external appearance of a finish
fight between the union men and the
rail heads. Speculation turned to
what might be the next step by the
federal government to keep up
transportation.
CHILE AND PERU IN
EXAMPLE TO WORLD
Washington, July 21. (By
Associated Press.) —In an environment already rendered historic by

small nations came together here today in the hall of the Americas in
the Pan-American Union building
to witness consummation of a new
example of international conciliation furnished by Chile and Peru
in their agreement to arbitrate their
forty year old controversy over
Tacna-Arica.
After the plenipotentiaries of Peru and Chile had signed the agreement, the conference finally adjourned at 12:19 o’clock.
