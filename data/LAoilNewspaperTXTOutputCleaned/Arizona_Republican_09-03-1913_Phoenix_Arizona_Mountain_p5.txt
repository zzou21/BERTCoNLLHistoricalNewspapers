COL. LAMSON RETURNS
FROM HIS VACATION

It Was Spent in Best Place in the
United States: Northern Arizona

Col. E. M. Lamson, president of the
Lamson Business College, is again
at his desk at the college office after

a vacation of twelve weeks spent in
northern Arizona. He left Phoenix
with the Studebaker people on June
12th, and has spent most of the sum
mer in the vicinity of Iron Springs
and Prescott, with the exception of
two weeks when he took a motor trip
with his daughter and son-in-law,
Mr. and Mrs. D. M. B. Peatross, to
the Grand Canyon, Flagstaff, Oak
Creek, Camp Verde, etc.

He thinks without doubt that
northern Arizona has the finest sum
mer climate of any place in the
United States. He found that a per
son could find a climate that exactly
suited him. Iron Springs is dry and
quite cool; Prescott is not quite so
cool; on the rim of the Grand Can
yon it was cooler and just as dry;
at Flagstaff it was cold with consid
erable dampness; at Oak Creek it
was cold and very damp, raining al
most every day, light showers, and
it was seldom the dew was off the
grass before noon.

He visited all the places of in
terest in the vicinity of Flagstaff,
making George Alkire’s summer home
his headquarters.

One thing that surprised him was
the apparent ignorance of the north
ern residents about the condition of
the roads outside of their own im
mediate vicinity. He was told that
the road from Prescott to Camp Ver
de was almost impassable for auto
mobiles, but with the exception of
five or six miles at the south end
of the state road, the road was just
as good as any of the other roads
north of Ash Fork.

Although Colonel Lamson was tak
ing a “real vacation,” not talking
business, he found many who volun
teered the information that they in
tended to attend the Lamson Busi
ness College the coming school year.
He found also many former students
in good positions or in business for
themselves. It is needless to say that
they were very glad to see him and
he was glad to know that they were
prosperous.

SUPERVISORS APPROVE
BID FOR ROAD BONDS

Regular Monthly Meeting Held and
Much Routine Business
Transacted

At the regular monthly meeting of
the board of supervisors, which was
held yesterday, work was ordered
done on most of the roads of the
county and it was specified that it be
finished in time for the opening date
of the Fair. The bids for the road
bonds for District No. 1 were opened
and the bid of E. J. Bennett was ac
cepted. The money thus raised will
allow the county to work hand in
hand with the city in the paving of
the McDowell road and when it is
finished it will form an important
link in the road system around
Phoenix. Work was ordered done on
the Yuma road as far west as Agua
Caliente so that the road will be
in good condition for the auto race from
Los Angeles to Phoenix. Work was
also ordered done on the roads east
of Phoenix as far as the county line
so that the El Pasoans will have
smooth sailing for their race.

After the meeting Chairman Mouer
and Lin H. Orme went to inspect the
Tempe bridge; on their return
they reported that work was progress
ing rapidly and that the road would
be finished in time for the fair. The
Arizona Paving Company, which
has the contract for the bitulithic paving
of the floors of the bridge, has been
somewhat delayed owing to the non
arrival of some very important pav
ing machinery, but as soon as it ar
rives the floor will be put down in a
very short time. The new machinery
will lay the floor more smoothly and
it will last a longer time than when
put down by the old method.

All the bills presented to the meet
ing were ordered paid and the super
visors expressed themselves as satis
fied with the progress of the work
of the different county officials. The
acceptance of the bid for the road
bonds of E. J. Bennett was ratified
and the checks of the unsuccessful
bidders were ordered returned. The
bonds were sold to Mr. Bennett for
par. Road bonds do not as a rule
command such high prices as school
bonds.

REPORTS OF WEATHER OFFICE SHOW IN
TERESTING NUMBER OF CLOUDY
DAYS BUT LITTLE RAIN

August, after the custom of Au
gusts most everywhere, was pretty
full of weather. This is borne out in
the monthly weather report, issued
yesterday by the United States
bureau here, Robert Briggs, section
director.

In the first place, August was not
such a hot month, after all. On fif
teen days the record went to or over
a hundred, but the average was low.
But three years of the seventeen
since the record has been kept went
so low in mean temperature, which
was this August but 86.7. The nor
mal for the months has been 89.
Sixty-eight on the fifteenth and six
teenth is the lowest temperature re
corded.

There was a total of half an inch
of rainfall here for the month. This
is very low, considering the condition
of the surrounding country. In all
directions there have been great
storms within the past few days, and
even the desert near Yuma, and to
the northward is drenched and sod
den. There was a deal of cloudiness
for so dry an August. But a dozen
days out of the 31 are reported clear,
while the rest are either entirely or
partly overcast. Eleven days out of
the month have thunderstorms
chalked against them, which is an
unusual number. This shows that al
though Jupiter Pluvius was on the
job frequent and considerable, his
bark was far worse than his precipi
tation. No other miscellaneous phe
nomena are reported, such as snow,
hail, eclipses, halos around the sun
and moon and auroras. Aside from
that, it's been pretty pleasant here.
Wind didn't count for much, al
though there were a couple of nifty
sand storms of the regular old time
variety. The prevailing direction was
southwestward, and the velocity aver
aged 5.3 miles per hour, for a total
of about 4,000 miles.

CURIOUS STORM
IN GRAND CANYON

Phenomenon Seldom Seen Witnessed
by a Phoenix Man.

Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Stacy have re
turned from an automobile trip to the
Grand Canyon. Mr. Stacy cannot say
so much for the excellence of the road
all the way as he can for the scenery.
His automobile turned turtle on Yarnell
hill and he found rough going in other
sections of the route.

But the tribulations the overland
traveler undergoes, he says, are re
paid by the grandeur of the scenery at
the canyon which he saw at its best.
In fact he saw something that not one
person in ten thousand who have vis
ited the canyon has seen and which
residents there say is seldom witnessed.

A week ago while standing near the
Grand View Hotel, he saw a mass of
clouds rolling up the canyon. They
appeared to be tumbling over each
other. At a point opposite the Grand
View, the clouds turned against the
precipitous side next the hotel and then
began rising and emerging from the
canyon in volume as large as a city
block. They seemed to be trying to
crowd by each other in a hurried es
cape. At a height of about one hun
dred feet from where Mr. Stacy was
standing they turned loose and poured
a torrent into the canyon. Those who
were standing on the rim not more
than a hundred feet away, dry-shod and
dry overhead, witnessed for a long time
this curious downpour.

GREAT
BAIKANIS ARE
WITH BIG CIRCUS

Remarkable Company of Equestrians
to Give Sensational Perform
ances in Phoenix

The biggest offering in years, in
the way of equestrian acts, is found
on the long program which Ringling
Brothers are giving this year. This
new European sensation is the fam
ous Baikani family of riders, who for
many seasons have electrified the
audiences in the winter indoor cir
cuses of Germany and France by
their wild and dangerous exploits on
the backs of unbroken horses. The
act is one of this season’s headliners
and is sure to prove a thriller of
the first degree. There are six peo
ple in the act, and they are known
as Oriental riders, though their style
smacks of the western cowboy of
early days, with the spectacular Or
iental dress.

The Larboer troupe of jugglers are
presenting another imported novelty,
absolutely new in conception to the
people of America. There are four
in the company, one being a woman.
Instead of the ordinary balls and
plates used as objects in the juggling
acts familiar to the circus goers of
this country, these European artists
juggle each other with a skill and
display of strength that is amazing.

Still another sensation, which is
entitled to the name “thriller” is of
fered by the Janowsky family, who
with the use of a springboard do an
acrobatic and gymnastic act that is
startling. The three Jahns present
a balancing ladder specialty that is
new to Americans; the Portia Sisters,
four in number, offer a novelty in
contortion feats, and the Maryland
troupe of English acrobats show an
amount of skill and training that is
a revelation as compared to our own
methods.

The Saxon trio of the strongest
men of the world are the top-liners
of the extraordinary program. Their
feats in strength rival the stories of
old. Certainly not in modern times
have such giants lived. All the
world’s records are broken by them
at every performance. The eldest
brother with one hand lifts 312
pounds high above his head—a lift
exceeding by nearly 80 pounds all
previous records. At the conclusion
of the act two of the brothers form
the pillars of an immense bridge over
which passes an automobile with ten
passengers.

The big circus will visit Phoenix
next Monday week, giving exactly
the same performance in every detail
as those presented at the Coliseum
building in Chicago where the show
opened the season in April, and
where night after night and day after
day for three weeks the vast aud
itorium was packed to the doors.
The morning street parade, the
opening spectacle of Joan of Arc, en
acted on the largest stage in the
world by 1,200 characters, the new
menagerie and the various other
departments of the world’s greatest
shows are this year attracting more
attention than ever before.

The New Suits Are Ready
Varied and Charming in Design

Season after season, year in and year out, Phoenix’ fashionable folks
have watched the New York Store’s announcements—have taken careful
note of the styles shown in the New York Store windows—have kept
close touch with this establishment, in order to be familiar with what
ever was best in new style thoughts.

The last few days have brought to us various express shipments of
new suits in absolutely authentic styles—modes that should inform you
of what’s what for the coming season.

Early Fall Models
Introducing New Ideas

Exclusive, individual in every detail, notable for mater
ials, trimmings and new fashion lines as well as for perfect
workmanship.
Rare models, strictly tailored—but one suit of a kind.

Among the most prominent materials are Diagonal Chev
iots, Matlasse, Bedford Cord, Boucle Mixtures, Eponge and
Whipcords.

The new shades represented in this showing are maho
gany, The Hague blue, wistaria, cinnamon, copper and taupe.

The coats are 36 to 42 inches long in the back, designed in gen
eral along very decided cutaway lines, with short or medium
long fronts running to very long backs with rounding, square
or the new Spade finish from 1- to 8-Button Models are included.
The skirts are high waist models with draped and
side slash effects or inverted seams front and
back in the more severe styles.

The values in these suits are just as impressive
as the styles—$25.00 to $39.00.

SWIM RECORD BROKEN Bill
Corpstein broke the feature swim rec
ord in the Y. M. C. A. tank yesterday
when he clove the water the length of
sixty feet in 11 1-5 seconds. The previ
ous mark was 11 3-5 seconds held by
“Frenchie” King.

OFF TO FORESTRY CONVENTION
L. S. Blackman, city forester and M.
H. Sharp, park superintendent will
leave tonight for Pasadena to attend
an annual convention of city foresters
in that city.

FINANCES AND
MARKETS

(ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH)
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.—It was a for
midable list of depressing influences
with which the stock market had to
contend today. When trading was re
sumed after the triple holiday, there
was an outpouring of New Haven fol
lowing the news of today’s wreck which
depressed that stock nearly three
points to 90 1/4, a new low record. An
other bear factor was the unexpectedly
poor bank statement of Saturday. July
reports of the railroad systems empha
sized that July results had been dis
appointing. Both Pennsylvania and
New York Central reported increases
in gross earnings, but heavier operat
ing expenses.

As the day advanced the market re
ceived a further setback from the gov
ernment cotton report, disclosing a loss
of condition larger than was expected.
Another move against the so-called
anthracite trust by the government in
the way of a suit against Reading de
pressed the coalers.

In the face of these influences, the
stock market lost comparatively little
ground. Prices were bid up sharply at
the outset, under lead of coppers which
benefited by the advancing tendency of
the metal market. London buying,
estimated at 20,000 shares, helped put
up prices. Canadian Pacific was
marked up four points. Harrimans,
Amalgamated, Chino and Utah Copper
and various other stocks went up a
point or so. Early gains were lost as
day’s unfavorable news developed and
the tone grew heavier. New York
Central was especially weak, falling
back three points. The close found pric
es in most cases under Friday’s last
figures.

Bonds irregular. Total sales, par
value $1,650,000. United States bonds
unchanged on call.
