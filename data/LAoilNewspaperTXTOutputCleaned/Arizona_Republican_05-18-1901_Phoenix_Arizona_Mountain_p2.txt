PHOENIX, ARIZONA, MAY 18, 1901.

The Phoenix and Maricopa county
board of trade has commenced the
collection of mineral
ARIZONA specimens and samples
MINERAL from all parts of All
EXHIBIT. arizona to be displayed at
its rooms for the bene
fit of visitors interested in the mining
wealth of this territory. This is an
enterprising movement whose success
is dependent upon a hearty response
by Arizona mine owners. The great
mineral resources of the various coun
ties should be brought to the atten
tion of the many visitors whose stop
over in Arizona is simply at Phoenix.
There are no producing mines so close
to Phoenix that they may be reached
conveniently by visiting parties who
have but a few hours to spend in this
city. As lasting an impression, al
most, can be made on visitors by an
excellent exhibit of minerals, and in
many cases a good ore collection will
stimulate enough interest among visit
ing mining men to induce them to visit
other regions in Arizona.
The recent action of the board of
trade is broad-gauged and liberal, in
asmuch as it is calculated to adver
tise other counties of Arizona, while
it derives its principal support from
this county. Agricultural industries of
the Salt River valley, however, largely
dependent upon the mineral industry,
can be encouraged by creating adver
tisement for new mining districts. The
introduction of foreign capital into the
mining regions, or at least those trib
utary to Phoenix, invariably, inures to
the benefit of the agricultural interests
of this valley.
S. P. Clark, representing the board
of trade, went before the chamber of
commerce of Denver a year ago in an
effort to bring about an interchange
of visitors between Phoenix and Colo
rado. The result was a series of ex
cursions from Denver to this city, and
each excursion was given principally
for the purpose of interesting Colorado
men in mining in Arizona. Some of
the visitors had but a few days to
spend in Phoenix, and they received a
very incomplete conception of the
mineral resources of Arizona. It was
those people who complained of the
absence of a representative exhibit in
Phoenix calculated at least to en
lighten visitors upon the character of
ores found in Arizona mines.
Secretary L. H. Hamilton of the
board of trade, has received and classi
fied a number of specimens and sam
ples, and installments of ores are ar
riving daily. He has sent communi
cations to various mine owners and to
the press throughout Arizona, giv
ing his views considerable at
tention. His efforts, thus far, have

NO MAN IS STRONGER
THAN HIS STOMACH.

The stomach is the vital center of the
body. It is the organ from which all
other organs are fed. A weak stomach
means a weak man. There never was a
strong man with a weak stomach. What
is called "weak stomach" is in general a
diseased condition of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition,
which prevents the proper digestion of
the food which is taken into the stomach,
and so reduces the nutrition of the
body. When all food is taken away the
body starves. When the food eaten is
only digested and assimilated in part it
only nourishes the body in part, and so
the body is partly starved. And this
starvation is felt in every organ of the
body dependent on the blood which is
made from food.
The great variety of the cures per
formed by Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery is due to its remarkable
power to heal diseases of the stomach
and allied organs. It cures through the
stomach diseases seemingly remote, but
which have their origin in a diseased
condition of the stomach and the other
organs of digestion and nutrition.
"Weak" heart, lungs, kidneys and weak
ness of other organs are cured with the
cure of the weak stomach.
Mr. Thomas A. Hurst, Box 109, Sub-Station
C, Columbus, Ohio, writes: "I was taken very
sick with severe headache, then cramps in the
stomach, and food would not digest, then kidney
and liver trouble, and my back got weak so I
could scarcely get around. The more I doctored
the worse I got until six years passed I had be
come so poorly I could only walk in the house
by the aid of a chair, and I got so thin I had
give up to die, thinking that I could not be
cured. Then one of my neighbors said, 'Take
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and make
a new man out of yourself.' The first bottle
helped me so I thought I would get another, and
after I had taken eight bottles I was weighed
and found I had gained twenty-seven (27) lbs.
in about six weeks. I have done more hard
work in the past eleven months than I did in
two years before, and I am as stout and healthy
to-day, I think, as I ever was."

met with quick response in every instance, although it was believed at
first that some of the largest mines
might not care to display their ores.
A few mine owners, learning of the
plans, sent ore samples of their own
volition. Strong hope is expressed, not
only by those, locally interested in min
ing, but by local business men, that
every mineral region of Arizona will soon be represented by a display at
the board of trade rooms of ores char
acteristic of its region.
The music in the saloons last night
was permeated with a strain of sad
ness. The "Ooo Ooo
THE Eyes," "My Honolulu Lady," "A Hot Time In
SADNESS. the Old Town Tonight,"
"The Georgia Camp
meeting," and those other vivacious
melodies with which the thirsty popu
lation of Phoenix were wont to be en
tertained, gave way to those more som
ber harmonies, which are associated
with partings and farewells, such, for
instance, as "I Can Not Sing the
Old Songs." Early this morning there
was a wail of "The Harp That Once
Through Tara's Halls," etc. The city
council has done its deadliest. It was
a democratic council, but it would
have been the same if it had been a
republican council. Both ends were
being played against the middle.
The Republican calls the attention of
the city council, and of citizens gen
erally, to the deplorable fact that our
naturally beautiful city is practically
devoid of parks. The court house, city
hall and capitol plazas are not parks.
The West End park is the only one
maintained in the city limits, and it
is not much to boast of. Right now,
in our youthful days, when land is cheap
and desirable locations abundant, is
the time to lay plans for park adorn
ments. Parks of from ten to one hun
dred acres should be laid out, east, west, south and north, and connected
by broad boulevards. Little green
places should be planned in various
parts of the city shady spots adorned
with flowers and shrubbery and replete
with cosy loitering places.
It is reported that oil has been dis
covered at Texas Hill, a desert station
on the Southern Pacific railroad, eight
miles east of Yuma. Crowds are going
in from Tucson, Yuma and mining
camps surrounding the place. Twenty-five miles of land have been located,
beginning at Texas Hill and extending
along the Gila river. Two companies
have been organized in Tucson to sink
wells. California experts report fa
vorably. The indications are reported
to be encouraging, and some oil has
been found in the formation. There
is also excitement in the San Pedro
valley, near St. David, where oil was
encountered on a ranch where a well
was being sunk for artesian water. The
rancher abandoned his work because
of the oil, and since the discovery has
become known efforts are being made
to obtain a flowing well.
Why is it that the municipality of
Phoenix must pay $75 per month for
men to drive its sprinkling carts, when
private citizens can get just as compe
tent labor for $40? Do the men em
ployed by the city labor harder?
Do they put in more hours? Why is it,
anyway?
One of the great drawbacks to de
velopment in this territory is the
scarcity and high price of fuel. The
discovery of oil would change all this
and grease the wheels of industry. Our
prayers are with the bold pioneers who
are boring into the earth near Tempe.
Good luck to you, and rich returns.
How long will it be before this valley
is producing its own fuel? Crude oil
would make an excellent substitute
for mesquite wood, and would be much
cheaper.
The Salt River valley never looked
prettier and was never more prosperous
than today.
There are 980 producing oil wells in
and around the city of Los Angeles.
The population of France is 33,203,000,
of whom just one-third live in towns
of over 6,000 inhabitants.

AN OLEAGINOUS PROSPECT.
There is oil near Tucson. It is at the
base of the Rincon and Santa Rita
mountains. In less than thirty days it
is liable to be spouting out of the
ground. Then we will have another
source of wealth, which will be equal
to so much cash thrown into our busi
ness channels. Tucson Star.

A RESTRICTED HABITAT.
Phoenix has it in for Prescott again.
The saloon singer must tune up in some
other municipal locality other than the
capital city. Prescott is the only song
bird town left in Arizona, so look out
for the fascinating chirpers in large
flocks. Journal-Miner.

HOW WILL CHINA PAY?
One seems to detect a sort of shame-
faced air in the very terms in which the
ministers at Pekin have last formu
lated their demand for an indemnity.
After fixing the total at the enormous
figure of $337,000,000 they innocently
ask China how she expects to be able
to pay it. The first idea of arranglng
a sort of guarantee for the indemnity
among the powers themselves seems
now to be abandoned. China must find
the money. If she says she can do it,
what more natural result could she
look for than that the foreign troops
should conclude to quarter themselves
longer upon their unwilling hosts, and
enlarge their bill for entertainment ac
cordingly? If China vows that she
cannot pay so large a sum, then the
powers will begin to eye with envy
her securities in the way of real estate
and movables. It is cheerfully sug
gested that the indemnity of 450,000,000
taels can be raised by increasing cus
toms taxes. But the entire revenue
from customs taxation in the last year
of good trade, 1899, was only 27,000,000
taels. To increase that almost twenty-
fold would mean a frightful derange
ment of business. Evidently the diplo
mats are going to make sure that they
shall never pay off alone, nor be aston
ished at their own moderation. As for our own government, after
having urged $200,000,000 as the maxi
mum indemnity, we do not see how it
can join in any coercive measures to
extort from China nearly twice that
sum. N. Y. Post.

PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF.
A new use has been found for the
moving picture. In a recent football
match in England the game was decid
ed by a single goal, and it was claimed
that this was not properly made. A
great deal of testimony was taken on
both sides, and it promised to be one
of those questions that could never be
satisfactorily decided. Now a new wit
ness, and an impartial one, is to be
brought into the case. A motion pic
ture machine was on the field getting
views to be used at an exhibition. It
is claimed that the machine was in op
eration during the time the disputed
goal was scored, and it is proposed to
have a committee examine the films
and report on the story that they tell.
It is easy to imagine that the dispute
may be settled in this manner. It may
be remembered that a set of pictures
taken at the start of the second race
for the America's Cup, between the De
fender and the Valkyrie III., was used
by the committee in deciding the right
and wrong of that famous foul. If
the English pictures do solve that ques
tion of goal or no goal, it will be highly
satisfactory to at least one of the teams
and will also be a splendid advertise
ment for the pictures, which will be
shown at the Crystal Palace. - Boston

SENATOR FRYE'S ASSORTED
AFFLICTION.
On top of the purchase of the Ley
land Steamship line comes the official
announcement this morning of the
formation of a shipyard trust. Yet
Senator Frye was reported only last
week as being busily engaged in "re-
modeling" the ship bill. Poor man, he
will have a hard time of it. No sooner
does he get his bill modeled so as to
prevent a monopoly on the water from
taking advantage of it, than a mono
poly on land suddenly appears to
fright him. If both those who go down
to the sea in ships and those who build
them are to make a great display of
wealth and prosperity, and, above all,
organize themselves into trusts, how
can the beggars' appeal be again made
to the national treasury? Senator Frye's plight as
"remodeler" is really pitiful. He knows
what the postmenant by
"Affliction assorted, anguish of all sizes."
