THE BRYAN" GROUP.
Steady Development of Mines in the
Riverside District
I visited the W.J. Bryan group of
mines, last week, says a correspondent
of the Florence Tribune, owned by
Mrs. Alfred Kinney of Globe. It is
since I last visited the property that
there has been quite a lot of develop
ment work done; one shaft, which is
100 feet deep and is called the Bryan
No. 1, is timbered in first class style
equal to anything in the territory.
There is a vein of ore which is five
feet wide and averages from 14 to 25
per cent copper showing up. The
mines at the present time are in good
working condition, ready for stoping
out ore. On the adjoining claim,
known as Bryan No. 2, there is a shaft
100 feet deep which is also timbered
in first class style and shows a mag
nificent body of sulphide ore; the vein
is full width of shaft and averages
over 10 per cent copper. There has
been no crosscutting done on this vein
and don’t know the width of the ore
body; there has also been quite a lot
of work done on Bryan No. 3. This
year there has been a 100-foot drift run
showing up a magnificent ore body on
the claim. There are nine claims be
longing to this group; there is ore
enough on the ground to run forty-
ton jacket twelve months, without
drawing upon what there is in
sight, and at the ore
right from No. 2 shaft one. I make
a rough calculation of what will be
produced from the 100-foot shaft with
a drift of 200 feet long and five feet
wide and the value of product aver-
aging ore at 8 per cent and copper bul
lion at 10 cents per pound, 100 feet
deep, 200 feet long and five feet wide,
will give an ore body of 100,000 cubic
feet, allowing thirteen cubic feet to a
ton, would be 7,692 tons of ore, which
at 8 per cent will produce 617 tons of
copper bullion, which at 10 cents per
pound will amount in value to $123,000,
not considering gold, silver, sulphuric
acid and other valuables which may be
in the ores.

Mrs. Kinney values her property at
$100,000, and I consider it none too
high an estimate.

Mrs. Kinney deserves great credit
for the pluck and enterprise shown in
taking hold of this property from the
beginning and carrying it through un
til now she has a well developed mine,
ready for some enterprising company
to take hold of and carry out the work
of producing and making Riverside
camp, as it ought to be, one of the best
camps in the territory.
A GOOD MINE.
A Promising Copper Property Coming
to the Front.
It is one of the Great
Western mines in the Dragoons, says
the Tombstone Prospector. Colonel
Young is associated in the bond on
this promising copper property and is
most pleased with the developments.
Regular carload shipments of ore to
the smelters at El Paso are made and
the ore shipping record of the Great
Western already won for it credit
in satisfaction and renown. Though
not extensively handled in the prospect
stage the property is rapidly develop
ing into a producer of no mean worth.
In the prosecution of work the experience
of modern mining methods are
being put into practical operation on
the property and a systematic and en
ergetic activity is being carried on.

A large new hoist and a twelve horse
power gasoline hoisting engine will be
erected shortly, the engine now being
en route from Chicago. Other improve
ments of a substantial nature are con
templated by the company and will re
ceive attention as fast as conditions
warrant. The company proposes to
sink a shaft 500 feet and thoroughly
prospect the property. Rich ores
will solve themselves. The ores of the
company carry high copper percentages,
are associated with lime formation and the
mineral being self fluxing is very de
sirable ore for the smelter.

The mine is most favorably
located in the rich copper belt of
the Dragoons; its development is
proving a meritorious property and
has a most auspicious future.
SMELTER TO OPERATE.
Arizona Copper Smelting Company
Preparing to Start Operations.
The smelter of the Arizona Copper
Smelting company will be in full blast
in a few days. Five cars of coke are
here and ore is now being hauled to the
ore houses from the mines. Hauling
commenced last Monday, and forty men
are now at work taking ore out at
those mines.

Mr. Charles Qualey is now busily
engaged in getting everything ready
for the starting and successful opera
tion of the smelter.

Frank Qualey is increasing his force
of men at the mines and pushing all
the work vigorously, and while the in
tention is to buy and treat custom ores,
yet they expect to take sufficient ores
from their own mines to operate the
smelter, and its capacity will be increased when
necessary.

An agreement has been entered in
to with L. L. Qualey to treat the ores
taken from his Lone Star group of
mines. He will put a force of men at
work and take out ore and do extensive
development work at the same
time.

The successful operation of this
smelter, which is an assured fact,
means wonderful development of the
mining industry of this country. It

the opening of
one of the best camps in Arizona in
the Lone Star mining district, eight
miles north of Safford.—Safford Guardian.
MINING NOTES.
J. D. Moore has his
exhibit arrayed
in the plaza and
at room 150 west side
a very creditable exhibit.
It is getting
to be, says the Prescott
Courier. He
keeps his more valuable
specimens un
der lock and key.
In the latter col
lection are a number
of very hand
some free gold showing pieces of
quartz. Several pans filled with con
centrates were noticed
with the ex
hibit. On the 10th of this month Mr.
Moore will leave Prescott for points
south of Prescott and collect ores from
Big Bug, Chaparral and
the Bradshaws
which are sent to the
railroad.
The report of the sale of the Daly
group of mines, lying just east of the
Copper Queen company properties, by
the owner, Martin Oeillorlo, was re
cently referred to in the Orb. As such
a sale would be an important one and
the consideration doubtless reaching
into the hundreds of thou
sands of dol
lars, the item obtained
considerable
notice, we are now
able to state
from direct information that while the
sale has not yet been concluded the
negotiations have so far progressed
that but little doubt is entertained of
the sale being actually
made within a
very short time. As to the terms of
the sale, or the names of the prospect
ive purchasers Mr. Oeillorlo is as yet
reticent.—Bisbee Orb.
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Durham came to
their home at
the Cottaswoods. They
report active
mining operations in the neighbor
hood, and Mr. Durham has been for
tunate enough to find an abundant sup
ply of water at his mine at a depth of
thirty feet.—Florence Tribune.
Colonel William Herrington of Tucson
and Lieutenant Wiley Jones, district
attorney of Graham county, were in
Florence Tuesday arguing
a certiorari
proceeding before Judge
Davis in cham
bers. It related to the taxation of the
Detroit Copper company’s property at
Clifton.
Mr. Alexander Hill, general man
ager cf the Ray mines, limited, arrived
Thursday direct from London, says the
Florence Tribune, and it is understood
he returns with abundant
capital and
authority to prosecute work on the
great copper property in his charge.
This will undoubtedly include reduc
tion works, a railroad to the Southern
Pacific and such other labor-saving
improvements as a successful opera
tion of the mines may demand. His
immense capital behind, and. There
is immense capital behind this com
pany and in the hands of Mr. Hill it
will be economically and honestly ex
pended.
Early last week a mining man on
Troom creek concluded to develop a
sufficient supply of water near his cab
in, and accordingly let a contract to
sink a well
sixty feet deep. The other day the
work was completed and the owner
thought he would go below and size
up the work and measure the water.
He accepted the work, and
noticing a
vein of quartz crosscutting the well
concluded to take a sample and assay
it. He was simply dumfounded to
pick up a button of gold that gave a
valuation of $238 per ton in free gold
and says now that he will do a little
drifting and go without water. The
vein is a strong one, he says, and with
development may run into a bonanza.
—Journal-Miner.
Attention is called today to the ad
of bids wanted by W. E. Defty to per
form custom work on his mine near
Wickenburg, says the Journal-Miner.
Maricopa Copper Mines company ad
vertises in this issue, says the
Journal-Miner, for bids for sinking and
timbering a mining shaft in the De
born district.
An occasional prospector, when he
makes a strike, tries to
keep it quiet
for a time, but that is poor business, but
does not see
it. If you publish your strike and it
is a good one there is no danger of your claims being
jumped, and you are not
competing to get a
better price for it.
It pays to own a copper mine now
adays, says the San Francisco Chron
icle. Many of the mining companies
are showing dividends of 10 per cent
and all of them are prosperous. Owing
to the new uses of the metal in the
arts, more particularly those in which
electricity figures, the demand for cop
per is far in excess of the supply and
the price is advancing. Copper that
sold for 11 cents in August, 1898,
now sells at 18 cents per pound. A re
cent review of the market in the New
York Sun states that Calumet and
Hecla dividends for the first six
months this year amounts to $60
per share, or $6,000,000 in all, and if
the market holds at 18 cents there
will be earnings on an estimated out
put for 1899 of 100,000,000 pounds of
copper for $120 per share. Such fig
ures sufficiently explain the craze among miners
for the discovery of the raw material
for copper manufacture.
Ex-Supervisor Charles F.
Schumacher is out today on the copper
and gold claims in Canyon del Oro, in which he
is interested. The ores show assays in
gold, 20 to 26 per cent copper, 200
ounces silver and 30 per cent lead.—

FOREIGN NOTES

AND COMMENT
It is odd that no one as yet should
have called attention to the odd man
ner in which the most religious of Eu
ropean monarchs give their sanction,
so to speak, to the harem system.
Thus Queen Victoria is most particular
that due consideration and regard
should be accorded by the members of
her government and of her court to the
seraglio arrangements of the petty rul
ers and dignitaries of her Indian em
pire and of the Indian members of her
household. While she would frown on
any attempt on the part of her officials
or courtiers belonging to the white
race if they were to indulge in a plu
rality of wives and in an establishment
of odalisques, she appears to consider
it perfectly legitimate in the case of
her more dusky lieges.
It should thoroughly be understood
that it is a question of hue and com
plexion, rather than of creed, that de
termines her attitude toward polyg
amy, for when the other day one of the
principal English-born officials of the
colony of Ceylon became a convert to
the faith of Mohammed, and proceeded to
add to the number of his wives, she
insisted upon his immediate dismissal
from the service of the crown without
any claim to the pension to which he
was really entitled by his twenty years
of duty in a tropical climate.
It is the same thing with the em
press of Germany and with the czar.
When Augusta Victoria, who is the
most religious and Puritan minded of
women, stayed at Constantinople, she
thought it quite natural to pay visits
to the various wives of the sultan and
to attend entertainments given in her
honor in his seraglio, while within the
last few weeks the czar has presented
to the emir, or ruler of Bokhara, a
state railroad train, consisting of four
cars furnished in luxurious style. Two
of these cars are arranged by orders of
his majesty for the accommodation of
the emir’s harem, with windows close
ly barred and curtained. The gauge of
the Russian line east of the Caucasus
is narrower than that in use on the
railroads in the European portion of
the empire. The czar has caused the
train to be so constructed that it can
only be used on the narrow gauge, with
the object presumably of preventing
the emir from making use of the gift
to pay inopportune visits to St. Pet
ersburg.

With the death of the old Marquis
of Casteja at Paris there vanishes the
last of those French nobles who served
as pages of honor to the kings of
France and who received their educa
tion as such. The marquis, like his
fellow pages, was brought up at the
expense of King Louis XVIII, the lads
having a special riding school assign
ed to them at the palace of Versailles,
where they were likewise taught to
fence. Their uniform was of royal
blue, with gold buttons, and among
their duties was to attend the sov
ereign whenever he went out driving, as
well as at all state functions.
It was no joke, however, being
page to Louis XVIII, who was so enor
mously fat that it was absolutely im
possible for him to walk. The vorac
ity of his appetite, however, and his
gluttony rendered it indispensable that
he should take exercise for the purpose
of aiding his digestion. With this ob
ject in view a carriage was especially
constructed for him which was only
hung in front, but which had no
springs or straps behind, so that the
jolting, especially over the cobble
stones with which Paris and Versailles
were paved in those days, was some
thing terrific. While this jolting was
very beneficial to the monarch’s
health, it was a source of terrible dis
comfort to those of the pages of honor,
whose duty it was to stand behind the
royal carriage or on the doorstep at
either side.

Pages of honor, I need scarcely add,
are in no sense of the word menials.
They are a regular institution, and
a very picturesque feature at the vari
ous royal and imperial courts of Eu
rope, and are invariably lads of noble
birth. In England their salary amounts
to about $1,500 a year, and on state
occasions they wear gorgeous uni
forms of blue and silver, which are
doubtless familiar to those of readers
of these letters who have had oppor
tunity of attending either drawing
rooms or state balls at Buckingham
palace. The duties of the boys are
very light, as they have nothing to do
but to take part in a certain number of
state functions, the queen dispensing
with their attendance save on grand
occasions.

At the courts of Berlin and of Vi
enna they are chosen from among the
best looking of the corps of cadets, all
of them of noble birth. At St. Peters
burg they are selected from the so
called College of Pages. The latter is
an institution maintained entirely at
the expense of the czar, where the
sons of government officials and court
dignitaries are educated. A lad can
only get admission thereto on the per
sonal nomination of the czar, and all
the pupils of the institution are titular
pages of honor until the moment that
they graduate from the school into the
army.

Emperor William is just at the pres
ent somewhat embarrassed by the pres
ence in Berlin of an elderly female of
the Mohammedan persuasion who has
announced her determination of re
maining a fixture in the Prussian cap
ital until she has had an opportunity
of casting herself at his feet. She is
the Sultana Sida, widow of the late
ruler of Zanzibar. It may be remem
bered that when the latter died, his
nephew Said seized possession of the
throne in defiance of the laws of suc
cession of the sultanate and contrary
to the wishes of the suzerain power,
namely, Great Britain. The English
made short work of his pretensions.
They bombarded the palace in which
he had established himself, and drove
him to seek refuge at the German con
sulate, where he made his way to the
German portion of the African main
land, where he is now living. The
sultana sided with her nephew, went
into exile with him, and is now in Ber
lin for the purpose of imploring Em
peror William to restore Said to the
throne.
She has had all kinds of adventures
since she arrived in Berlin, being eject
ed from numerous hotels and boarding
houses, the proprietors of which were
