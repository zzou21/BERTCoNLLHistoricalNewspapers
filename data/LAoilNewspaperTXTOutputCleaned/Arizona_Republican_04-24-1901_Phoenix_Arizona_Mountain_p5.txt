...Two Prices

for two pairs of shoes. Is
what we get, but when you buy a W. & K. shoe you get a shoe that stands
the hardest kind of wear with the
greatest degree of comfort, and has the
largest amount of style at the smallest
possible price.

Choose Your Druggist Carefully
A druggist can do more
harm or good than most people
give him credit for.
There are different qualities in
drugs, Just as there are in dry
goods, and to the outsider all
qualities go by the same name.
The difference between pure,
high grade drugs, and cheap,
inferior drugs of the same name
means the difference between
getting sick and keeping well.
When a doctor writes a pre
scription he means best quality.
When some druggists fill a pre
scription they think only of their
profits.
Choose your druggist carefully.

READ AND REFLECT
Soon warm weather will be here, and
with that wood cook stoves your kitchen
will be doubly hot. Your kitchen may
be kept as cool as your parlor if you
follow our directions.
First read this "Ad." through three
times and then show it to Pa, that he
may read it, and persuade him to
come with you to our store and see our
line of Wickless Blue Flame Oil Stoves,
Buy one, take it home, and use it to
cook, iron, bake, brew and stew on until
next November. We have three different
makes of Wickless Blue Flame Oil
Stoves, ranging in price from $5.00 to
$35.50. But the Standard Lighting Co.
is the best one and costs more than the
other makes. More of them in use than
all other makes made. It is simpler,
more durable, safer, more economical
than any other stove on the market; it
works, a child can run it; it costs half
what it costs to run a wood stove; cool,
clean and convenient.
2-burner Standard Wickless Blue
Flame Oil Stoves, $12.00
3-burner Standard Wickless Blue
Flame Oil Stoves, $10.00.
2-burner Cabinet Standard Wickless
Blue Flame Oil Stoves, $15.00.
3-burner Cabinet Standard Wickless
Blue Flame Oil Stoves, $20.00.
5-burner Cabinet Standard Step Oven
Wickless Blue Flame Oil Stoves,
$21.50.
4-burner Cabinet Step Oven Standard
Wickless Blue Flame Oil Stoves,
$29.50.
6-burner Step Oven Standard Wickless
Blue Flame Oil Stoves, $33.60.
Other makes, not Standard, cheaper.
We have sold nearly 200 Standard
stoves in the territory in the past four
years. Other stoves come and go, are
bought and returned, closed out at
cost or shifted from one agent to an
other, but the Standard has been sold
from one store in Phoenix for the past
four years.

BUCKING BURRO. A small boy
with a bucking burro gave a free show
on the Fleming block corner yesterday
afternoon.
WICKENBURG TOWN SITE. Y.
Garcia yesterday placed on file in the
office of the county recorder a map of
the town site of Wickenburg.
MINING LOCATION. W. F., F. Z.
H. H. and W. H. Linville filed a notice
of the location of the Golden Wonder
mine in the Cave Creek district.
REFITTING STOREROOM. The
storeroom on Washington street formerly
occupied by the postoffice is being refit
ted and the brick vault in the center of the room has been removed.
RETURNS TO CHICAGO. Mr. Robert
Kane, for several years manager of
the cafe at the Hotel Adams, will leave
about May 15, with Mrs. Kane, for their
old home in Chicago. They will visit
there for a couple of months and will
spend considerable time in Canada and
Michigan, returning here late in the
autumn.
SUNDAY SCHOOL PICNIC. The
Presbyterian Sunday school has ar
ranged an annual picnic to take place
in a grove near Wickenburg next Sat
urday. It is expected that 200 or 250
persons will be on the picnic. A spe
cial train will be run and the rate will
be made very low for the occasion.
A TEN PER CENT PAYMENT. A.
F. Meisinger, assignee of the business
of H. W. Ryder, announces that he is
now making another ten per cent pay
ment to the creditors, which makes a
total of ninety per cent paid. He says
further that the business is in excellent
shape and that all creditors will receive
payment in full in a short time.
RAILROAD MAN IN TOWN. Col.
Epe Randolph, superintendent of the
Southern Pacific for the division of Ari
zona and New Mexico, arrived in the
city yesterday morning, and after look
ing over the business affairs of the
road at this end of the line returned
in his private car to Tucson last night.
He was accompanied on his return by
Frank Cox, attorney for the road's in
terests in Arizona and New Mexico.
WILL NOT STOP HERE. Word
has been received that Norman Orme,
for a number of years a resident of
Phoenix, and well known here, but
who has been residing at Honolulu for
the last two years, will not stop off
at Phoenix, on a trip he is making
from San Francisco to New York, to
visit relatives and friends. He is now
en route to New York with a party of
friends, and will likely make that
place his home hereafter. He intends
entering the employ of a Wall street
broker.
TO TAKE A LONG TRIP. Mr. P. A.
Thoraldson is planning an extensive
tour with a vengeance. Early in July
he will leave here for New York city.
He will likely visit Washington and
other large cities on the Atlantic coast
and then come back across the continent
by way of Chicago to the state of Wash
ington. He will visit at his old home
in that state, where his wife is now.
He will return to Phoenix late in the
summer, coming by way of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles, stopping a short
time at each place.
MARRIED. Mr. Emil Richard Win
ters, who came here from Los Angeles
about six months ago, and Miss Kath
erine June Andrews of this city, were
married yesterday afternoon by Rev.
C. V. Cowan. The groom is 21 years
of age, and the bride about 18. They
will receive the congratulations of
many friends.
A FRIGHTENED TEAM. A two
horse team standing in front of the
Phoenix bakery was frightened yester
day afternoon at a passing car and one
of the lines got caught in the neck
yoke. The team turned in toward the
sidewalk, but was quickly caught by
the men standing round, though it
looked for a minute as though the two
gentlemen and the two ladies in the
vehicle were about to experience an ex
citing time.
BUSY MEN. Mr. J. S. Patterson,
manager of the Galena Oil company of
Franklin, Pa., with headquarters at
Cincinnati, spent two or three days here
the latter part of last week, spent Mon
day in Prescott and returned here yes
terday morning, leaving last night for
Los Angeles. He was accompanied by
Mr. W. E. Amann, an oil expert in the
employ of the company, which does an
immense business in the supplying of
railroads with the various kinds of oil
used in railroad work. The company
has annual contracts with many of the
leading railroads.
ALL WORKING TOGETHER. Dur
ing the past few days, a number of
telegrams have passed between Gov
ernor Murphy and Mr. Cortelyou, sec
retary to President McKinley. They
have all been on the subject of the
program for the entertainment of
the presidential party here and the
general result of all of them is, that
the program as heretofore an
nounced, meets with the approval of
Mr. McKinley and his secretary. The
trip to Congress Mine will be made
without doubt and the party will be
in Phoenix in ample time to carry out
the details now contemplated. There
seems to be no friction at any point,
and the day will undoubtedly be a
most memorable one for Phoenix.
CONDEMNED. Francisco S. Garcia,
who was sentenced to death and whose
execution was to have taken place at
Prescott on the 30th, will be allowed to
die a natural death, or at least as natu
ral as one can die in the penitentiary.
Governor Murphy has commuted his
sentence to life imprisonment.
The murderer and his victim, Encarna
cion Sepeda, were wood haulers, both
were intoxicated, and the killing took
place in the vicinity of Weaver. A
very strong idea for mercy was urged
by the district attorney, the jury and
citizens of Yavapai county, and there
was considerable ambiguity in the tes
timony submitted at the trial of the
case.
WEDDING AND INQUEST. Manuel
Acosta, who got a divorce on Saturday,
and Jesus Maria Rodriguez were married
on Monday at the residence of the groom
on Jackson street between Second and
Third streets. Yesterday morning it was
reported to Justice Burnett that the
groom, Rodriguez, was dead, and as he
had never called a physician during his
illness, it was necessary to hold an in
quest before a burial permit would be
issued. The Justice summoned a jury
and sent for Dr. Hughes, who examined
the remains, and testified that in his
opinion death resulted from natural
causes. The jury submitted a verdict
in accordance with the testimony. The
man was known to have been sick for
a long time.
JUSTICE GRAY'S COURT. In Jus
tice Gray's court yesterday Emencudo
Orosco, charged with having stolen a
gun belonging to E. H. Powell from
a gun store here over two years ago,
was tried and discharged, the evidence
not being sufficient to convict. The
case of Justice J. M. Burnett vs. Maricopa
county was tried and argued for the
plaintiff by the plaintiff, Mr. Burnett,
and argued for the defense by Judge
Kibley. A judgment was given in
favor of the plaintiff and an appeal was
taken to the district court, where it will
probably be tried on Saturday. The
case is one in relation to fees of jus
tices of the peace of which extended
reference was made in yesterday's
issue.
VALLEY GRAIN. H. V. Gerdes,
living one and a half miles north of
Glendale, has brought to the office of
the secretary of the board of trade, a
remarkably fine specimen of oats,
which was raised on an alfalfa field of
his ranch. The distance from the base
of the stalk to the tip of the longest
tassel is over six feet and a half. The
body of the grain is in double and treble
heads, very firm and compact. Had
there been a sufficient quantity raised
it would doubtless have yielded a large
number of bushels to the acre. The
stock bearing the grain is very strong
and thick for an oat stock.
WORK AT CONGRESS. Jack Davenport
left last night for Congress, where he
will be engaged in construction work
on the new mill. Two men were sent
up the day before for employment on
the same work.
IMPROVED CAR LINE. The street
car system of Phoenix now represents
a trackage of more than ten miles. Four
years ago the trackage did not exceed
three miles. The latest extension com
pleted is a line from the Washington
street line at Seventh street to the
Maricopa & Phoenix depot. Cars on
that line run in the morning and even
ing, principally to make connections
with the train, suspending operations
between 10 o'clock in the morning and
2 o'clock in the afternoon. The general
power plant, which until two years ago
found much difficulty in supplying
power constantly to two or three cars
running on the Washington street line
and one on what is known as the north
division, after several improvements,
now furnishes without cessation power
enough to operate three or four cars on
the Washington street line, one to the
Indian school on a new line, one on the
northern division and a car running to
the depot. On extraordinary occasion
others are pressed into service, and
with large crowds aboard the cars have
successfully taxed the generating plant
without a break-down. Work is in full
blast on the Seventh avenue extension
of the city railway line from Washing
ton street to Van Buren street.
THINGS OF BEAUTY. At a time
when the Ohio river is raging on a
series of floods and snows over the mid
dle western states and where ice
abounds on the streets of Philadelphia,
Phoenix and its parks present an ap
pearance of verdure and bloom brought
out by an early and delightful spring.
The grounds at the capitol building,
which G. H. Smith, the gardener, has
labored for several years to beautify,
present a magnificent appearance.
Without extra embellishment they will
be so inviting as to delight the presi
dential party which will view them on
May 7 and impress upon the president
in a much decided manner than could
volumes of language and descriptive
reading matter the magic power of
water in causing a desert to bloom. Ac
cording to the plans of the reception
committee, no especial effort will be put
forth to beautify the grounds. They
will be clean (but they usually are) and
the new improvements and plants will
be carefully watched, but there will be
no artificial decorations. It is alto
gether likely that new artifices would
detract rather than add to the beautiful
appearance brought out by nature.
I will put on sale for one week a line

Every great fortune had its first
foundation laid in small savings. Mar
shall Field began work as a clerk in a
small retail dry goods store. Today he
is one of the greatest merchants in
America. He saved something every
day. Then he put his savings in a sav
ings bank, where they drew interest.

ings Bank?
