WEALTH OF PHOENIX  
IN STREET TREES  

That Feature of the City to Be Given  
Advertisement  

One excellent feature of Phoenix  
which never has been given much  
publicity is about to receive adver-  
tisement at the arboricultural conven-  
tion which will meet at Pasadena  
tomorrow for a session of two days.  
This will be the seventh annual con-  
vention. Phoenix will be represented  
there by L. S. Blackman, city forest-  
er, who left last night for the coast.  
Mr. Blackman, who has been giv-  
ing the trees of Phoenix expert care  
for the last three years took with  
him large photographs of the tree-  
lined streets of Phoenix. It will make  
an excellent exhibit and will give a  
much different impression of the city  
than is generally entertained by out-  
siders. People coming here for the first  
time express amazement at the num-  
ber and beauty of the trees every-  

ERUPTION ON FACE  
ITCHED AND SMARTED  

Spread to Neck and Back. Had to  
Leave School. Pimples Red and  
Raw. Cuticura Soap and Oint-  
ment Cured in Six Months.  

7009 Madison Ave., Chicago, Ill.  
“When I was a young girl of fifteen I had  
an eruption come on my face which spread  
to my neck and all over my  
back. My flesh would get  
sore in spots and a lump as  
large as a pea would be under  
the skin. Then it would come  
to the outer skin. It irritated  
me very much and caused so  
much suffering that I was so  
nervous and sick I had to  
leave school. The pimples  
were red and raw if I scratched them sore  
and left a brown spot on my skin. My skin  
would burn sometimes and itched and  
smarted and my clothes irritated me and  
kept the spots raw.  
“I had treatment which did not help me.  
I had been troubled in this way for three  
years before I used Cuticura Soap and  
Ointment. I used the Cuticura Soap to  
cleanse the skin, then the Cuticura Oint-  
ment morning and evening. I was relieved  
of the burning and soreness after the first  
two weeks and was well after six months’  
treatment.” (Signed) Mrs. D. Skinner.  
Sept. 25, 1912.  

For treating poor complexions, red, rough  
hands, and dry, thin and falling hair, Cuti-  
cura Soap and Cuticura Ointment have been  
the world's favorites for more than a gen-  
eration. A single set is often sufficient. Sold  
everywhere. Liberal sample of each mailed  
free, with 32-p. Skin Book. Address post-  
card “Cuticura, Dept. T, Boston.”  

Men who shave and shampoo with Cu-  
ticura Soap will find it best for skin and scalp.  

where outside the business district.  
The journey through the desert does  
not prepare them for such arboreal  
wealth. They naturally expect a  
dearth of shade. Even residents of  
the city do not realize how rich  
Phoenix is in this respect. They  
would learn something from the pho-  
tographs which Mr. Blackman has  
taken.  
They should learn that there are  
19,124 trees along the streets of Phoe-  
nix within the city limits, all of  
which have received the attention of  
the city forester. A large majority  
of the trees are ash, which Mr. Black-  
man believes to be the best for this  
climate. Next in number are the  
umbrellas. There are about 4,000  
palms, palm and Phoenix Canariensis.  
There are four commercial palms.  
The president of the arboricultural  
convention is J. H. Reed, the man  
who suggested the idea of the con-  
vention, one of the foremost foresters  
of the coast and a warm friend of  
Mr. Davy, who is known throughout  
the world as the tree surgeon.

CITY JAILER ENTANGLED  
IN WHEEL COLLISION  

Popular Officer and Neighbor Meet Un-  
expectedly on Madison Street  
With Dire Result.  

City Jailer John Perrin had an acci-  
dent last night on Madison street  
about six o’clock that might have re-  
sulted seriously. Perrin was riding  
along Madison street when a neighbor  
named Tom Jones, who was hurrying  
to catch a train and was also mounted  
on a wheel, collided with him and as  
a result Perrin received some very se-  
vere contusions.  
The wheels of both parties were  
broken, Perrin’s wheel having a  
smashed front wheel and Jones’ bicycle  
sustained a broken rear wheel, both  
men received bruises and lost consider-  
able skin as they slid for several yards  
after the impact.  
It is just about a year ago that Per-  
rin was in another collision and he did  
not escape so fortunately as he did this  
time. The blame for yesterday’s acci-  
dent cannot be attached to any one of  
the riders as they did not see each  
other until they were too close to avoid  
the crash.  
It was not known in the excitement  
that followed the accident whether  
Jones caught the train or not, but as  
he was not seen in his usual haunts it  
is thought that he succeeded.

HALF-TIME SCHOOLS  
WORCESTER, Mass., Sept. 3.  
With the re-opening of the public  
schools this week an innovation was  
introduced in the form of half-time  
schools of grammar and high school  
grades. These schools are intended  
for the benefit of boys and girls  
more than fourteen years of age who  
want to obtain an education and, at  
the same time continue their earn-  
ings of money as a support of them-  
selves and their families. The plan  
provides that the boys and the girls  
employed in factories that wish to  
co-operate in the plan work in pairs.  
The work in these factories will be  
so laid out that when one boy is in  
school for a week, the other boy of  
the pair will do his work in the shop.  
The same plan will be carried out in  
factories where girls are employed.  

George H. Puntenney of this city,  
who was called to Needles, California  
last Friday on account of the sudden  
death of his brother Eli Puntenney, will  
arrive this morning on the Santa Fe  
train with the remains. They will be  
taken in charge of Easterling and  
Whitney and the funeral arrangements  
will be announced later.  
Eli Puntenney, the deceased, was an  
Arizona pioneer, having come to this  
state nearly fifty years ago. He left  
Arizona to engage in business at  
Needles only a few years ago. During  
his long residence here he made many  
friends, as he was a man of many ster-  
ling qualities.  
As soon as the information of the  
death reached here of the death of the  
pioneer, his brother and his daughter  
Mrs. F. N. Henderson of Five Points,  
hurried to Needles to bring the body  
back to Phoenix for interment.

mond Satterwaite, formerly of Phoe-  
nix, but now of Los Angeles, where  
he is special agent of the interior de-  
partment, is in the city in connection  
with business of the United  
States land office here.  

FORESTRY OFFICIALS John R.  
Kerr of Albuquerque, one of the trav-  
eling advisors of the forestry service,

querque, and R. H. Hinderer, forest  
supervisor of the Prescott national  
forest, are in the city for a couple of  
days on business.  

VELIE TRUCK COMING  
OVER THE RACE ROUTE  

Drivers of Car to be Turned Over to  
Union Oil Co., to Follow  
Race Route.  

(Special Correspondence.)  
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 30. From this  
city to Phoenix, Arizona, is a long trek  
that was begun yesterday by the crew  
of a Velie truck, which is to be deliv-  
ered by the Renton Motor Car com-  
pany to the Union Oil people there.  
Camping by the side of their pon-  
derous mount, L. J. Tuttle and Gro-  
ver C. Provin, who are piloting the  
truck and traveling in the cool hours  
of the morning and evening, both ex-  
pect to reach Phoenix within ten days.  
The first stop was planned for Capis-  
trano, and from there the three-ton  
vehicle will continue into San Diego,  
carrying the large tank which consti-  
tuted the load.  
From San Diego the difficult part  
of the remaining 400 miles of the jour-  
ney will be commenced. Part of the  
route will lie through desert sand and  
sage, where miles of sand will be en-  
countered. The truck was supplied with  
225 gallons of water and 225 gallons of  
gasoline, to be used only in case of  
emergency.  
It is planned by the drivers to fol-  
low the same route as will be taken  
by the Los Angeles-to-Phoenix racers  
on November 3, passing through El  
Centro. When the truck left The  
Tribune office for the journey, both  
drivers were as unconcerned as though  
they were leaving for a ten-mile jaunt  
over city boulevards and not for a  
hazardous ride in a clumsy vehicle over  
steep grades and through the waste  
places.  
The car, decorated for the occasion,  
is one of several sold by the Renton  
Motor Car company to the Union Oil  
concern. In the Southern California  
transactions the Velies were repre-  
sented by Thomas F. Dunn.

FINANCES AND  
MARKETS  

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH  
NEW YORK, Sept. 3. Sentiment  
was bearish in the stock market to-  
day and the downward movement of  
the preceding session was carried  
measurably further. There was little  
to counteract the array of unfavor-  
able factors which operated against  
the market yesterday. Several rail-  
roads, including the Rock Island and  
the St. Paul, reported shrinkages of  
net earnings for July. Another weak-  
ening feature was the continued loss  
of cash by the banks. Railroad  
stocks were the heaviest as a class,  
although Amalgamated, Steel and a  
few other industrials showed weak-  
ness. The loss among the usual leaders  
extended to more than two points in  
some cases. Toward the close there  
was a slight rally.  
An announcement by underwriters  
that eighty per cent of Union Pacif-  
ic’s holdings of Southern Pacific was  
subscribed for, assuring the success  
of the undertaking, may have played  
a part in bringing about the late  
rally. The result fell short of recent,  
optimistic predictions that virtually  
the whole amount would be taken.  
Southern Pacific declined frac-  
tionally after the announcement to  
83½, the year’s low record. It was  
held generally however that the mar-  
ket’s ability to absorb eighty per cent  
of the offering of $88,000,000 was an  
indication of improved investment  
conditions.  
The bond market developed consid-  
erable irregularity with a downward  
tendency. Total sales, par value,  
$1,475,000. Government unchanged.
