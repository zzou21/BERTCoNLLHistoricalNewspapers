TEMPE STARTS ITS
CAMPAIGN
MESA HOTEL PROJECT

TEMPE, Ariz., June 8.—O. S. Taylor,
head of the health department of the
city, is now requesting all citizens of
the town to provide tight covers for
their garbage cans in order that the
large quantity of flies and other filth
and germ carrying insects may be les
sened. Every citizen should consider it
his duty to see to this and do so at
once as this is a long and greatly
needed act.

Three Families Move

Mr. and Mrs. Bliss Sanders have
moved from the Kingsbury Flats into
the Schweppe bungalow. Mr. and Mrs.
Chas. Mosier will move from their
apartment in the same building to the
one just vacated by the Sanders. Mr.
W. M. Bishop and family will move
from their country home to the apart

NOT TO BE LAUNCHED
TILL FALL

During his one and one half years
ministry here, Mr. Reid has endeared
himself greatly to the church and to
the public generally, being recognized
as a good man, free from affectation,
and genuine in his sympathies.

Mesa vs. Phoenix Cubs Today.

The Mesa ball team will go up
against one of the crack teams of the
state today when on the local grounds,
at 3:30 o’clock will be staged a battle
royal between the two near-champion
teams, Mesa and the Phoenix Cubs.

The Cubs have been defeated but once,
while in a far greater number of games
played. Mesa has been beaten only
twice. A new pitcher in the person
of “Em” McGowan, will be in the box
for Mesa. McGowan is an old time
Mesa boy, having pitched here during
his high school days. He has just re
turned from service in the army.

To Have Operation

Word has been received from Joe
Osner, who is still located with the
army in Newport News, Va., that he
was to undergo an operation for a tu
mor on his neck.

MESA, June 8.—At a meeting of the
hotel committee yesterday wherein all
of the directors except G. A. Stapley
were present, it was decided to post
pone all action toward the erection of
a hotel until after the vacation season.
Curtis Tobey, a hotel promoter and ex
pert in the matters pertaining to the
business of erecting and maintaining
hotels, was present, and the com
mittee went thoroughly into the matter
with him. Brought face to face with
all the problems connected with build
ing and equipping an institution that
would represent an outlay of at least
$100,000, the committee decided to
wait the opening of the fall season
and thus judge by the price of cotton
as to whether the building should be
undertaken this fall.

This publicity is given out by the
committee in order that the Mesa pub
lic may know just exactly the status of
affairs. That there is vital need of a
big hotel for Mesa is undisputed, and
that such a high class hotel would be
a paying proposition is likewise agreed
upon. Meanwhile the one thing that
is holding back the town is the lack of
first class entertainment facilities for
such patrons as demand the best in
the way of accommodations.

Carl Pomeroy Goes to Newport News.

Mr. and Mrs. Frank Pomeroy are in

port News, presumably for transport

about a year.

After an absence of several years,
during which time they resided on the
coast, Mr. and Mrs. Charles P. Munger
have returned to Phoenix to make their
future home.
Mr. Munger was the founder of the
Munger Bros. Olive Oil factory, one of
the largest industries of its kind on the
Pacific coast. In the future he will
be associated with the Kolberg Bros.
in the operation of the Arizona Laun

Chandler Realty Man Here.
J. L. Entrekin, realty dealer of
Chandler, was a business visitor in
Mesa yesterday. The worst of it was
that Mr. Entrekin looked up and down
the street and asked “Why is Mesa so
dull?” Funny how those Chandlerites
feel about their home town. One re
members when another booster from
the shade of the San Marcos wanted
to bet the newspaper man that Chand

Fords, Chevrolets and other light cars
in Utility trailers.
They will pull from two to five
times their rated load in addition to
carrying their capacity load. We have
two ton four wheel trailers and one
ton semi-trailers being pulled with
trucks. We have a three ton trailer
loaded for hay hauling behind a
three-quarter ton truck. One two-ton
truck is pulling two two-ton Utility
trailers and another two-ton truck two
three-ton trailers. These are all local
people who among many others are
appreciating the value of the trailer.
The trailer, continues Mr. Hartranft,
utilizes surplus power, power which
everywhere goes to waste. Contrast
what you can pull yourself with what
you are able to carry; apply it to your
own particular transportation
problems and you have the answer—
the trailer means economy in
transportation.

At the Majestic today will be seen

A TEST OF PATRIOTISM

(Chattanooga Times.)
The man who follows his cheering
with a job for a soldier is a real patriot.

City Park for Baseball Purposes
Manager Dixon of the Mesa ball
team stated yesterday that the mem
bers of the city council may grant
the use of a part of the vacant ten-acre
city park in the northern part of
town, as a ball park. This will neces
sitate the taking out of a few
umbrella chinas in the center of the
area but will still leave a large num
ber of trees around the edges. Now
Dixon is hunting some one with a
tractor big enough to pull the trees
out by the roots. He is using all his
powers of persuasion on the paving
company for the use of their big roller,
which with the Harrison grader tractor are
about the only two machines powerful
enough for the work.
The city park has ample room for
the needs of the ball ground and yet
leave a considerable space unoccupied.
It is the intention of the team to have
a grand stand erected, and the rest and
the number of shade trees on the edges
will afford relief for the spectators
from the summer heat.

Fifteen Miles of Sidewalk for Mesa
Fifteen miles of new sidewalk for
Mesa! This is in addition to the walks
already laid, and will constitute the
work next before the city. This ex
tensive improvement will make Mesa
one of the best equipped towns in the
country in the way of paved walks, for
the 15 miles include nearly every block
in town. The city engineer’s office is
busy making estimates and will be able
to report the last of June.
The 15 miles, however, is given out
as a certainty, and this will mean free
from dust and mud, and children
dry shod at school during the winter
instead of sitting during the school
hours with their shoes wet from drudg
ing along muddy sidewalks. As soon
as the council receives the engineer’s
report further steps will be taken to
ward the immediate prosecution of the
work.

Eastern Star Social Club.
The Eastern Star Social club will
hold a meeting in the Masonic hall,
Monday afternoon at 2:30 o’clock. All
members and those eligible to mem
bership are invited to attend.

Personal Mention.
Dr. F. D. Rowell, of Gilbert, was a
Mesa visitor yesterday.
Mrs. A. C. Robbins is visiting with
her mother Mrs. David Wallace of
Mesa. Mrs. Robbins accompanied her
husband in from the Sunflower ranch,
on a drive with several hundred fat
cattle for shipment.
Mrs. Sheehan, mother of W. A. Riggs
will leave today for a visit to Prescott.
She will be accompanied by her grand
daughter, Dorothy.

One of the four plants of the Salt
River Valley Water Users’ association
at the Roosevelt Dam, which supply
electric energy for a number of the large
mines of the state and to the city of
Phoenix, was tied up by a walkout
yesterday, when the association refused
a demand for a closed shop and in
creased wages.

Officials of the association an
nounced that with Saturday’s peak load
to handle, they had been forced to call
on the emergency steam plant of the
Inspiration Copper company at Miami
to take care of the
power for that district. In Phoenix, the
emergency steam plant of the Phoenix
Gas and Electric company also has been
pressed into service.

It was stated that the demand for a
closed shop and increased wages was
presented on behalf of the men by T. J.
Croaff, president of the Arizona State
Federation of Labor, and Fred H. Ger
ard, general labor agent here. W. R.
Elliott, general superintendent of the
Salt River Valley Water Users’ association,
which distributes the power of the
Roosevelt Dam, declared it was impos
sible to meet the closed shop ultima
tum, and the walkout resulted.

Reports Vary on Men Out
Union officials last night asserted
that upwards of 100 operators and
linemen had left their posts at the dam
and throughout the Salt River Valley.
The announcement by the association
was to the effect that at the dam four
operators had quit, and in the valley
four more, while ten linemen had left
their work, making a total of 18 who,
the association officials asserted, had
walked out. The number of employes
of the association was placed at about
350.

The demand for increased wages was
said by association officials to include
an increase of from $6 to $7 a day for line
men and of from $125 to $150 a month
for operators. It was stated by the
officials that until a week ago there
had been no union operators on their
payroll, but that organizers recently
had been active in the ranks.

More than 50 per cent of the power
plant employes had refused to join the
union, said association officials.

In Hands of Mediator

Union officials stated late last night
that they had placed their case in the
hands of Federal Mediator Hywell
Davies and they expected an amicable
adjustment of the difficulty.

An official of the Water Users’ Asso
ciation asserted last night that the
employees at the power plant had or
ganized expressly to go on strike, which
had been contemplated before the
union organization. He also declared
that at least four of the association’s
linemen, to his personal knowledge had
wished to go on with their work, being
satisfied with conditions, but had been
forced to quit with the others by the
strikers. These men, he added, had
started for the mines, disgusted with
the affair and determined to find a
place where they could work in peace.

THE TRAILER WAY
IN TRANSPORTATION

How much will my auto or my truck
pull in addition to the load it carries?
is a frequent question asked Mr. Hart
ranft, distributor of Utility trailers. In
reply he states that the lightest auto
will handle a one-ton Utility trailer
with ease. We have patrons who are
hauling over a ton and a half behind
them.
