FOR TUNGSTEN
ALONG BILL WILLIAMS
DENVER EXPERT STEPS IN FROM
WICKENBURG.

Other Events of Recent Date
Along the Hassayampa.

Wickenburg, July 16.—(Special Cor
respondence of The Republican.) A.
H. Hale of Denver, Colo., a mining
expert is in town enroute for the Bill
Williams country, in search of mining
properties containing tungsten ore.
Tungsten is a heavy metal of a
grayish-white color necessary in the
manufacture of high grade steel.
Tungsten was discovered about one
hundred years ago, but thus far very
little progress has been made in the
mining of it. It is only necessary to
quote the present market quotations to
prove this assertion. Ore containing
50 per cent tungsten acid is worth on
the market today $6 a unit, which is
equal to $360 per ton. The Schneiders
of Creusot, France, are one of the
greatest manufacturers of armor plate
in the world. The fact that they con
trol an American patent, No. 283,599,
which calls for 3 per cent tungsten in
a certain phase of armor plate, is evi
dence enough to create a heavy demand for
this valuable metal. Besides tungsten
is in demand by nearly all steel manu
facturers, both here and abroad.
There are but three forms of tung
sten ore considered of commercial
value, namely, wolframite, hubnerite,
and scheelite. The fact that Mr. Hale
says that some samples of tungsten
ore taken from the Bill Williams coun
try, is the best he ever saw, cannot
be missed lightly.
The different boards of trade in this
territory would perhaps do well to se
cure samples of such ores and put
them on display throughout the coun
try to help prospectors familiarize
themselves with said ores.
Some good samples of wolframite
can be obtained from Boulder county,
Colo., scheelite in San Bernardino
county, Cal., and hubnerite can be
had from the state of Montana.
Circulars are being distributed an
nouncing a social dance to be given at
Baxter’s opera house this Saturday
night. A four piece orchestra will fur
nish the music.
Dr. Flemming left for Phoenix on
this afternoon’s train on business.
P. H. Arnold of San Francisco paid
us a visit.
William Strickland, the well known
mining man is in Wickenburg.
George Sayers of Sayersville, is here
on business.
William Neagle of the firm of
Neagle & Bozarth, left for Phoenix on
important business connected with the
firm.
Let us hope that Moses Katem, the
Jap milkman, who claims to have been
robbed of $17, will not try to get even
with Wickenburgers in general.
The usual services at the Presby
terian church will be held Sunday.

Anyone contemplating spending the
summer at Flagstaff will find all the
