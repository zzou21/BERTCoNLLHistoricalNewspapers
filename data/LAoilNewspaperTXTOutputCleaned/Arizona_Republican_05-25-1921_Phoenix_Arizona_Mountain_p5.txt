KIWANIS
TO MEET
ROTARIANS IN TWO
EVENTS SATURDAY

With the announcement that the
Rotary club has accepted definitely
the challenge of the Kiwanis club
for a baseball game at Riverside
next Saturday afternoon for the
benefit of the Maricopa County Wel
fare League, almost the entire ses
sion of the club at its weekly lunch
eon at the Y. M. C. A. yesterday
was devoted to getting the club in
shape to support the aggregation of
nonpareils which will represent it
on the diamond at the end of the
week. With the acceptance of the chal
lenge it was discovered that the Ro
tarians have invited 400 high school
boys to attend the game as rooters
for the Rotary team. As soon as this
piece of news was given to the Ki
wanians, an immediate invitation was
extended to 400 high school girls
to attend as the guests of the lat
ter, without even the implied stipu
lation that they should cheer for the
Kiwanian stalwarts, although it is
believed that the girls will do this of
their own free will after they see the
great disparity between the two teams.

There will be two games Saturday.
The first will be between teams of
the two clubs which have been chos
en by their opponents, the Kiwan
ians selecting the Rotarian players
and the Rotarians selecting those to
represent Kiwanis. This game, which
will be played with indoor baseballs
and wheelbarrows for the outfield
ers, will last three innings. Then
will come the big game, seven in
nings of real baseball, with a band
and a continual succession of fea
tures calculated to keep the crowd
on its feet.

The Kiwanis line-up will approxi
mate the following, although there
may be several changes later in the
week because of the large aggregation
of talent which has been uncovered
in the club:
Laurel Stapley, catcher; Jack Mar
tin, pitcher; Dave Goldberg and L.
D. Hitchcock, first base; A. J. Kis
elburgh, second base; James Leach,
shortstop; George Judson, third base;
Paul Bennett, Al Vieult and Wes
Carpenter, outfielders.

The Rotary line-up, as announced
last evening, is as follows:
Peter Venne, pitcher; Kim Ban
nister, catcher and pitcher; W. W.
Lawhon, first base; Charles McAr
thur, second base; Claude Decatur
Jones, catcher; Howard Peck, third
base; Guy Chism, shortstop; John B.
Brown, Bill Knox and A. C. Taylor,
outfielders, and Marcus Kelly and
Bill Heflin, substitutes.

Because the Rotary club has hid
den its roster to keep the Kiwanis
outfit from selecting the team for
the first game, the line-up cannot
be made public, although the Rota
rians have selected the Kiwanians whom
they feel will oppose. The Kiwanis
team will include the following, who
will have to furnish their own uni
forms: James H. Mulrein, left field; Ben
Carter, first base; Vernon Clark,
right field; Karl Drake, second base;
Royal W. Lescher, third base; Colin
Eagan, pitcher; Harry J. Goss,
pitcher; A. M. Tuthill, catcher; Hiram
Maus, center fielder; William Wilk
inson, shortstop, and Al McLellan,
water boy.

The game will begin at 3 o'clock.
Preceding it there will be a parade
in which the four teams, the mem
bers of the two clubs and perhaps a
feature or two, will march through
the business district, led by the In
dian School band, which will also
play at the park during the games.
John B. Brown, Rotarian superin
tendent of the Indian school, will
bring the band.

The Rotary team will practice at
the Indian School grounds at 5
o'clock this evening, with Charles
McArthur acting as captain.

The sale of tickets for the game
was started yesterday, and indica
tions are that a record crowd will
see the contests. As is usual in any
contest, the Rotarians join with the
Kiwanians in promising every fan
and fannette who attends the game
more than the worth of his or her
money, not only in the brand of base
ball, but in at least two hours of
the finest kind of amusement.

The Kiwanis meeting yesterday
was opened by President Royal W.
Lescher, who outlined the plans for
the baseball game, and then pro
ceeded to the introduction of guests,
after which Wes Carpenter led the
members in yell practice for Satur
day.

Vernon L. Clark then took charge
of the meeting as the chairman of
the day. After complimenting him
self on the glories that would fol
low his handling of the gavel, he
ordered the drawing of the attend
ance prize, which was won by Hiram
Maus. The prize, three pairs of silk
sox, was given by James Leach.
A letter concerning Clinton Camp
bell, who is making a trip to Canada,
was read. The letter is directed to
Kiwanis clubs along the route and
bespeaks the assistance of all the
clubs should Clinton suffer any
lapses.

Frank Schwentker delivered the
address of the day, which was an ex
amination of the reasons for the pres
ident’s proclamation asking for the
observance of Fire Protection Week.
Schwentker also took occasion to il
lustrate his talk by a description of
a camping trip to the mountains of
New Mexico, where he had frequent
opportunity to observe the work of
the forest rangers and their system
for preventing and fighting fires.

The meeting was ended by a talk
by J. Oscar Sexson on the bond elec
tion Friday. The guests of the club
yesterday were G. K. Reynolds, Dr.
Arthur Lee Odell, Ed Hull, George A.
Judson, Jr., E. G. Scott, Mr. Hull, J.
C. Raymond, C. L. Stockton, Pres
cott; W. A. Womble, Tucson; Claude
Decatur Jones, Daniel F. Jantzen
and E. J. Fentchurch.

The New York assembly has passed
a bill placing a fine on landlords
who refuse to admit tenants with
children.

VERMONTER HEARS OF
CHARMS OF VALLEY

That every Phoenician may do his
or her share in boosting Phoenix and
the Salt River valley is shown by the
following clipping from the Barre
Daily Times, Barre, Vt.:
“At the close of the Rebekah lodge
meeting Friday evening those present
enjoyed a trip to Arizona by the way
of pictures and curios exhibited by
Mrs. Viola A. Bemis, who has recent
ly returned from Phoenix, Ariz.”
Mrs. Bemis is the wife of M. H.
Bemis, assistant secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce.

EXCLUSIVE USE OF HOME DAIRY
PRODUCTS URGED

A number of the groceries of
Phoenix have shown their loyalty to
the valley as well as good judgment
by endorsing the plan of handling
only valley dairy products and urg
ing their use in the place of dairy
products shipped in.
The chamber of commerce has been
advised that there is at the present
time a sufficient quantity of dairy
products to supply the present needs.
This includes fresh milk, fresh cream,
milk for ice cream, butter, cheese
and condensed milk. Consumers gain
nothing by handling a brand of but
ter, milk or cheese that is produced
outside, although higher than that of
the valley.
While there is a well known maxim
that there is no substitute for milk,
it is a fact that there is a product
on the market which is a combination
of skimmed milk and vegetable fats.

While this has something of the same
appearance and is of considerable
food value, it does not have the food
value that whole milk does.
Scientists within the past few years
have discovered that there are cer
tain properties in the butter fat of
milk which cannot be substituted by
vegetable fats. It is of no particular
concern to the person who does not
care to go into the scientific side of
it as to just why this is so. Now
that dairy products are so much
lower in price, almost to the pre
war level in fact, much wider use of
milk should be encouraged by the
thrifty housewife. Money spent for
milk will purchase more food value
by far than can be bought for the
same money expended for meat.
A story is told of an old dairy
farmer in the Middle West who got
sick and was sent to a sanatorium.
The doctor and nurses didn’t do a
thing but feed him milk, and inci
dentally charged him several hun
dred dollars. Possibly it was worth
it, but there are cheaper ways of
learning the value of the dairy pro
ducts.

WEIGHT GIVEN WAS
FOUND INCORRECT

Seizure of several cases of fig bars
was made by Raymond Dyas, state
inspector of weights and measures,
from a local dealer yesterday. The
packages were marked 84 ounces,
according to Mr. Dyas, while in re
ality the goods weighed 64 ounces.
Mr. Dyas stated that the merchant
whose goods were confiscated had
bought the article in good faith from
a Kansas City biscuit company. He
said that the company had advised
him that it would make adjustment,
but he was informed that unless he
went over every package and changed
the weight mark he would violate the
state law in disposing of the goods
over his counters.
The state weights and measures in
spector said that under the state law
he could not prosecute the Kansas
firm, but that the matter might be
taken up by the federal authorities.

STUDENTS OF MINES
SCHOOL PARTY VISITS CITY

Among the visitors to Phoenix yes
terday was a party from the Mis
souri School of Mines, under the di
rection of Maj. C. R. Forbes, pro
fessor of mining, the members of
which have just concluded an ex
amination of the Bisbee, Miami,
Globe, Ray and Ajo districts. The
party has been on the road for about
three weeks, and about the same
length of time will elapse before it
is brought to an end.

From Phoenix the party goes to
Los Angeles and thence to the oil
fields at Bakersfield. From Bakers
field they will go to the gold dredg
ing workings at Sacramento and in
the Grass Valley. An examination
of the Utah copper district will fol
low, and then the party will go to
Colorado, examining the mines at
Leadville and the smelter works at
Pueblo.

Those composing the party under
Maj. Forbes are S. M. Burke, St.
Louis; H. C. Hubbard, Philadelphia;
M. V. Healey, Lexington, Ky.; C. K.
Cameron, Henrietta, Okla.; and P.
D. Windsor, Belleville, Ill.

PLANS DEVELOPMENT
ON BIG DOMAIN

Edward Brown returned yesterday
from Mexico, where he completed the
details of the transfer to him of a
concession from the government of
Mexico to approximately 300,000
acres of oil and agricultural lands
immediately south of the internation
al line below Yuma. These lands lie
along the eastern side of the Colorado
river and the Gulf of California.
Mr. Brown, who is a well known
citizen of Phoenix, is now completing
arrangements for the development of
his valuable concession. The devel
opment will include the building of a
railroad from the border south of
Yuma, connecting with the United
States government railroad at the
border, which in turn connects with
the Southern Pacific at Yuma, thus
making Arizona a maritime state.
Other enterprises to be developed
are the fisheries along the coast, the
oil fields, large areas of agricultural
land, and the establishment of towns,
one of which will be at the port, sit
uated 65 miles south of the border.
In addition to the regular features
of a deep sea port there will be an
international racing track and facili
ties for other sporting events not
available in the United States.
The business and legal details are
being handled at the offices of Joseph
K. Morrison in the Heard building.
Mr. Morrison is general counsel for
the entire enterprise.

Throughout the United States the
American Legion is now represented
by 10,200 posts and 2,150 auxiliary
units.

MR. AND MRS. BRONCE JACKSON

LAWRENCE, Kan. — If you are
spending too much time thinking of
him and your college work is getting
the short end of things, marry him!
Thus says Dorothy Jackson, Uni
versity of Kansas co-ed, who followed
her own theory and is finding happi
ness as well as progress in mixing
housework with the study of Black
stone. Her husband, Bronce Jackson,
is also studying law.
“Common interests are what young
people need,” says Mrs. Jackson, “so
living together and studying together
is an aid to happiness and helps us
understand each other.”

UNIVERSITY CLUB

The University of Arizona club will
hold an important meeting Monday
evening at 8 o’clock at 507 North

Officers for the year were elected
at the recent meeting, as follows: C.
Z. Lesher, president; Miss Bess Bark
ley, vice-president; Mrs. Katheryn
Moore, secretary; T. Trevilian, treas
urer.

The Paris chamber of commerce
