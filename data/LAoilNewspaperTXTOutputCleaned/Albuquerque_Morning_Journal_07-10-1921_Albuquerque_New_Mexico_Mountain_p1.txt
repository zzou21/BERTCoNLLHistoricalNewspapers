OLD STRAW HAT
IS HAILED INTO
TARIFF DEBATE
BY DEMOCRATS

Frayed Chapeau Is
Illustrate Their
Contention That Rates
Used to
New
Bill Are Excessive.
SOLID WEEK OF TALK
FACES HOUSE MEMBERS
Garner of Texas Leads Attack; There Are Many
Sharp Exchanges While
He Occupies the Floor.
(By The Associated Press.)
Washington, July 9. An old
straw hat was the article used by
Democrats in opening their attack
in the House today on the Fordney
protective tariff bill to illustrate
their contention that its rates were
higher than anything written into
the Payne-Aldrich bill a decade
ago.
Representative Garner of Texas,
ranking Democrat on the Ways and
Means Committee, in the course
of a two-hour denunciation of the
measure, seized the hat as the first
object within sight and challenged
Republican members of the com
mittee to say offhand what duty
had been imposed upon it.
Moment's Hesitation.
There was a moment's hesitation.
Then in the midst of a shout from
the minority side, Representative
Green, Republican, Iowa, arose and
brought an answering shout from
the Republican side by announcing
that it was printed in the bill.
Still waving the faded headgear,
Mr. Garner declared that in the
Payne-Aldrich bill the duty on that
product was 30 per cent but in the
Fordney measure it was $10 a
dozen, plus an ad valorem duty of
.20 per cent, which made the actual
import tax, he added, 61 2-6 per
cent. Comparison of the two bills,
he said, would show the same
scales running through the 846
pages of the Fordney measure.
The average rate of the Fordney
measure, he added, was higher than
any ever proposed before by con
gress. Attacking the American valua
tion provisions Mr. Garner charged
that if it had been applied to the
present Underwood law rates now
being paid would exceed the Payne
schedules in every instance.
Many Sharp Exchanges.
There were many sharp ex
changes while Mr. Garner had the
floor. Most of the verbal battles
raged around the valuation provi
sion and Mr. Garner declared that
the most glaring evidence of how it
would shoot rates skyward was to
be found in the case of reed furni
ture, much of which is shipped
here from Japan.
In quoting from a letter received
from a manufacturer at Grand
Rapids, Mich., Mr. Garner charged
that because of the peculiar condi
tions entering into foreign produc
tion the reed furniture rate figured
exactly 1,497 per cent higher than
the Underwood tariff, which stipu
lated a duty of 15 per cent against
Fordney's 60 per cent.
Debate Starts With Rush.
With the principal speeches for
and against the bill out of the way
the debate was turned over to
members generally and it started
with a rush under an agreement
calling for a solid week of talk.
The name of Secretary Mellon
was brought into the discussion by
Representative Oldfield of Arkan
sas, a Democratic member of the
Ways and Means Committee, who
described the Treasury Secretary as
one of the beneficiaries of the high
tariff. He said that "the Mellons
control the aluminum industry of
the United States" and called at
tention to the increase in duty to
5 cents a pound on aluminum.
Doesn't Blame Mellon.
"Of course," he added "I am not
blaming Secretary Mellon. He did
not write this bill, had nothing to
do with it. His group paid 12 per
cent dividend on $20,000,000 of
capital last year and I want to
know why it is necessary to give
them more."
Representative Green sought to
explain that the five-cent duty
"means nothing" to the consumer.
He illustrated his statement with
the cost of the old kitchen stew
pan, saying that less than half a
pound of aluminum was used in its
manufacture, but Mr. Oldfield as-
serted that whether the amount
was great or small, the consumer
was being taxed for the benefit of
the manufacturer.
Representative Mondell, the Re
publican floor leader, spoke briefly
near the close of the day, paying
tribute to the Republican members
of the Ways and Means Committee
for the work they had done in draft
ing the bill. He declared that not
withstanding the many handicaps
under which the bill was framed,
"this bill has met with a more fa
vorable response from the country
than from any like measure pre
sented in a generation," and added
that "this approval will in my opin
ion, grow rather than diminish as
the provisions are examined and
analyzed."

SMALL RIOT RESULTS
WHEN AGES OF WOMEN
VOTERS ARE POSTED
North Brookfield, Mass.,
July 9. It was only 90 in
the shade yesterday afternoon
when the assessors posted a
list of 900 female voters in
the town, but it was estimated
to be 120 in the assessors' of
fice today when it became
known that each name was
followed by the age of the
voter. Not satisfied with
storming the assessors' office,
many of the women attacked
the list with erasers. The list
was accepted as authority for
settling many long-standing
arguments as to age.

CELEBRATES ITS
75TH BIRTHDAY!
Ceremony of 1846, When
the American Colors Were
Raised, Borrowed From
Past in Every Detail.
(By The Associated Press.)
San Francisco, Calif., July 9.
San Francisco reached back
through seventy-five years on its
birthday today and enacted anew
the ceremony when Commander J.
B. Montgomery, U. S. N., put out
from the little man-of-war Portsmouth
in San Francisco Bay and ushered in
to the world the first American city
on this rim of the continent.
The white beach that he and his
men trod for a few hundred yards
before reaching the flagpole in
front of the old Spanish adobe cus
tomshouse now is a busy canyon
bordered by skyscraping business
structures but it was walked again
today by a simulated Montgomery
and a ship's company.
The ceremony of July 9, 1846,
when the American colors were
raised and the Mexican alcalde no
tified that the city was under
American rule was borrowed from
the past in every detail. Battleships
of the Pacific fleet boomed a salute
as the colors went up and 2,000 for
mer service men and others followed
the little band representative of
Montgomery and his crew, the In
dians, Spanish dons and others that
had gathered around San Fran
cisco's run. The ceremonies
were under the
direction of the
Bohemian club.
CHARGE OF SABOTAGE
MADE AGAINST CREW
OF P. & O. LINER
(By The Associated Press.)
Naples, July 9 (by the Associated
Press.) The captain of the Amer
ican steamer Pocahontas, which ar
rived here Monday after more than
a month at sea with an insubordi
nate crew, has submitted a full re
port to the American consul.
The report has been presented
by the consul to the Italian autho-
rities, with whom the
crew have
filed charges of cruelty against the
captain. These charges are de-
nied, and the captain accuses the
crew of sabotage in his report, re-
cording daily events as they hap-
pened during the voyage.

QUAKER ELK IS
MADE CHIEF OF
PUEBLO INDIANS
Ceremony Is Conferred In
Elks' Home by Chief
Landi-Olfi, Aged Chieftain
of the Great Southwest.

Charles H. Grakew, exalted
ruler of the Philadelphia Elks, left
Duke City at 5:30 o'clock, on one
of the three delegate "specials,
a full-fledged Pueblo Indian chief.
The impressive ceremonies which
featured his adoption and the con
ferring of the honorary chieftain
ship upon the Quaker City ruler
was performed at the Elks' club
in the new ballroom.
The three special trains which
are carrying the Philadelphia Elks
to the annual convention at Los
Angeles, arrived here shortly after
8 o'clock yesterday afternoon. A
procession was formed headed by
exalted ruler Grover Divine and
exalted ruler Grakew and the
numbered piece Quaker Elk band.
The line of march was up Central
avenue to Fifth street and to the
Elks' home, where all arrange
ments had been made for the
ceremony of the day.
The visiting and local Elks made
their way into the spacious new
ballroom to the soft beating of
the Indian drums by the group of
Indians which occupied the center
of the ballroom directly below
Olfi (Great Heart), who was to
bestow the honor of sharing his
chieftainship with the visiting and
soon to be adopted Quaker.
As the tom-toms beat out a more
solemn dirge, Charles Grakew,
exalted ruler of the
Philadelphia Elks, was led in by two
high members of the Pueblos.
At a point below Chief Landi-Olfi's
chair, a few words were spoken, words
of adoption so seldom used by the
Indians that but few of them un
derstand them, except their general
meaning. The pipe of peace and
brotherhood was then solemnly
smoked by Chief Landi-Olfi and
passed to his paleface brother who
in turn whiffed of the strong na
tive tobacco and in so whiffing
became a Pueblo Indian chieftain,
named, in translation, Chief Big
Heart.
With the passing of the pipe
around, the tom-toms beat out a wild,
rhythmic refrain and the Indian
dancers arose to their feet and danced
the adoption dance, never before danced
by these particular Indians in
public, as there has been no adop
tion since they became dancers.
The dance was taught them by
their fathers in the privacy of
Antler cave.
Following the ceremony, Judge
M. E. Hickey, past exalted ruler of
the local lodge, addressed the vis
itors and bid them welcome to Al
buquerque and on behalf of the
local Antlers, presented Chief Big
Heart, as the representative of the
Quaker City delegation, a Navajo
rug, woven especially for the vis
itors. Aside from having the large
head of an elk woven in its center,
it carried along its border the In
dian symbols for "charity, fidelity,
justice, and brotherly love," the
axioms of the Elk fraternity.
The unique rug was accepted by
Chief Big Heart on behalf of his
lodge.
Dancing, refreshments and auto
mobile rides through the city com
pleted the program for the after
noon. The visiting delegates' band,
of nearly 100 pieces, marched to
the station at 6:20 o'clock and
played a number of selections un
til train time. It is said to be the
largest band which has ever played
in Albuquerque.
LIQUOR SHIPMENTS TO
MEXICO THROUGH U. S.
PORTS TO BE BARRED
(By The Associated Press.)
Nogales, Ariz., July 9. Customs
officers here today received a tele
gram from Washington directing
them to permit no more liquor
consigned to points in Mexico to
pass through United States ports
after July 16. It has been the
practice to ship a carload or more
of beer each week, from Monterey
to Nogales, Sonora, via Nogales,
Ariz., and occasional shipments of
whisky from Guaymas, Nogales, So
nora, have come via Calexico, Mex-
icali and Tucson and Nogales,
Arizona.
The telegram said that the new
order was based on an opinion ren
dered by the United States attorney
general June 30.
Nogales, Sonora, will not be
without beer as a result of the rul
ing, however, because arrange
ments are being made to start pro
duction in an old brewery in Her
mosillo, Sonora, 150 miles south of
Nogales.
3RD INTERNATIONALE
APPROVES POLICIES
OF SOVIET COMMUNISTS.
(By The Associated Press.)
Riga, July 9 (by the Associated Press.) According to an official
Moscow radio message, the con
gress of the Third Internationale.
heard a speech by Nikolai Lenin,
approving the Soviet communists. The resolu-
tion
read: "Keep the dictatorship or
intensify it in Russia until our western brethren can come to our aid."
Soviet Russia, Lenin said, was
rebuilding her own industries,
during a breathing spell in the
struggle with international capital
ism. "We do not dare
to attack her. Meanwhile, the
communists must use this same
breathing spell to prepare a revo
lution against all capitalist coun
tries," he said.
ABLE TO TALK AFTER
BEING DUMB 9 MONTHS
Montreal, July 9. C. Livermore of
Ogdensburg, N. Y., was able to talk
today after being dumb for nine
months as a result of shell shock.
His voice came to him last night
when a thunderstorm shook the
steamer Rapids King on which he
was traveling from Toronto.

Birds In the White House
Grounds Will Not Be Ex
terminated; John Bur
roughs Clubs praised.
(By The Associated Press.)
Washington, July 9. President
Harding has approved the finding
of the school boys' jury which de
cided that the owls in the White
House grounds may live. Interest
in the subject was widespread
among nature-loving children all
over the country, hundreds of
whom submitted briefs to the
American Forestry association,
which arranged the trial.
The president today addressed
his approval to Jimmy Bradley, a
Washington school boy and mem
bers of a John Burroughs club who
headed the jury, in the following
letter:
"My Dear Jimmy:
"Your conclusion is that the
balance is in favor even of the
least desirable of the birds, and
I am inclined to agree with
you. For, why should these
birds have been put here, un
less to perform some useful
services? On the whole, I
think we will grant them a re
prieve. I think your John
Burroughs club must be do
ing a useful work; I hope you
will continue your nature
studies and that later on when
you all become men and wo
men you will be as much dis
posed to apply the rules of
equity and justice as you have
been in this case.
"Most sincerely yours,
"WARREN G. HARDING."

THE BOYS' JURY

TO SUBSCRIBERS

The new press is installed and is printing your
morning paper for you each day. The expense of ship
ping and erecting this press was about $12,000. Had
we known how tight money would be at the time of de
livery of the press, we might have lacked the courage
to undertake this $30,000 enterprise. However, we or
dered it a year ago and we are glad we did. It is a
big step forward for the Journal, for Albuquerque and
for New Mexico. It means a better Journal for our
readers.
We still lack $4,000 of having the money we need
to pay the installation expense. We are asking each
subscriber to help a little by paying up a year in ad
vance, or for six months, or even for three months. If
ten per cent of our subscribers would pay for one year,
our problem would be solved. Will you not be one to
encourage our enterprise in your behalf by such a pay
ment? The amount is small, but the aggregate will be
sufficient if our friends will take the trouble to act
today. To make it worth your while we offer you:
One Year's Subscription $8.00
Six Months' Subscription $4.00
Three Months' Subscription $2.00
This applies to new, past-due or advance-payment
subscriptions.
As one of our family we ask you to aid us now.
You will pay before long anyway and it will be a real
help at this time.

VOLSTEAD, THE SEAL
BORN AT AQUARIUM IN
METROPOLIS, IS DEAD
(By The Associated Press.)
New York, July 9. Volstead,
the seal recently born at Aqua-
rium, is dead. Some said it
died because there was not
enough water; others declared
it died because the young
ster refused to drink from a
bottle.
The day the baby seal came
into the world, the mother
rescued it from the furious
father. After that she neg
lected to feed her offspring,
and the infant scorned a bottle
offered by aquarium attend
ants.
There was no way to amend
the seal's constitution so that
it would live without drink.

ANGLO-IRISH ROW IS
APPROACHING AN END,
IS BELIEF IN ROME
(By The Associated Press.)
Rome, July 9 (by the Associated
Press.) News that Eamonn de
Valera, the Irish Republican leader,
had accepted the invitation of
Mr. Lloyd George, the British
prime minister, to go to London for
a conference on the Irish situation
is considered here to be an indica
tion that the Anglo-Irish struggle
is approaching an end.
Much satisfaction was expressed
today over the news, especially at
the Vatican, since the Holy See has
been working under great difficul
ties, wishing to remain on good
terms with England but feeling
sympathy for Ireland. Pope Bene
dict had a long interview with
Cardinal Gasparri, papal secre
tary of state, today in which he ex
pressed hope for an end of the
violence in Ireland, which he con
demned on the part of the Sinn
Feiners as well as the crown
forces.

INKABERCASE

Admission of Certain Alleged
Confessions Will Be Ruled
On When the Trial Is Re
sumed Monday.
(By The Associated Press.)
Cleveland, Ohio, July 9.
Through direct testimony and al
leged confessions the state today
sought to link together pieces of a
chain of evidence it has been weld
ing to prove a conspiracy which
culminated in the murder of Daniel
F. Kaber, for which his widow,
Eva Catherine Kaber, is being
tried.
Whether the confessions, al
leged to have been made by Salva
tore Cala, who the state claims,
actually killed Kaber, and Mrs.
Erminia Colavito, claimed by the
state to have procured the assassins
for Mrs. Kaber, are permitted to go
to the jury depends upon a ruling
to be made by Judge Bernon when
the trial is resumed Monday. The
confessions were presented in open
court today in the absence of the
jury.
Mrs. Colavito gave in direct tes
timony voluntarily today all that
was contained in her alleged con
fession. She is being held on a
first-degree murder charge.
Mrs. Colavito detailed how Mrs.
Kaber came to her to get her to do
something to cure her husband's
nasty habits; how she gave Mrs.
Kaber medicine for him; how Mrs.
Kaber met Cala and Vittorio Pisselli,
another of the alleged murder
ers; how Mrs. Kaber and the two
men planned to execute the mur
der; how they compelled her to
solicit Mrs. Kaber for money which
she was alleged to have promised
in payment of the killing of her
husband; how the men threatened
to kill her if she did not get the
money for them, and how finally
she did get $600, a diamond ring
and a watch from Mrs. Kaber for
them.
The state is expected to attempt
to introduce the alleged confession
of Mrs. Kaber made in New York
after her apprehension there.
County Prosecutor Stanton today
received a typewritten copy of the
confession.
FORMER EMPEROR AND
COUNCIL IN ROW OVER
PAYING LOCAL TAXES
(By The Associated Press.)
London, July 9. Former Em
peror William is in conflict with
the municipal council at Doorn over
the question of paying local taxes,
and the pressure of the law is
threatened to enforce payment, ac
cording to a Doorn dispatch to the
Daily Mail.
William is said to have contended that
the municipality is not entitled to
demand the tax levied against him
because he came to Holland "un
wittingly" and is practically held
a prisoner; therefore he is not lia
ble to taxation as a free citizen. It
is maintained by the council that
he came voluntarily.
William, it is added, has also
protested against the income tax
which it was decided last October
he must pay the Dutch govern
ment.
A TAILLESS CALF BORN.
Pana, Ill., July 9. A livestock
freak in the form of a tailless calf

Cruthers, near here, today. Be
cause the new arrival refused to

ers declared it was "off at both
ends."

THIRST-MADDENED BOYS
WELCOME CAPTURE ON
CHARGE OF ROBBERY
(By The Associated Press.)
El Centro, Calif., July 9. Mad
dening thirst and helpless isolation
in the wastes of the Imperial
desert made capture welcome for
five arrested today near here fol
lowing their purported confession
of the theft of four automobiles and
the robbery of a store.
The boys ranged in age from 16
to 18 years and included Michael
Donovan, 17, of Chicago. They
are charged with burglary and lar
ceny.
According to the story, they left
Los Angeles in a stolen automobile
and obtained gasoline and oil by
robbing cars along the highway. In
one instance they set fire to an
automobile, from which they at
tempted to purloin gasoline. At
Calexico they abandoned the auto-
mobile in which they were riding
and took another in front of the
customs house. They drove on to
the desert, where their gasoline was
exhausted. A rancher found them
in the desert and brought
them to Holtville near here where
they were arrested.

(By The Associated Press.)
Phoenix, Ariz., July 9. Crop
conditions in Arizona on July 1
were generally better than on June
1 of this year, despite the fact that

in June 1, according to a report
issued today by L. M. Harrison,
agricultural statistician in charge
of the local office of the United
States bureau of market and crop

HELD TO VIEW OF DERBY
Great Britain Ought to be
Prepared to Make Sacri
fices to Secure a Settle
ment, Says in Speech.
(By The Associated Press.)
Southport, England, July 9 (by
the Associated Press.) Lord Der
by, who has been mentioned as one
of those likely to be designated by
the government to meet repre
sentatives of northern and southern
Ireland in an endeavor to ne
gotiate an acceptable compromise
of the Irish question in a speech
here today said Great Britain ought
to be prepared to make sacrifices
to secure a settlement. If neces
sary, he declared, he was ready to
go very far in the way of conces
sions. "Having caused Ireland, so to
speak, to stand upon her own legs,
we should do everything possible
to strengthen those legs," Lord
Derby said.
With restrictions concerning the
national debt and payment for the
army and navy, he declared, he
would be willing to give full finan
cial control to Ireland. He would
not be barred by fear of customs
duties, he added, from giving his
heartiest approval to anything
Prime Minister Lloyd George might
do to restore peace in Ireland.

SINN FEIN KING'S TROOPS
FRATERNIZE IN

STREETS

Without an Ever-Present
Fear of Being Shot By
Unseen Forces.
CONCLUSION OF TRUCE
STIRS GREAT BRITAIN
De Valera Urges
National
Unity; Warns
Against
'Undue Confidence'
Result of Meeting,
in
(By The Associated Press.)
London, July 9 (by the Associated
Press.) Not since the memorable day when the armistice was
declared ending the great war has
any event so stirred the United
Kingdom as the conclusion of the
truce in the Irish warfare, sealed
today by the issuance of orders to
make it effective. Simultaneously
came the announcement that Ea
monn de Valera, the Republican
leader, and Mr. Lloyd-George, the
British prime minister, would
meet, probably next week, to con
fer with a view of settling the centuries-old
difficulty.
Heartfelt Rejoicing.
The Ulster press has received
the development coldly, but
throughout southern and western
Ireland, and in all England, there
is rejoicing which unmistakably is
heartfelt.
For the first time in many
weary months of bloodshed the
soldiers of the crown were today
fraternizing with Sinn Feiners in
the streets of Dublin and one
might walk about freely without
an ever-present fear of being shot
by unseen forces.
From isolated districts, some
reports came of continuing violence,
but nothing of an outstanding
character. Word of the truce
could hardly have been distributed
to all points in Ireland so soon.
Peace is predicted.
Predictions were freely made
today in responsible quarters that
the Irish trouble would be brought
to an end.
The exact date of the meeting
between Premier Lloyd George and
Mr. de Valera has not been settled,
but no time will be lost in arrang
ing for the conversations. Safe con
ducts are being prepared for the
Republican leader and such of his
associates as desire to bring to
London.

Your discretion must prove in

"Unbending determination to
endure all that may still be
necessary and fortitude such as
you have shown in all your re

will lead to the peace you de
sire. Should force be resumed
against our nation you must be

to resist. Thus alone will you

of force and the acceptance of
justice and reason as the ar
bitrator. (Signed)
