SPECULATORS
DEPRESSING
PRICE CLAIMED
Senator Heflin, of Alabama,
Tells Senate 26 Cents For
Staple Is Not Enough
MIDDLING WORTH 30 CENTS
Law of Supply and Demand
Warrants That Price Or Better
Alabama Scion Asserts
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.—Declaring
that cotton consumption figures
for November, as announced yesterday,
indicated a possibility of exhaustion of the American cotton supply by next June, Senator Heflin,
of Alabama, asserted in the Senate
today that the present price of 26
cents a pound for middling cotton is
unjustified and too low.
In his talk, Senator Heflin asserted
the consumption figures showed “con
clusively that speculators have con
trol of the market and are depressing
prices.”
Senator Heflin further said that
“the law of supply and demand war
rants a price of 30 cents and more”
for middling cotton at this time.
BIG OIL DEAL IS
CONSUMMATED
Los Angeles Men Secure Blanket
Concession Covering Mexican
Oil Lands
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 23—A group
of Los Angeles men has obtained from
the Mexican government what will
amount to a blanket concession of all
government lands in the oil district
on the East Coast,” according to an
announcement from promoters published in the Los Angeles Times.
This is by far the biggest oil trans
action in Mexican history, says the
Times. “And probably the most im
portant deal of its kind in the world
for it involves 11,000,000 acres ad
joining rich workings in the Tampico
and Tuxpam districts.”
BEWARE OF WET
PROPAGANDA
Prohibition Commissioner Haynes
Declares Dry Law Will Be
Enforced
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.—“Be
good cheer” was Prohibition Com
missioner Haynes Christmas message
to “friends of the eighteenth amend
ment” in which he declares the suc
cess of prohibition enforcement gave
“every reason for hopefulness, grati
fication and congratulations.” “Do
not be deceived nor dismayed by the
nationwide program of misrepresen
tation of the constitution as it does
most pretentious and pernicious pro-
paganda to undermine enforcement
since the enactment of the eighteenth
amendment.”
POPE MAY CALL
CATHOLIC EPISCOPATE
Papal Encyclical Indicates Episcopacy May Meet In Rome
Jubilee Year
ROME, Dec. 23. —(By Associated
Press.) A probability that the Pope
will call a meeting of the entire Cath
olic Episcopacy in Rome during the
next jubilee year, is announced in
the Papal encyclical issued today.
Such a meeting would be a contin
uation of the Ecumenic council which
was held in Rome in 1870. In the
encyclical the Pontiff praises efforts at
universal pacification, but condemns
divorce, modern dances and immod
est fashions.

AMERICUS, GA., SATURDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 23, 1922.

SUPPLY NEAR EXHAUSTION

Today the Times-Recorder’s Empty
Stocking Fund closed, and with very
generous donations made by numerous citizens in all walks of life, and
kiddies throughout the territory serv
ed by this newspaper. The cash, thus,
secured will be divided tonight be
tween the Associated Charities and
the Salvation Army. The division will
be upon equal basis, except where
donors have otherwise indicated in
making donations.
Announcement was made Friday
that the largest donation to the
Empty Stocking Fund was contributed
by the Southern Printers, this being
an error. The contribution, which
was handed in by a messenger, was
that of the Americus Lions Club, of
which C. A. Ames, one of the owners
of the Southern Printers, is treas
urer. A misunderstanding of instruc
tions given verbally by the messenger
resulted in the contribution being
erroneously acknowledged, and cor
rection is gladly made in this issue.
Two little tots, Martha Marshall
and T. O. Marshall, Jr., contributed
$5.00 to the fund, and through a typo
graphical error the amount was pub-
lished as 50 cents, instead of the
larger amount, another error that is
gladly corrected today.
The largest single donation so far
to the fund was given by G. O. Lov
ing, who made his check read $10,
with the statement that if that was
not enough to make unhappy little
kiddies merry on Christmas morn,
there would be more forthcoming. He
has always been a generous contrib
utor to calls of this nature, but
the idea of a little child viewing an
empty stocking was too much for the
kindly heart of Oscar Loving.
The fund closed with a total of
$285.15 contributed.

On Streets This Year Because
Of Influenza
Christmas carols will not be sung
in Americus this year by the children
of the city schools, according to the

children to invite contagion.

in lieu of the carols that all Sunday
schools shall observe a 15 minute de-
votional to carols, and the following
songs should be included in the pro
gram.
“Silent Night,” “Hark the Herald
Angels Sing,” “O Come All Ye Faith
ful,” “Oh Little Town of Bethlehem,”
