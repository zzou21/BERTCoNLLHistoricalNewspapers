The MINES of ARIZONA

This department is under the di
rection of Mr. W. E. Defty, the
well known mining engineer, who
will carefully scrutinize all mat
ters relating to mining in order
that only reliable information re
garding legitimate enterprises
shall find a place here.
The Republican would be pleas
ed to receive information from
any part of the state regarding
the development of the mining in
dustry. All communications should
be addressed: Mining Department

Arizona Assay Office
A few months ago J. S. Neall, the
old and well established assayer of

1307 North First street, this city, sold
out his interests to F. W. Libbey, who
has conducted the office since that
time. A copartnership was formed
last week by the two assayers and

chemists mentioned and the business

will now be conducted under the firm

be presented at the technical sessions.
A special train has been arranged for
to carry eastern members from New
York on September 14. Other members
and their guests will join the party at
various points en route, and at El Paso,
Texas, the western section of the con
vening members, starting from Los An
geles, California, will meet the train
and continue to Arizona. The princi
pal towns in which the institute ses
sions or visits of inspection will be
held are Santa Rita and Hurley, N. M.,
and Douglas, Bisbee, Globe and Phoe
nix, Arizona. The inspections will in
clude the Roosevelt Dam and the mines
and works of practically all the lead
ing metal-producing companies of the
state. At Douglas, in the technical
sessions, the institute will discuss the
special subject of "Smelting." At Bis
bee papers will be read on "Mining and
Geology" and at Globe the first day
will be given over to "Mining and
Smelting" and "Leaching." During a
second day at Globe time has been set
aside for what is regarded as an im
portant discussion of "Concentration
and Flotation." The company plants
that will be visited are as follows: At
Hurley, the mines and works of the
Chino Copper Co.; at Bisbee and
Douglas, the mines and works of Cop

bing Concern in the United States

and the largest in the world.

Molybdenum
Molybdenum is a white metal, malle
able, ductile, and soft enough to be
filed with ease. However, it is seldom

produced in the pure state. Its melting-point
is in question, although the
U. S. bureau of standards places it at
2500 degrees C. or 4500 degrees F.,
which is 1400 degrees C. above the
melting-point of copper. Tungsten is
one of the few metals that have a
higher melting point. The appearance
of molybdenum varies with the method
of making it; reduction of the oxide or
sulphide by hydrogen yields molyb
denum as a grey powder which, under
heat and pressure, may be compacted
into a brittle metallic bar. When
drawn into wire, its tensile strength in
creases with the fineness of the wire.
In other words, as with copper and
tungsten, the more the metal is worked
the stronger it becomes.

Production of Sulphuric Acid In Ari
zona The acid used by the New Cornelia
Copper Co. at Ajo for the leaching of
oxidized copper ore will be furnished
from the Calumet & Arizona smelter
at Douglas, where it is a by-product of
the reduction of sulphide copper ore.
A large amount of lead was recently
bought for lining the leaching-vats.
Sulphuric acid of 9% strength will be
used to leach the ore crushed to one-quarter-inch
particles.

New Ore Body Has Been Opened Up
Official announcement of important

developments at the Magma property
reach the outside hardly before this
reaches press. We are reliably
informed that a new ore body has been
encountered which will add materially
to the company’s reserves.
Magma has an issued capitalization
of 240,000 shares, with a par value of
$5. In 1915 the company produced 6,
046,459 pounds of copper, on which net
profits of $611,729 were derived. These
profits were equal to $2.67 per share.
In the first half of this year Magma
produced 4,276,720 pounds of copper,
and showed net profits of $1,150,452,
which is equal to the annual rate of
$4.79 per share.
Recently Magma’s production has
been pushed to the annual rate of ap
proximately 10,000,000 pounds, and in
dications are that earnings this year
will be between $5.50 and $6 per share.
Magma is a high grade property, and
in the 1915 year the average cost of
producing copper was only 6.82c per
pound. The company has been low in
ore reserves, however. At the close of
1915, the official estimate of ore re
serves was 90,000 tons. The announce
ment expected in a few days will,
therefore, be particularly gratifying to
stockholders.

The sinking of the big new shaft

soon to be started by the Calumet &
Arizona Mining Company, at Bisbee,
Arizona, says Iron Ore, will permit
the more ready opening of a large
acreage of land in the territory as
yet little explored and that lies still
further down the great mineralized
valley beyond the Junction and Briggs
shafts. Here are the many claims
purchased from the American-Saginaw
Company as well as other lo
cated to the northwest of these.
Very little exploring work was done
on the American-Saginaw location.
One shaft was sunk in barren lime
stone and from this there were no
extensions in the way of drifts that
were valuable in determining the
mineral value of even this particular
locality. The ores of Bisbee are held
in the limestone pockets of varying
size being encountered as the lime
stones are cut into by shafts and
drifts. It is very easy to miss a de
posit, and all the valley is not ore,
it must be understood. The American-
Saginaw lands are certainly
very valuable and were bought
cheaply, as were all the holdings of
this company.

The Octave to Be Again Actively
Operated
According to J. Nelson Nevius in the
Bulletin of the Chamber of Mines and
Oil of Los Angeles, the Octave gold
mine, ten miles east of Congress Junc
tion, in the Walker district, will short
ly be a producer again. Past yields
to a depth of 2000 feet have been $2,
000,000. After erecting an expensive
electric power-plant at Wickenburg a
twelve-mile transmission line, and a
complete motor equipment at the mine,
the property was shut down some
years ago. The vein has recently

been opened beyond the fault for 270

feet, averaging 11 inches wide and
$10.06 per ton. The shoot is poor for
25 feet, followed by 90 feet of $13.44
ore across 4 feet. H. C. Gibbs of Bos
ton is president of the company.

Metal Prices
Copper maintains a high price 27
cents. The other metals have gained
strength during the week. So much
copper is sold far ahead, with probable
large sales in the near future, that its
resistance to a decline is explainable.
From the highest point during the cur
rent year to the present quotations,
following are the per cent reductions
in prices: aluminum, 89; copper, 13;

lead, 29; quicksilver, 75; silver, 12; tin,
33; and zinc, 60.

HAS A MINING RUSH

DOUGLAS, Sept. 2. There are indi
cations in the opinion of several local
mining men that an important lead

silver mine may be developed eight
miles east of Douglas, near Nigger
Head mountain. Since R. N. French,
a local attorney, staked out some
claims in that vicinity several months
ago under the belief that a shaft he
had discovered might be one of the
"lost mines" of the Mexicans, the
whole country in that vicinity has

been staked out.

THAT POSITIVELY OVERCOMES EVERYTHING EVER CONSIDERED A WEAKNESS OR A FAULT
IN A MINE CARBIDE LAMP.
The ITP Mine Carbide lamp requires no attention once it's charged and lighted. There are no wires which
must be jiggled, no screws which call for adjusting, nor valves of any kind which require regulating.
The flame burns as steadily as a jet of city gas, and requires no more attention than does an electric
bulb used to light your home or your office. There is never any flickering or ever a flare, the flame
remaining the same size until the last atom of carbide is used up.
Agitating or jarring will not affect the size of the flame; even a tumble will not cause sudden increase
in pressure or resultant increase in the size of the flame. This is the lamp which will meet your require
ment perfectly. We are State Distributors of this lamp and are in position to name you very attractive
prices. We can furnish you carbide in any quantity.

in unwatering the shaft and cleaning

up the workings before beginning on
the extraction of ore for shipment.
The mine is situated only a short
distance from Hereford, which will be

A Comparison
Arizona has a number of copper
mining companies, rivaling Michigan
in that respect, and contrasting with
the copper-mining industry in Mon
tana, Utah, Nevada, Alaska, and New
Mexico, where one or two large com
panies account for the bulk of the out
put. Of large mines Arizona has a full

share. It is scarcely necessary to men
tion the Copper Queen and Calumet &
Arizona at Bisbee, the Inspiration and
Miami at Miami, the Ray Consolidated
at Ray, the Old Dominion at Globe, the
United Verde at Jerome, the Arizona
Copper at Clifton, and the New Cor
nelia at Ajo. Among companies of
more moderate size are the Shattuck-
Arizona at Bisbee, the Consolidated
Arizona at Humboldt, the Arizona
Commercial and Iron Cap at Globe, the
Shannon at Metcalf, the Detroit Cop
per at Morenci, the Ray-Hercules at
Ray, the Magma at Superior, the
United Verde Extension at Jerome,
and several others less well known.
The Shattuck-Arizona Copper Co.,
which produced 11,154,211 pounds of
copper in 1915, makes occasional ship
ments of lead ore. The Magma Cop
per Co. produced 6,046,459 pounds of
copper last year from 59,219 tons of
ore, which is well over 100 pounds per
ton.
United States Mineral Production
The value of the mineral production
of the United States in 1915, accord
ing to preliminary figures compiled
by the U. S. Geological Survey, was
approximately $2,373,000,000, a gain of
$258,000,000, or more than 12% over
1914. The value for 1915 has been ex
ceeded but once—in 1913 when a to
tal of $2,439,000,000 was recorded.
The metallic products reached the
greatest value ever recorded, having
advanced from $691,000,000 in 1914 to
$987,500,000 in 1915—a gain of nearly
43%. The metals contributing most
largely to this increase, their combined
gains being 91% of the total, are as
follows: Pig iron, increase of $151,000,
000, or 34; copper, $89,930,000, or 59; and
zinc, $78,589,000, or 224.

The value of the non-metallic pro
ducts in 1915 has been exceeded in 1913
and 1914 only showing in 1915 a de
crease of less than 3 from the pre
ceding year. The figures for 1914 and
1915 are $1,423,000,000 and $1,385,000,-
000, respectively. The final figures for
the value of the non-metallic products
in 1916 may be somewhat increased
over the preliminary.

The mining activities and output re
ported for the six months just ended
show that 1916 promises to be a record-
breaking year in the value of mineral
products.

ORIGIN OF "PETRIFIED FOREST"
The "Petrified Forest" of Arizona,
really a series of petrified forests, lies
a short distance south of Adamana, on
the line of the Santa Fe railway.
There are four "forests," included in a
government reservation, "Petrified
Forest National Monument," created
by presidential proclamation in 1906.
The name "forest" is not strictly ap
propriate, for the petrified tree trunks
are all prostrate and are broken into
sections. The logs are the remains of
giant trees that grew in Triassic time,
the age of reptiles. The trees were of
several kinds, but most of them were
related to the Norfolk Island pine, now
used for indoor decoration. Doubtless
they grew in a near-by region and,
after falling, drifted down a water
course and lodged in some eddy or a
sand bank. Later they were buried by
sand and clay, finally to a depth of
several thousand feet. The conversion
to stone was effected by gradual re
placement of the woody material by
silica in the form called chalcedony,
deposited by underground water. A
small amount of iron oxides deposited
at the same time has given the bril
liant and beautiful brown, yellow, and
red tints which appear in much of the
material.
Some of the tree trunks are six feet
in diameter and more than 100 feet in
length. In the first forest there is a
fine trunk that forms a natural bridge
over a small ravine, the water having
first washed away the overlying clay
and sand and then, following a crevice,
worked out the channel underneath.
The length of this log is 110 feet, and
the diameter four feet at the butt and
one and a half feet at the top.
The petrified woods are beautiful
objects for study. When thin slices
are carefully ground down to a thick
ness of 0.003 inch or less and placed
under the microscope they show per
fectly the original wood structure, all
the cells being distinct, though now
they are replaced by chalcedony. By
studying the sections F. H. Knowlton of
the United States Geological Survey,
Department of the Interior, has found
that most of these araucarian trees
were of the species Araucarioxylon ari-
zonicum, a tree now extinct. It is
known to have lived at the same geolo
gic time also in the east-central part
of the United States, where the re
mains of some of its associates have
also been found. These included other
cone-bearing trees, tree ferns, cycads,
and gigantic horsetails, which indicate
that at that time, the rainfall was
abundant. U. S. Geological Survey.
