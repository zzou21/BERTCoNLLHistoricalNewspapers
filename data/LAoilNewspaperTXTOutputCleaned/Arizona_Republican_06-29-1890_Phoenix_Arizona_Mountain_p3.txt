THE MORMON SIDE.
AN INTERESTING LETTER BY B. F.
JOHNSON OF TEMPE.
A Complete Review of the History of
Mormonism From Its Inception Down
to Date by an Old Member.
To THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN: Will
you kindly give space for a few facts
with common sense, scripture and reason
in reply to your "Mormon as an
Issue?" I agree with you that all or
ganizations, social, moral, political and
religious, should like the tree be judged
by their fruits. But, sir, when you in
alluding to the Mormon church affirm
that its members while held in fellowship were stage robbers and criminals,
I deny the charge, for it is false. Those
who were tried on the "Wheeler robbery"
though "Found not guilty" have few
friends and no fellowship with us. But,
sir, suppose that grave charges could be
maintained against individuals of the
Mormon church, would that prove its principles false? If so, what about
the ancient church which produced a
Judas, an Ananias, and other members
guilty of great crimes. And did not its
founder say that the Gospel net gathered
both good and bad? And then in which
of all modern Christian churches are
there not found the dishonest and im
moral? And even among the preachers
those guilty of seduction and crime.
But these should be regarded as the
blight and not the true fruit by which
to judge the tree.
Now let us take a more general view
and note a few of the present fast ripen
ing fruits of that Christian colonization
which is the national boast, which is to
day so apparent and formidable through
out Christendom in its millions of
bayonets and broadswords, its Winchester
repeaters and colossal artillery,
its huge war ships afloat upon every sea
from all the nations called Christian,
while millions of Christian soldiery
upon land are drilling in the arts of war
to be the better qualified according to
the rules of civilization to shed each
others blood; and each Christian army
division with its paid chaplain or priest
to pray to the same God for the power
to kill each other, as was the case so
recently in our own Christian land, for
getting that their Christ had aid, "If
we are not one we are not
mine." And then let us look
into the crowded prisons, jails,
house of correction, "poor houses,
asylums, etc., throughout Christendom;
think of the world's great crime against
woman, who, deprived of marriage, are
filling nunneries, factories and sewing
garrcts by the million, faded, sick and
often half-starved all slaves to capital
and to the lust and cruelty of her brother
in it; politically below the negro physically worse treated than the female
brute; look into the gambling hells,
whisky dens, houses of assignation and
prostitution with all their damning
phases of abortion, infanticide and child
murder, to the lowest depths of pollu
tion, which, together with fearful dynamite and torch, with robbery, murder
and suicide fast increasing in every
Christian land; while, because of the
contradictions, strife and hatred among
Christian sects, with hireling priests
preaching for doctrine the precepts of
men, from which thinking people turn
in disgust and repudiate the Christian
Bible, owing to which infidelity, like a
mighty wave, is now making more converts than are all the Christian churches
together. All these things, transpiring
under the very shadow of gorgeous
churches and temples, endowed with
their millions and paying their priests a
salary greater than that of the President
of the United States. At the same
time the extremes of ignorance, poverty
and wretchedness, with all their fevering vices, on one cry hand are breeding
parasites upon honest labor; perpetuat
ing and increasing class distinction the
rich becoming richer and the poor
poorer and more desperate, until an
tagonism between capital and labor ap
pears almost ready for that grapple and
death struggle which prophets see and
all rulers fear must result in a general
collapse of your modern Christian
civilization, which civilization today,
Mr. Editor, we find so cruelly arrayed
by special legislation to rob, imprison,
disfranchise, and perhaps again exile or
exterminate, the Mormons. But who,
Mr. Editor, cannot see in their past
and present persecutions that it is
but history repeating itself. Only
a continuation of that intolerant hatred by which devout Catholic
Christians, with most excruciating tor
tures, put to death their fellow Chris
tians by the million under the sanction
of the law. In turn, the Protestants
persecute, burn and destroy the Cath
olics and each other in great numbers
until, in their zeal and frenzy, hungry
for carnage, they raised the cry "burn
the witches," which according to history, was not allayed until many
hundreds of thousands of innocent
people throughout Christian Europe
were barbarously burned at the stake,
and all this by good Christian law. And
by the same Christian civilization our
forefathers were persecuted for their re
ligion and tied on the Mayflower to save
their lives from other good Christians
who had power over them under the
law. And they, our Puritan fathers,
true to the fraternal zeal and cruelty,
persecuted and hung the Quakers,
burnt many innocent people as witches.
All this by their good Christian law,
for which crimes we, as their children,
blush in shame and regret. Even within my recollection of sixty five years

the Methodists now so numerous and
important were despised and derided as
a religious sect. But even those who
hate each other can now like Pilate and
Herod of old join hands with the impute
of all classes as in Utah, where the
priests and politician of every church
and party, with the blatant demagogue,
all join with the drunkard, gambler,
liar, thief and adulterer all unite in the
cry, "away with the horrid Mormons,
for they have no rights under the law
that we need respect." Again, what
has that kind of Christian civilization
accomplished among the heathen
by its missionary labors? Where
are the many powerful tribes and
millions of aboriginal inhabitants of
America? Wasted under the blighting
influence of the fatal fire-water and the
more deadly diseases attending their
conversion, until their names and places
are by the people forgotten. So also the
fair islands of the Western Archipelago
densely peopled when discovered but
now without one aboriginal inhabitant.
As also Polynesia with its 9,000,000 of
people fast dwindling from the same
cause. While the Sandwich Islands
within my recollection contained a pop
ulation of nearly 1,000,000 are now
dwindled to some 20,000 and they fast
decreasing through loathsome disease,
which has ever attended the
march of civilization among the heathen.
In truth did the Christ say "Ye comp
ass sea and land to make proselytes
which are three fold more than the
children of hell."
But having dwelt so long in review of
the fast ripening fruits of your modern
civilization I feel admonished to but
slightly note a few of the more excellent
fruits resulting from the union, self
sacrifice and missionary labor of the Mor
mon church as I have learned them
from a personal experience and careful
observation of sixty years.
I was born in the State of New
York in 1818 of the old puritanic stock.
My grandfather fell at Bunker's Hill,
and my forefathers were among the first
of liberty's sons to offer blood and
treasure "for the purchase of freedom,"
with right to think and speak. I was
raised a Presbyterian and early learned
to believe in God and reverence the
scriptures as his divine word. I was
taught to venerate the constitution as a
heaven inspired palladium of liberty
baptized in the blood of noble men and
women. And of my country's starry
Flag I was more than proud. Yet all
the same for sixty years I have been a
member of the Mormon church, and for
fifty years so near its front centre that
iniquity and crimes within the pales
of Mormon fellowship could not escape
my knowledge. From my early youth
to the day of his martyrdom I was inti
mately acquainted with the Prophet
Joseph Smith, and for years was his
business partner and trusted friend.
I knew him to be one of the
purest, truest, and noblest of all manly
men. His motto, like the humble
Nazarene's, "The poor shall have
the gospel preached to them," he
practically verified, and they came to
him by flocks. From 1832 to 1841, with
the mob of a thousand or two, he had
built the nourishing and prosperous
city of Kirtland, Ohio, had completed a
large and costly temple, and started in
dustries by which all were becoming
wealthy. Through religious and political jealousy and hate, persecutions were
increased, and the war-cry raised: " We
are the old citizens and won't be out
voted by Mormons." We were broken
up, receiving little or nothing for our
possessions, and fled, as best we could,
over 1000 miles to the Far West, Caldwell county, Mo. From Jackson county,
of the same State, and through the same
influence and popular cry, many hun
dreds were, in midwinter, by mob vio

lence, driven to the shelterless prairies,
their stores, printing presses, and prop
erty destroyed, ranches beaten and maimed,
others murdered. We remained in Cald
well, Davis and other counties until the
winter of 1838-39, when, through the
same prejudice and hate strengthened
by the envy and greed of those who
could not emulate our union and thrift,
with the intolerant cry, "The anti
slavery Yankee Mormons shall not
vote," reverberating throughout the
State until some 15,000 men, women,
and children of all ages and conditions,
many murdered, wives and daughters
ravished, prisons crowded with our lead
ers, all plundered and in great destitu
tion, under the exterminating order of
Governor Boggs, and by a military mob,
in midwinter, were driven from the
State. So fiendish and barbarous a cru
elty was never perpetrated by Pagan
nation. Making our way back under
terrible conditions, we were received
with long-to-be-remembered kindness by
the people of Illinois. While our leaders
were still in prison, we poor Mormons
rallied again on the future site of Nau
voo, Illinois, on the east bank of the
Mississippi. Here soon arose a more
prosperous, rich and beautiful city, with
a temple far more costly and grand. By
frugal industry, the poor had be
come rich in broad fields and pleasant
homes. Up to this period through all
of our past history there never was a
Mormon whiskey saloon, a gambling
hell, a house of ill-fame, a public courte
san, or a pauper. The criminal docket
of our city and county were familiar
with the names only of our enemies.
And now, Mr. Editor, mark you, al
though we had so often been robbed of
all, driven homeless, naked, hungry,
and sick, amid deep snows and mud to
encounter the piercing winds and sleet
through stormy and pitiless winters;
many murdered in cold blood, hundreds
died of exposure and fatigue; women
ravished; leaders in prison offered hu
man flesh for food. All this, Mr. Edi
tor, transpired in our history before
there were any plural marriages; before
endowment oaths, and other Mormon
horrors were begotten in the imagina
tion of our enemies. Plural marriage,
although understood and accepted by
the few, was not a published and ac
cepted doctrine of the church until 1852,
nor were endowments until after the
murder of our prophet. And yet in the
past we were more relentlessly and cru
elly persecuted than at the present.
But to return: Nauvoo was now a rich
and flourishing city of 20,000 inhabi
tants "Too good for the damned Mor
mons." Our thrift and increasing num
bers aroused jealousy, which, stimu
lated by envy and greed, boiled up to a
deadly hate. Politicians who could not
rule went in for our ruin. All joined in
the old cry: "We are the old citizens
and the Mormons must go." Arrested,
and promised, upon the honor of the
State by the Governor, protection,
Joseph and Hyrum Smith were taken
to Carthage for trial, at which place in
June, 1844, they were murdered in cold
blood. After enduring all manner of
persecutions injustice, and insult until
the winter of 1846-47, when of all ages
and conditions by thousands we crossed
the Mississippi upon the ice, having
been routed from homes of comfort to flee we knew not
where. Our prophet murdered, our
temple burned, again robbed of all but
our lives and of each other we gladly
followed our great leader, Brigham
Young, into the trackless wilds of the
then "Great American Desert" with
every apparent prospect of perishing by
starvation and exposure, or by the
bloody tomahawk. Driven to encounter
the storms of that fearful winter, exiled
from our native land, compelled to seek
homes upon Mexican soil, yet we were

not forgotten by our enemies in that we
were followed into western Iowa with a
demand obtained from the Government
for 500 of our young men to leave their
wives or aged parents, and under com
mand of Colonel Cook, to make forced
marches by way of Santa Fe, Tucson
and Gila River to Los Angeles, Cal.
This march was performed only through
the greatest privation and heroism
known to American warfare. The fruits
of that unparalleled Mormon patriotism
is the homes we enjoy in Arizona, Cali
fornia and Utah. Being mustered out
of service at Los Angeles in the same
fall, many hastened to upper California
where, at San Francisco, they met the
ship Brooklyn, from Boston, freighted
with Mormon emigrants, who brought
the first printing press to the Pacific
Coast. Lyman Green, of my personal
acquaintance, while at work for Marshall on the Sutter millrace, was the
first to see and collect nuggets of gold,
and call to them the attention of others.
He was the real discoverer of California
gold. For more than one thousand
miles of trackless desert wilds and
mountain gorges, surrounded by bar
barous Indian tribes, we "built the
bridges and killed the snakes," marking
our toilsome and weary way with the
graves of hundreds of our loved ones.
Our pioneers arrived on the present site
of Salt Lake City July 24, 1847, and had
the satisfaction to know that we were
the first and consequently the oldest
settlers. With an eye to our country's
still greater future we carefully noted
the possibilities and facilities for
a transcontinental railroad and
as early as 1850 we called the attention
of Congress, by memorial of our Legislative Assembly of the Territory
of Utah, to the feasibility of
the present overland route.
And while from 1847 all the world
seemed mad for California gold we re
mained at home exploring for life facili
ties in the then unexplored mountains;
pioneering out to Americans the new
method of agriculture by irrigation. For
years from arduous and unequalled war
fare with the mountain locust and
cricket we were kept on the borders of
starvation, while all this time we had
hostile Indians to feed or fight, and
sometimes both. We endured the test,
brought success out of terrible adversity,
learned to make beautiful homes in bar
ren wastes, and made the desert bloom
and ripen in abundance the choicest
fruits. At the same time in self sacrifice
and for the love of their religion our
heroic and tireless missionaries were in
all parts of the world with the gospel to
preach to the poor. Soon converts from
every land came flocking to Utah.
Hitherto they had never owned a
shelter or a spot of land in which to be
buried. Now they found preparations
for their sustenance in Utah and for
future independence. The poor were
assisted, the ignorant taught. Today
there are many thousands of freeholders
in Utah who came from this class, and
are the most wealthy and substantial
citizens. The "soiled doves" of modern
civilization for whom society has no
further use or place, left to be kicked
down the slimy way to perdition, even
they have been taught to moult their
feathers in reform and to reclaim them
selves in virtue, and now are happy
wives and mothers. Not until carpet
bag Federal officers were forced upon
us to open the avenues of debauchery to
the Mormon youth, which has been
their avowed object, was there any pub
lic enticement to immorality in all the
cities of Utah. But now oh, how changed!
Our enemies not satisfied that we
had so often been robbed, spoiled and
exiled in the past, now find the easy
conveyance in less days than it took us
weary Mormons in coming to Salt Lake,
where they now find the Mormons a
"survival of the fittest," enjoying a de

lightful country and climate with rich
and beautiful cities and palatial homes.
All too good for the Mormons; just good
enough for themselves. So what can be
done? A few political vampires not
wanted in the East, with empty grip
sacks and no business; and preachers
from the different sects sent to convert
the corrupt Mormons, whose women
they found able to teach them in Bible
theology; with the missionary Federal
officers; the transient and mining opu
lation, all join in a general conspiracy
to rule or ruin the Mormons. Through
the press, from pulpit and platform,
they seek to inflame the prejudices of
the masses by base misrepresentation
and foul falsehoods concerning Mormon
minders, endowment oaths, Danites,
etc., etc., all of which are untrue, but
through whose influence Congress has
been cajoled and by special act has dis
incorporated the Mormon church; has
confiscated to the government some
million or more of its property, and now
has before it a bill to disfranchise all
Mormons, and thereby to give us, the
pioneers and first settlers of the moun
tain and coast region of the great South
west, to the spoliation of our enemies
once more; to give to more than eighty
per cent of Utah's people, nearly all of
whom are native born, the privilege of
being wholly governed by and to pay
taxes to, the less than twenty per cent
of the people all of whom are our
enemies.
Plural marriage we accept from neces
sity and duty as a cure for your civili
zation's great crime against women, a
stay to the great
social evil. All
else of which
is false. Virtue
among Mormons is the life
line, and infidelity to the marriage vow is death to fellow
ship. With us there were no un
married women, and a bachelor of thirty
was a nuisance in society. Federal
officers and transients complained bit
terly that with no single women and no
courtesans it was rather hard on them
in Utah. You say plural marriage is a
crime against the law. But who made
it so? You talk pompously of your
Christianity being adverse and antag
onistic to plural marriage. Now if your
modern Christianity did not come from
and through the Hebrew or Christian
Bible whence is it? The Hebrew Bible
with its Christ was every whit conceived
in and born of plural marriage. It is
the offspring and spawn of polygamy.
And now, Mr. Editor, what will your
dear sanctimonious Christians do who
now hold up their hands in holy horror
and howl about Mormon polygamy, yet
pray so devoutly to be permitted in
Heaven to sit down with Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, and the twelve patri
archs whose names are to adorn the
twelve gates of the New Jerusalem, to
sing the songs of Moses and the Lamb,
with the psalms of David and Solomon,
they forget that these were polygamists
or sons of plural marriage. What will
your sanctimonious Christians do in such
a criminal and barbarous gathering if
they have no United States Marshals
and deputies and bracelets along to
serve them as they do the poor Mormons
for following their example? But fie
upon such Pharisaic hypocrisy. Who
does not know that plural marriage
came all the way with the Bible, and
that our Christ whom they worship
chose the lineage of polygamy through
which to be born and that monogamy,
the one-wife law, came; Christendom
through the heathen, having its incep
tion in the foundation of Rome by the
outlaws and brigands from the Grecian
states, who having no wives committed
the Sabine rape to obtain them, and
from necessity enacted a one-wife law.
All Christian Europe being subdivisions
of the Roman Empire, resulted in the
entailment of the one-wife law. Owing
to which, together with your colossal
armies, millions of otherwise pure and
lovely women deprived of protection by
marriage, through poverty or otherwise,
become slaves to the selfishness, lust
and brutality of man, pander to all his
vices, and are sinking with him to social
conditions which rival Sodom of old.
Again, let us look at Utah with her
80 per cent of Mormons. Upon the re
maining 20 percent our enemies rests
60 per cent of the crime, and 10 per cent
of the crime upon the 80 per cent of
Mormons. Now there is more drunk
enness, debauchery and crime in a day
than was previously known to have
been committed in a term of years.
Let us now consider the burlesque
perpetrated upon reason by the grave
judges of the Supreme Court of the
United States in the church robbery
case, in which the court affirms that
polygamy and absolute ecclesiastical
control of its members were the dis
tinguishing features of Mormonism,
neither of which charges is true. There
is no organized Christian community on
earth so perfectly guided by their own
consciousness of what is right, and so
free from priestly rule, as are the Mormons. And not 5 per cent of the Mormons have plural wives. When enter
ing the church the question is not
raised as to a belief in polygamy. No
one, however, is received as a member
who does not practically subscribe to
the doctrine of faith in God, repentance,
baptism by immersion for remission of
sins, laying on of hands, atonement, the
resurrection of the dead, Joseph Smith
as a prophet, divinity of the Book of
Mormon, etc. These are and al
ways have been the cardinal doc
trines of the Mormon Church
and are the features for which we have
been so persecuted in the past.
And then think of the ignorance or
party animosity of a learned United
States Judge, who would so caricature
reason as to draw plural marriage on a
parallel as equal in crime with murder,
while with Bible in hand he reads that
marriage was the command of God upon
all through which to produce human
life, and that murder to take
human life was the greatest
of all human crimes. One the
antipode of the other in God's com
mand. Does it look honest in judges
and preachers who teach from the Bible
to call polygamy adultery, while Moses,
who was forty days in the presence of
God and received the law that made
death the penalty for adultery, was him
self at the same time a polygamist?
Oh! how blessed is the Christian Bible
when shut, but so vulgar and criminal
when read and practically adopted!
But, Mr. Editor, do not for a moment
fancy that I am seeking to convert you
to plural marriage, for it is the last
principle we teach from the fact that it
is only the morally pure who are worthy
of one wife, and so very few that should
be trusted with more. And then, as
there is now, a United States statute
making it criminal, we believe, in "ren
dering to Caesar according to the law"
as it is, and waiting with fullest confi
dence for the "survival of the fittest"
and for evolutions in the near future,
through which the now despised prin
ciples of our religion will become the
solar centre of life and light to all the
organized systems for the government
of man upon the earth.
This is a purpose of the great Jehovah,
and his arm will bring it to pass.
