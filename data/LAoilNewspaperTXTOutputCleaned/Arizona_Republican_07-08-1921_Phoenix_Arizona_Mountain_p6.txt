CONVICTED MOTOR
CAR THIEF DRAWS
MAXIMUM
SENTENCE

Joe Clark, convicted by a jury of
grand larceny and believed by officers
to be the ring leader of a band of
auto thieves, drew the maximum sen
tence provided by law when he ap
peared before Judge R. C. Stanford
for sentence yesterday morning. His
previous record influenced the sen
tence, Judge Stanford announced.
The court pronounced an indetermi
nate sentence of from 9 to 10 years on
Clark. Ten years is the maximum
sentence for this charge provided by
law. Under the Arizona statutes, an
indeterminate sentence must be pro
nounced by the court.
Clark was convicted of stealing an
automobile in Phoenix and of dispos
ing of it in Prescott. Officers who
worked on the case declare that Clark
headed one of the biggest gangs of
auto thieves in the entire state. His
arrest, they believe, has broken the
backbone of the "industry."
Clark had previously served two
prison sentences, according to infor
mation placed before the court by
the county attorney's office. He first
was sentenced in Montana for a fel
ony and was later taken before a
federal court in Nevada and sen
tenced to 19 years in the federal peni
tentiary at McNeill's island.

AUTO CLUB TO SHIP
CARS FOR MEMBERS

A new departure along the lines of
service and one which will result not
only in definite assistance to auto
mobile owners but in material sav
ings as well in all cases where motor
ists intend to ship their cars away,
was announced yesterday by the Ariz
ona Automobile club through its presi
dent and general manager, S. J. Ross.
This service is to take care of all
cars to be shipped without expense
to owners except in the matter of
freight, and in this the club is able
to effect a material reduction when
cars are shipped in carload lots.
Under the new plan all that an
automobile owner must do in ship
ping his car is to leave it with the
Arizona Automobile club and pay the
freight charges. The club will at
tend to all the details of shipment,
and in cases where owners are willing
to wait until a carload shipment can
be made up, which means when three
cars can be shipped together, the
saving in cost will approximate 25 per
cent. There will also be a definite
cut in the cost of blocking, etc. Fur
ther information concerning the plan
may be obtained by telephoning to
Ross at the chamber of commerce.

Four Jurors Take
Seats In Chicago
Baseball Hearing
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
CHICAGO, July 7 Some of the
greatest stars in baseball, including
Ty Cobb, manager of the Detroit
Americans; Eddie Collins, captain of
the Chicago White Sox, and half a
dozen other Detroit players may be
called to testify in defense of the
White Sox players and others on trial
here. This was made known by the
defense today in accepting the first
four jurors. As Henry Berger, de
fense attorney, finished examining
the fourth juror, he asked if he knew
any of the witnesses announced by
the state and then said: "Do you
know Ty Cobb, Harry Heilmann,
Veatch, Young, Bill James, Owen Bush,
Howard Ehmke, Oscar Stanage, Dayer,
Dauss or Mitchell of the Detroit
club, or Eddie Collins, John Collins,
Red Faber, Birdie Ryan, Harry Lemboid,
Eddie Murphy or Clarence Rowland who are now with or formerly
were with the White Sox?"
Later Mr. Berger said these men
might testify as to the character of
the indicted players, render opinions
as to the possibility of a game being
thrown, or about the pennant win-
ning drive of the White Sox at the
close of the 1919 series in which a
number of games were won by De
troit. The fourth juror to be chosen
was Stephen Suben, a machinist. He
is married and is 42 years old. The
other jurors sworn in with him fol
low:
Paul Luepcke, 38, married, tele
phone company employe.
Herbert Jordan, stationary engineer,
41, married.
Joseph Vesley, 41, married, foreman
of a motor company.
Statements by defense attorneys
during examination of prospective
jurors in the baseball trial that the
indicted White Sox players were not
high salaried men, as had been sup
posed, resulted in the state making
public a list of salaries which in
cluded figures as low as $3000 per
season for some of the men and as
high as $7250 for others.
The list, as given out by the state,
follows:
Chick Gandil, $1666.66 per month for
the playing season of six months in
1919.
Charles Risberg, $3250 for the 1919
season plus $183.76 for the extra
time required for the world series.
Buck Weaver, $7250 for 1919, plus
$1198.56 for world series period.
Fred McMullin, $500 per month for
season of about six months, plus
$149.94 for world series period. $80
per month for 1920.
Joe Jackson, $1000 per playing sea
son month in 1919, plus $299.97 for
world series period.
Oscar Felsch, $714.50 per month
in 1919, plus $214.38 for world series
period. Given a bonus of $3000 after
1919 series and $1500 per season
contract for 1920.
Claude Williams, $300 per month
in 1919, plus a bonus of $375 in ac
cordance with his contract, and an
other bonus said to have been given
voluntarily by Charles A. Comiskey.
Contract for 1920 season, $3000.
Edward Cicotte, $952 per month in
1919 season, plus $3000 bonus after
1919 series, plus $285.75 for series
period.

over," you can see for yourself.

Oldest Automobile In World, Built In
1891, As It Entered Paris Recently,

Abbe Gavois of Rainville, France, caused quite a sensation in Paris re
cently when he drove what is believed to be the oldest motor car in the
world down the Champs Elysees and the boulevards. The car, built in 1891,
has traveled many thousand miles and can still do twelve miles an hour un
der favorable conditions. Abbe Gavois drove the car to Paris to dispose
of it to the highest bidder, the proceeds to be given to Relief of the Picardy
Chaplains wounded in the world war.

OIL FINDING
INSTRUMENT
PROVES LOCAL
FIELD

Information of exceeding interest pert
aining to the accuracy of the oil finding
instrument which located the oil field west
of Litchfield, has just been received by A.
W. Fisher.

It was through Mr. Fisher's efforts that
G. C. Wucherer came here several months
ago and discovered and outlined what he
claimed was the richest oil pool he had ever
found, and as his experience covered the
great oil producing states of California and
Texas such a statement on his part produced
a marked effect upon those who hoped for a
favorable report from this man.
Soon after this, a syndicate was organized
in Los Angeles to drill a well on territory
which the Wucherer instrument located and
which the geologists of the big oil companies
of California pronounced dry and worthless
and without the shadow of a prospect for
oil. In other words, this was to be a test to
determine the reliability and accuracy of
the instrument. Furthermore the ground
selected had been drilled up to within a few
thousand feet and had been a failure and
therefore the location of a pool right close
to what had been dry ground made the test
doubly valuable.
Work has been in progress for several
months, during which time the big oil com
panies have watched the operations with
considerable interest. Yesterday Mr. Fisher
received a telegram from Los Angeles an
nouncing that the oil sand had been struck
and that the well gave promise of being a
big gusher. The water is now being cement
ed off and then the sand will be penetrated
and the well brought in. The Standard and
Union companies are now frantically after
the territory surrounding the lease on which
the big well has been drilled.
The importance to Phoenix and the Salt
River Valley, of this information, is that the
oil field west of Litchfield and covering
practically the whole north half of the White
Tank mountains was discovered by the same
instrument, and the whole pool accurately
outlined, making the drilling of a successful
and producing well a certainty. And in
view of the fact that this pool in the White
Tanks is the richest that the instrument has
ever recorded, it brings elation to those who
are giving their time and money to the de
velopment of the well there.
It was the discovery made by the scien
tific instruments that enlisted the attention
of Alexander McKenzie in the pool at the
White Tanks and where it was his intention
to drill a well, when unfortunately he had a
break down that compelled his withdrawal
from all business activity, transferring his
land on which the well had been located,
together with buildings, water well, etc., to
Mr. Fisher who in turn transferred it to the
Carter Oil & Gas Company in consideration
of said company moving their drilling
equipment to the McKenzie holding, and
which is now under way. Stockholders of
the Carter Company will be pleased to learn
of the success of the oil finding instrument
as it establishes without doubt a pool at the
White Tanks.
