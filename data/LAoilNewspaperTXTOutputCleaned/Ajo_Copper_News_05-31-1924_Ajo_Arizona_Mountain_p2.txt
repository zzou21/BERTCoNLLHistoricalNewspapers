DENTIST LIKES AJO—
Dr. P. C. McIntosh, the new dentist
who with his wife came to Ajo from
Winslow about a month ago to make
his home here, is well pleased.
He has been quite busy, and expects the camp to be fair through
the summer and very good in the
coming fall and winter. It requires
some little time, he says, to get acquainted and re-establish in a new
town, but all things considered he
is quite satisfied so far. “A payroll
of 1000 men is bound to make a good
camp,” said Dr. McIntosh. “There
are plenty of towns and mining
camps in Arizona that would be
very glad to have such a payroll.”
In this connection, he took occasion
to praise Copper News.
Dr. T. U. Morgan, a Kansas City
dentist friend of Dr. McIntosh, is
here on a visit with the latter and
plans becoming associated with him
at Ajo in the coming fall.
The new dentist not only came
highly recommended, but his work
so far is well spoken of by those to
whom he has rendered professional
services at his office over the post
office.

MUST HAVE COPPER NEWS—
“Am going away from home for
about a month. Must have Copper
News while I am gone. Haven’t
missed buying a copy but once or
twice, I guess, in the five years I
have lived at Ajo.”
So said C. H. Falk Thursday, when
he subscribed for this paper to be
mailed to him at Palomas Hot
Springs, N. M., which is but a few
miles from the Elephant Butte dam.

AJO WEATHER THE PAST WEEK
The weather continues dry and,
for the time of year, unusually cool.
If the prediction of the Papago
Indians comes true, however, we shall
have a hot summer, with but little
rain. They go by a number of signs
including the color of the flowers of
the cactus. “All bunk,” you say
—wait and see, perhaps the Indians
are right. (Trains are running daily
—don’t start for the Coast until
the hot weather actually comes.

AJO COPPER NEWS

FIESTA GIVEN SUNDAY
ACROSS THE BORDER
R. H. Bartlett of Ajo gave a
fiesta Saturday and Sunday at
Sonoyta, just across the Mexican
border, about 40 miles from Ajo.
On the program were a bull fight,
games, horse races, barbecue, and
dancing to good music.
Quite a number of people motored
down from Ajo Sunday and report
a good time, the barbecued meat
being especially fine.
Sonoyta is a beautiful spot, with
plenty of shade and vegetation, quite
a large stream of water—the
Sonoyta river—running through the
town. And the road, while not a
highway, is fair, considering the
time of year and the traffic.
Some farming is carried on in
the vicinity, but not a great deal,
because the Mexicans are not provided with farm implements. “Lupe”
has a small truck garden, and expects to have watermelons and
cantaloupes for the Ajo market
about the 4th of July. Mr. Bedoya
has what is perhaps the best orchard
in the vicinity, having quite a number of grape vines bearing. There
are also a number of fig trees
close to the river, and some other
fruits are raised in season.

COUNTY TAXES
The second installment of county
taxes will be payable throughout
the month of May.
CHARLES H. DODGE,
May 5, 17, 24, 31 Treasurer.

IMPORTANT TO EX-SERVICE MEN
Any ex-service men in Ajo who
have lost their discharge can obtain blank applications for “Certificates in Lieu of Lost Discharge”
from R. A. McKelvey, who has a
limited number on hand.
It is important that those who
have lost their discharge and wish
to avail themselves of the Adjusted
Compensation law have such certificate.

For Constable
I hereby announce my candidacy
for the office of Constable of the
precinct, subject to the Republican
primary Sept. 9, 1924. I will appreciate the votes and support of
all those participating in this election.
JOE REEL.
Ajo, Ariz., May 23, 1924.
