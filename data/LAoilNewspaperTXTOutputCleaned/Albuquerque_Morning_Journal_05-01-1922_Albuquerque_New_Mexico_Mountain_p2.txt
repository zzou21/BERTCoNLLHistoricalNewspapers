FALL FROM EIGHTH
STORY FATAL

Mrs. Rose Grainger, Mother
of Composer and Pianist,
Plunges to Her Death
From a Window.
(By The Associated Press.)
New York, April 30. Mrs. Rose
Grainger of White Plains, N. Y.,
mother of Percy A. Grainger, the
Australian composer and pianist,
was killed today by a fall from an
eighteenth-story window in the
Aeolian Hall building. Word was
immediately sent to the son, who is
said to be in Los Angeles on a concert
tour.
Mrs. Grainger, who was 60 years
old and wealthy, was spending the
day with Mrs. Antonia Sawyer in
Aeolian Hall.
Mrs. Sawyer, who said she was
Terry Grainger's manager, told the
police that Mrs. Grainger tele
phoned her from White Plains that
she was not well and asked permission
to visit her. Mrs. Sawyer
motored out to White Plains after
her.
Shortly after their arrival at the
Sawyer suite, Mrs. Grainger asked
for medicine and Mrs. Sawyer
stepped out to obtain it. When
she returned her guest was missing.
She discovered her body on the
roof of an adjoining building, thirteen
stories below. Mrs. Grainger
was dead when she reached the
hospital.
Mrs. Grainger was the widow of
John H. Grainger, an engineer and
architect. Before her marriage she
was a music teacher and her son
received his first instructions from
her. She came to the United
States about two years ago.
Benjamin M. Vance, assistant
medical director later announced
that his office had registered Mrs.
Grainger's death as due to suicide.

GRAINGER IS ADVISED
AFTER HIS CONCERT
Los Angeles, Calif., April 30.
News of the death in New York
of Mrs. Rose Grainger, mother of
Percy A. Grainger, reached Los
Angeles this afternoon while the
Australian composer and pianist
was conducting a concert of his
compositions by the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra.
He was not notified of the accident
which cost his mother's life
until after the concert, when he
paid he would leave immediately
for New York. He had only one
more concert before June. That
was here tomorrow and was canceled
immediately.

EARLY POLITICAL GARDENING
BEING DONE IN MOST STATES;
PARTY LEADERS ARE ACTIVE

Indiana Opens the Season Tuesday Where
Beveridge Will Attempt to Obtain the
Nomination for the Seat
Congress May Adjourn
Mondell.

Held By New;
June, Says

in

(By The Associated Press.)
Washington, April 30. The
beginnings of the party primary season,
giving promise of unusual features
for an "off year," already are
turning the fancies of official
Washington to thoughts of politics.
Amid abundant signs of an
"early spring," politically speaking,
the titular leaders of the great
parties once more are diligently at
work. Their efforts center in the
national capital, but field reports
indicate that early political gardening
also is the order virtually
every state.
President Harding has said that
he intends to take no active part
in the campaign, but members of
Congress are more restless. In
more than one district "back
home" fence mending has become
a question of prime necessity.
The entire membership of the
House, thirty-four senators and
thirty-four governors of states are
to be elected next November. In
all but six of the states candidates
must run the gauntlet of a primary
election and the long series of
primaries just beginning is credited
with responsibility for the
present unseasonable activity of
the party chiefs.
For the present Indiana holds
the spotlight, principally because
its primary of next Tuesday will
decide whether Senator New or
former Senator Beveridge, a one
time leader of the Roosevelt progressives,
is to be the Republican
nominee for senator.
Among the later primary elections,
national party leaders find
their greatest interest in North
Dakota, where on June 28 Senator
McCumber, chairman of the Senate
finance committee, will measure
strength with former Senator
Gronna for the Republican senatorial
nomination; in Missouri
which on August 1 will decide
whether Senator Reed, a Democratic
storm petrel of three administrations,
is to be renominated; in
President Harding's home state of
Ohio, and California and Wisconsin,
where Senators Johnson and
LaFollette respectively, are asking
for Republican nominations.
The list of primary dates as
fixed by law includes:
May 1, Oregon.
June 6, Iowa; 19, Minnesota; 28,
North Dakota.
July 18, Nebraska; 22, Texas
(preliminary),
August 1, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma;
22, Wyoming; 26, Texas
(final); 29, California, Montana.
September 6, Nevada; 12, Arizona,
Colorado, Washington; 19,
New York.
Idaho will nominate August 22,
but by the old-fashioned convention
system. Conventions also are
to be held in New Mexico and Utah.
How soon Congress might adjourn
the question uppermost
now in the thoughts of members
still is in the air.
Replying to inquiries Representative
Mondell, Wyoming, the
Republican leader, said today he
was hopeful the end might be
reached around June 1.
Asked as to the probability of
three-day recesses during May in
event adjournment June 1 was unlikely,
Mr. Mondell said the business
of the House "may not be
pressing after the middle of May."

ESTEBAN GUTIERREZ
OF SPRINGER IS DEAD
(Special Correspondence to The Journal.)
Las Vegas, N. M., April 30.
News has been received here of

ago of Esteban Gutierrez. Mr.
Gutierrez was town marshal for
the town of Las Vegas several
years ago. In 1917 he went to
Springer to act as a guard at the
state reform school. Recently he
has been conducting a store at
Springer. Mr. Gutierrez has several
relatives in Las Vegas.

TO TEACH MASSAGING,
MANICURING AND HAIR
DRESSING IN SCHOOL
(By The Associated Press.)
Los Angeles, Calif., April 30
(by the Associated Press). A
public school where manicuring,
massaging and hair dressing will
be taught for what is believed to
be the first time such subjects
have been offered as a part of
state education, without tuition
charges, will be included in the
curriculum of the Grand Avenue
school here next September.
The plans of the school authorities
here call for the conversion
of the school from an ordinary
grade school to a home for the
huge department of part-time instruction
that now offers practical
work in many manual arts
to more than 2,600 enrolled students.
The enrollment is composed
of boys and girls who are
not exempt from the requirements
of the law that they attend
school and yet must have their
time for labor because they
are either self-dependent or must
help others.

About the Circulation
of Air In Genuine
LEONARD
Refrigerators

BY THE INVENTOR

The great success and popularity of Leonard Refrigerators
is based on correct engineering principles which involve the
famous Leonard air circulation, and a uniformly high standard
of construction. The system consists of such an arrangement
of air passages, flues and ice rack as to expose the
largest possible cooling surface to the air in the ice
chamber, causing it to condense and settle down on
provisions below, as cold air is heavier than warm
air. And by the same principle the warm air is
forced upward and around the ice, causing the famous
Leonard air circulation to take place. This
continues as long as there is ice in the ice chamber.
Leonard refrigerators are built as good as refrigerators
can be built. This fine construction not
only makes the Leonard last longer than ordinary
refrigerators, but brings about an economy of ice
through its perfect insulation.
Leonards come from cottage to hotel size.

SAFETY FIRST DRIVE
TO BE CONDUCTED BY
ALL CLASS 1 RAILWAYS

(By The Associated Press.)
Topeka, Kans., April 30. A
safety first campaign of national
scope will be conducted for four
months beginning June 1 and continuing
until October 1, by all
Class 1 railroads in the United
States through the American Railway
Association, it has been announced
here by Isaiah Hale,
safety superintendent of the Santa
Fe and chairman of the Information
committee of the campaign.
The safety first drive will be
known as the "Careful Crossing
Campaign" and will have for its
chief purpose the reduction of accidents
at railroad crossings.
Posters bearing the slogan "Cross
Crossings Cautiously" will play an
important part in the campaign,
according to Mr. Hale. It is proposed
to furnish each railroad
with ten posters for every mile of
track in the system.

Civic organizations in all parts
of the country will be asked to assist
in the drive as well as other
transportation companies, including
electric railways, motor and
bus lines. Mr. Hale said.
Complete plans for the campaign
have not been worked out.
he reported, but will be agreed
upon at the annual convention of
the safety section of the American
Railway Association in Chicago,
May 2, 3 and 4.

PREACHER AND OTHERS
GO INTO TRANCES AT
REVIVAL AT ARTESIA
(Special Correspondence to The Journal.)
Artesia, N. M., April 30.
Scores of people have been unable
to gain admittance into the
building, where Rev. Bates, of
Portales, and Rev. Perkins, of
Mountainair, are conducting a
revival meeting. Rev. Bates does
the preaching and Rev. Perkins
leads in the song services. These
men are assisted by many persons
of the same faith, from Portales
and Artesia. The denomination
is known as the Assembly of
God, or the Pentecostal church.
They advocate divine healing,
baptism of the Holy Spirit, and
speak in a supernatural tongue.
The Glover building would not
accommodate the great crowds
who desired admittance. The
Richards building, with a seating
capacity of several hundred
has been secured. It is also crowded
every night.
The preacher and others of this
belief go into trances at each
service. They talk in an unknown
tongue, which they claim is a
supernatural power from God.
While under this power, they
will often dance for joy about
the building for long periods of
time. Some of the members will
go into trances and lay for hours
without moving. These peculiar
actions create much curiosity
from the citizens of the town.
Local persons are being converted
to this form of religion. The
meeting has been conducted for
three weeks and will continue indefinitely,
according to announcements.

WIFE ACCUSES NOTED WOMAN ALIENIST
OF LOVE PLOT TO DECLARE HER INSANE

Above, Mrs. Emmanuel H. Kuttner;
Dr. Florence Fowler, below.

(By Central Press.)
Chicago, April 30. Does Mrs.
Emmanuel H. Kuttner think that
she is the reincarnation of the
Queen of Sheba?
Is Emmanuel H. Kuttner engaged
in a plot with Dr. Florence
Fowler to railroad Mrs. Kuttner
into a madhouse?

A Chicago court will have to decide
these questions when the divorce-alienation
suit of Mrs. Kuttner
comes to trial.

In her complaint Mrs. Kuttner
charges that her husband, Emmanuel
H. Kuttner, secretary of
the Illinois Ballast and Improvement
company, and Dr. Fowler,
chief of the psychopathic division
of the Cook county hospital, are
attempting to have her adjudged insane.

Dr. Fowler replies that Mrs.
Kuttner has an obsession that she
is the Queen of Sheba.
Mrs. Kuttner further alleges
that her husband established Dr.
Fowler in a "port of love" and later
brought her to their goat and
poultry farm so the alienist could
gather evidence to send her, his
wife, to an asylum.
"I became suspicious when he began
to bring Dr. Fowler here," Mrs.
Kuttner said. "and when they continued
coming I got out an injunction
to restrain them. They lined
to make love on the goat farm be-
fore I employed guards to keep
them away. This adjoins my bungalow."
Dr. Fowler declares that the
charges come from a somewhat irresponsible
devotee of psychic
fads.
"She is a student of spiritism,
Mohammedanism, occult sciences
and new thought," Dr. Fowler
said. "She once boasted to me
that she was the reincarnation of
the Queen of Sheba. She got the
idea that Kuttner and I were keeping
company from one of her
seances."
The Kuttners have been married
eighteen years.

POSTOFFICE CLERK'S
GRADE IS 99 PER CENT
(Special Correspondence to The Journal.)
Las Vegas, N. M., April 30.
Fred C. Lewis, clerk in the East
Las Vegas post office, made a grade
of 99 per cent in the recent examination
in routing mail matter.
Lewis' mark was the best made.
The examination consists in throwing
800 cards bearing names of
post office towns, into the proper
boxes for mail destined to those
points. Lewis threw the 800
cards in 25 minutes.

According to experiments made
at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, an
average of about six quarts of alcohol
can be made from each
pound of seaweed.

(Continued from Page One.)

OIL WORKER SEVERELY
BEATEN BY SEVEN MEN
Los Angeles, April 30. M. H.
Byrns, an oil worker, was severely
beaten early today by a band of seven
masked men about four miles east
of East Bakersfield, according to a
special dispatch to the Los Angeles
Examiner tonight.
Byrns was dragged from his
automobile, beaten and warned to
leave Kern county and never return.
It was said. He was found
roaming about the streets, dazed,
several hours later.

On the Hun river he witnessed the operations
of both armies, with Chang
Tso-Lin's troops holding the village
of Changsintien and the Wu-Pei-Fu
forces two miles southward
fighting desperately to advance.
Smoke from the cannon enveloped
the hillside; shells were
bursting in the trenches; camels
were to be seen transporting guns
to various points and refugees
were observed running from their
homes. A vivid picture of the
seriousness of the struggle was
obtained.

DR. SUN-YAT-SEN
TO JOIN CHANG-TSO-LIN:

(By Central Press.)
Bath, Me., April 30. This state
is watching with interest the developments
in what promises to be
the most torrid senatorial campaign
in its history. The contest is
for the seat now occupied by Senator
Frederick Hale, Republican,
whose term expires next March.
Hale is a candidate for the nomination
at the June primaries to
succeed himself. Two other men
seek the nomination. They are
Frank E. Guernsey, of Dover, a
former representative, and Howard
Davies of Yarmouth, who has
figured prominently in an unusual
political situation in recent
months.
Until a few weeks ago Hale's
friends were confident he would
win the nomination and be
reelected without serious opposition.
Then the entrance of Davies into
the primary race aroused the
Guernsey forces to action. Now
Hale's constituents are working in
earnest.
Hale is the son of the late Senator
Eugene Hale and is completing
his first term. Davies has gained
considerable attention through
a political battle over his appointment
as chairman of the public
Utilities corporation.
Governor Baxter nominated
Davies for the post and the executive
council refused to ratify the
appointment, its principal reason
being the fact that Davies supported
Governor Baxter in a water
power program which had caused
the previous chairman, Benjamin
F. Gleaves, to resign. Governor
Baxter finally withdrew Davies'
name and made a second appointment.
Davies is a well-known attorney
and has been prominent in both
branches of the state legislature.

In Japan a white or light-colored
mouse in the house is regarded as
a happy omen.

Dr. Sun added that he would
start shortly for north China.
