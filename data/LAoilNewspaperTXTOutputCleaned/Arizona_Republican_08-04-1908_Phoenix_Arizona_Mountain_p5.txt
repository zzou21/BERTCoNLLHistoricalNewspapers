ALL WHO ARE THERE
ARE UNDER A CHARM

Another Returned Camper From the
White Mountains.

Jim Graham came in yesterday
morning from the White
mountains where he had been a mem
ber of a camping party consisting of
Jake Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Love
itt and others. He confirms rumors
which have drifted down from that
delightful, but out of the way spot
that Jake Miller is losing flesh and
has been at it so long now that he is
used to it and glad of it. He is more
over so pleased with the country that
he will probably arrange for a per
manent abode there. There will be no
more of the coast for Mr. Miller. The
thing that took him there mainly was
the fishing, but there is no such fish
ing anywhere along the Pacific as is
afforded in the sparkling and ice cold
streams of the White mountains.
Farther down at points more easy of
access, the trout are getting shy, but
nearer the head waters they are abun
dant and eighteen of the speckled
beauties an hour is considered an av
erage catch for the average fisherman.
One of Mr. Graham's boys caught sixty-one
in a little more than two hours.
The ranges are in excellent shape;
everywhere the grass comes up to the
sides of a horse and the ground is
carpeted with a thick mat of the dead
grass of last year. That was what en
listed the sympathy of Mr. Miller, who
is an old cattleman. That grass is
going to put him back into the business.

Fishing is not the only attraction
there in the way of sport. One does
not have to hunt long for bear. There
used to be a good many deer in that
region, but there are comparatively few
now. Farther south in the more in
accessible region of Black river though
deer are abundant.
All the campers have been put under
great obligations to Agent Crouse of
the White river agency, who has left
nothing undone for their comfort and
accommodation.
There is what might appear to be a
drawback, but those who have been in
those recesses say it is not. That is
the isolation. No news from the out
side world percolates in for weeks af
ter it happens. Frank Loveitt on his
return on Saturday night said that he
never learned who was the democratic
nominee for the presidency until he
reached Globe. Mr. Graham said that
he did not hear that soon. He learned
that Bryan had been nominated only
after his arrival in Phoenix. While
nothing is heard in the White moun
tains about the outside world, nobody
who is there enjoying himself wants
to hear. That is one of the chief beau
ties of the trip.

PRAYER MEETING. The prayer
meeting at the Florence Crittenton
Home this evening will be led by
Robert Wilson. This will be the
last prayer meeting at the home un
til after the close of the South Meth
odist camp meeting.

TO BREAK GROUND. It is stat
ed that ground will be broken today
at Eastlake park for the new theater
which will be so built as to be
good for summer or winter business.
It is expected to have it completed
by September first.

MITCHELL'S
STOCK SUIT
Comes Up On Appeal From
Gila County

Action For Recovery of
20,000 Shares Mitchell
Mining Co. Stock.

The case of the Mitchell Mining
company against J. C. Britt, A. T.
Hammons and the Globe National
Bank was yesterday brought up from
the district court for Gila county on
appeal. The property involved con
sists of 20,000 shares of Mitchell Min
ing company stock of the par value
of $10 a share, alleged by George
Mitchell, the head of the plaintiff com
pany to have been obtained by Britt
by fraud.
The complaint states that Britt call
ed on Mitchell in New York to interest
him in certain mining properties near
Globe consisting of the Parker group
and other claims. In this negotiation
Britt was acting for himself and as
attorney in fact for Hammons.
It is alleged that Britt made certain
misrepresentations as to amount and
character of the ore in the property,
but Mitchell knowing of his reputation
in Globe and that he was a competent
mining man, relied on what Britt told
him and agreed to take the properties
over and put up a 300 ton smelter,
making Britt the superintendent of
operation at a salary of $300 a month.
Mitchell said he received reports
from Britt from time to time and all
were of the most favorable character.
Things were turning out so much bet
ter than they had seemed that Britt
thought that his report upon the prop
erty at the time he was trying to
make the sale was little short of a
slander.
In the meantime arrangements went
on for the smelter; the machinery was
shipped to Globe and was put up and
a time was set for blowing in the
smelter which had cost Mitchell $50,000.
For the first time Mitchell himself
came on the ground a short time before
the smelter was to be blown in and
about the same time Britt left the
country and at the time of the filing
of the complaint was still absent.
Mitchell who is a mining expert
himself soon discovered that the prop
erty was not what it had been repre
sented to him to be. There was no
ore of the richness described by Britt
and on many of the claims there was
no ore at all. There was really noth
ing for the smelter to do.

The only relief Mitchell asked at the
time was for the return of his stock
in exchange for which he would turn
the deeds back to Hammons.
It was found that of the Mitchell
Mining company stock, Hammons had
received only 300 shares from Britt;
8000 shares had been put into the
Globe National bank as collateral for
loans to Britt and no accounting has
been made or is mentioned in the com
plaint regarding the rest of the stock.

Mitchell applied for and was granted
a temporary injunction against Britt,
Hammons and the bank restraining
them from disposing of the stock to
any other than the plaintiff.
When the matter came up for trial
Mitchell who was really the only wit
ness for the plaintiff was sick at Los
Angeles. Nobody else of the Mitchell
Mining company knew anything about
the deal with Britt. An effort was
made by the attorneys for the plaintiff
to secure a continuance on the ground
of the illness of Mitchell. The motion
for continuance was denied and the
case went to trial on the deposition of
Mitchell.

One point offered by the defense was
the negligence of Mitchell and another
was the irresponsibility of Hammons
for the acts of Britt. As to the bank
it was stated that the loan had been
made to Britt at the request of the
Arizona National Bank of Tucson. The
demurrer of the bank to the complaint
was sustained and on the trial the in
junction was dismissed as to Ham
mons. From these orders the appeal was
taken.

AMUSEMENTS

If you have the blues and are seek
ing a remedy, try Manager Whitaker
and his company in "All the Comforts
of Home" at East Lake Park tonight.
It is worth while. Those who went
out last night with the idea of getting
a laugh or two, got more than they
bargained for. That delightful scream
ing farce kept the audience in an up
roar from rise of the curtain until its
fall.
The entire company was at its best.
It must be more at home in this pro
duction, for it went smoother than any
play heretofore. Miss Pitt received
her much earned rest, as the part she
played did not require very much of
her presence on the stage. Mr. Whit
aker shouldered the majority of the
burden, and as usual came out with
"colors flying."
Mr. Reynolds deserves great praise
for the dash and vim which character
ized his acting throughout the en
tire performance. The play shall be
repeated tonight and tomorrow night.
Thursday night "The Little Minister"
will be presented.

Melodrama is the play of human life,
and no better example could be found
than How Hearts Are Broken as play
ed by the Earl Burgess Co., at the
Olympic last night. The play has just
that sympathetic touch that every au
dience likes. Mona Fancher a poor
fisherwoman lives alone on the coast.
She is approached by the young dis
trict attorney of the county, who of
fers to be her friend. Already a wife
and mother she spurns him. Her child
is stolen and murdered and she is
held for the deed. The trial in the old
village court room was a realistic scene.
Mr. Lytton did the prosecuting attor
ney, and handled the witnesses. One
by one they testify, and the case looks
black against Mona, until a young
southern lawyer, played by Mr. Corn
ell, takes her case, and in an impas
sioned speech wins it amid the cheers
of the spectators. The scene fairly
brought the audience cheering to its
feet. Miss Anderson drew the charac
ter of Mona true to life, Mr. Percival
played a blind old fiddler in a way
that showed him to be a master of
character drawings and a clever piece
of work was the hypocritical Wolvin
in the hands of George W. Haley.
Tonight the company present Deal
ers in White Women said to be the
most daring play ever written. A
world of sensation is promised, in fact
the play is said to be one of the most
thrilling melodramas.
Wednesday night will mark the per
formance of A Royal Prisoner, a cos
tume play after the style of The Pris
oner of Zenda. It offers exceptional
scenic opportunities and the costumes
will be accurate and of the period.
There will be a special souvenir mati
nee Saturday. The dance after the
performance last night proved very
enjoyable and will be repeated. The
orchestra, under the skillful guidance
of Professor Illig, was excellent. The
Olympic has the best dancing floor in
the city.

THE POOL TOURNAMENT. At
last night's play at the tournament at
the Capitol Pool room between Clark
and Weeks, the former won by a score
of 75 to 23. Tonight the play will be
between Ludlum and Michelson.

Oil Co., 57 cents F. O. B. Sourlake,
Texas; Shattuck and Nimmo, $3.05
at Roosevelt, and $3.30 for hauling from
Mesa to Roosevelt; Associated Oil Co.,
73 cents at Oil City, Calif.

FOUGHT AT A DISTANCE.

Chicago, Aug. 3. A fire so hot that
the firemen could not get nearer
than a block which made it neces
sary to play streams of water on the
buildings three and four squares
away this afternoon destroyed the
Burlington elevators E and F, the
Rock Island transfer warehouse and
either burned or rendered useless 500
box cars.

The loss in grain in the two
elevators is placed by Armour & Co.,
who owned them at $700,000. The
total loss is placed at $1,700,000. The
fire started in the Burlington ware
house supposedly from a cigarette.
There was an explosion that shook
every building in the vicinity. Two
hundred and fifty men employed in
the warehouse and elevators fled and
it is believed all escaped.
