Aged Couple Celebrate
Their Golden Wedding

The 50th anniversary of a happy
wedding performed on St. Valentine's
day was celebrated Tuesday when
friends and relatives gathered to pay
their respects and to do honor to Mr.
and Mrs. W. K. McKenzie at their
home in this city.

The home was decorated most appro-
priately with hearts and flowers. Lun-
cheon was served at 2:30 o'clock in a
room darkened and lighted with candles.
This was an observance of a marriage
custom prevalent in the Middle States
in 1860, the year when Mr. and Mrs.
McKenzie were married in Missouri.

After luncheon a golden piece was
presented to the white-haired couple at the
conclusion of a speech by Rev. Mulhol-
land. There were a number of other
presents.

The affair was arranged by Mrs. J. D.
Goodwin of Oakland and Miss Frances
McKenzie of San Jose, the daughters of
Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie.

For the past nine years Mr. and Mrs.
McKenzie have been residents of this
city. They came to this city from Ply-
mouth, Amador county. The guests
were:

Master Vernon McKenzie Goodwin,
Mrs. O. Johnston, Mrs. C. F. Withrow,
Mrs. C. Bury, Mrs. E. Forward, Mrs. H.
E. Emler, Miss Pfelfle, Mr. and Mrs.
Meadow, Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Mulholland,
Mr. and Mrs. L. Ross, J. D. Goodwin,
Oakland; G. T. Woolfolk, Dawson,
Alaska, Withrow, San Jose

First on the Ground.

Antone Reale announces himself in
this issue as a candidate for the republi-
can nomination for county recorder,
subject to the decision of the August
primary election. This is the first an-
nouncement for a county office under the
new law. Mr. Reale is at present en-
gaged in mining near Volcano. He is
well qualified for the position. He was
county recorder for one term about 20
years ago. He has many friends
throughout the county, who would
exert themselves to secure his success
at the polls.

While it is often impossible to pre-
vent an accident, it is never impossible
to be prepared—it is not beyond any
one's purse. Invest 25 cents in a
bottle of Chamberlain's liniment and
you are prepared for sprains, bruises
and like injuries. Sold by all dealers.

Caminetti and Office.

It may be stated that Senator Cami-
netti's name is mentioned with the
position of governor, as also that of
member of state board of railroad
commissioners, to represent the first
district, which comprises the counties
of Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras,
Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn,
Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino,
Modoc, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas,
Sacramento, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou,
Sonoma, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo
and Yuba.

It is believed that he would not be
averse to holding the former position,
but he refuses to be considered in con-
nection with the latter.

Caminetti, unhesitatingly declares
that he will not consider any suggestion
of a candidacy for that office, on the
ground that he knows nothing about the
railroad business. He says the position
of commissioner should be filled by a
practical and well-informed business
man and shipper.—Oakland Enquirer.

An attack of the grip is often fol-
lowed by a persistent cough, which to
many proves great annoyance. Cham-
berlain's cough remedy has been exten-
sively used and with good success for
the relief and cure of this cough. Many
cases have been cured after all other
remedies had failed. Sold by all dealers.

Reorganization of
Light Company.

The Amador Electric Railway and
Light Company has been reorganized
under the more appropriate name of the
Amador Electric Light and Power Com-
pany. When the company was first or-
ganized it was proposed to build an
electric railroad from Ione to the
mineral belt. This was in the early
nineties. The railway scheme was af-
terwards abandoned, but the company has
been supplying light and power to Sutter
Creek, Jackson, Amador City, and other
points, doing a very lucrative business.
At the meeting at which the reorganiza-
tion was effected 27,000 shares were
represented, out of a total issue of
30,000 shares. E. C. Voorheis, who has
been president of the company from the
start, was re-elected president, and C.
R. Downs vice president. The principal
place of business is at Sutter Creek.

An Old Resident
Answers the Final Call

J. R. Dunlap, an old and highly re-
spected citizen of this county, died at
his home in Amador City yesterday
morning. Deceased had been failing in
health for a long time, but was able to
be around until within a few days of
the end. He has been a prominent busi-
ness man of this county for the last
forty years. He was formerly a partner
with Jackson Dennis in the drug store
business in Sutter Creek. After dis-
solving this business relationship over
thirty years ago, he entered the same
line of business in Amador City, and
has remained there ever since, and dur-
ing the greater part of the time being
postmaster of that town. He was a man
of scrupulous integrity, and his death
will be deeply deplored by a large circle
of friends and acquaintances.

Deceased had suffered two strokes of
paralysis before, but was able to appear
at the store up to a week previous to
his death. The immediate cause of
death was heart failure. He leaves a
wife and one grown-up son.

F. O. E. Ball.

Washington's birthday was celebrated
in Jackson by a grand ball given by
Amador Aerie Fraternal Order of Eagles,
in Love's hall Tuesday evening. There
was a fair attendance. Music was fur-
nished by the local orchestra under the
management of Professor Schultz. The
financial outcome we have not learned,
but understand the receipts and expenses
were about equal. The participants
had a thoroughly enjoyable time, and
dancing was kept up until an early hour
Wednesday morning.

Women's Exchange.

The Woman's Exchange this week
will be at Air G. W. Brown's office
next to Mrs. Conlon's, and will be in
charge of Mrs. Brown and Mrs. E. Wil-
liams. They will have for sale, cakes,
pies, and other good things to eat.
Don't fail to call on them for something
good to eat.

Severe Hemorrhage

Joseph Casagrande, the Sutter Creek
baker, was seized with a serious at-
tack of bleeding of the nose about noon
while delivering bread to his customers
in Jackson last Saturday. The attack
came on suddenly. The crimson fluid
streamed from his nostrils in such
alarming quantity that he repaired to the
office of Dr. Sprague. The doctor suc-
ceeded in stopping the bleeding, and the
patient repaired to his home in Sutter
Creek, where he has been under treat-
ment since.

If troubled with indigestion, constipa-
tion, no appetite or feel bilious, give
Chamberlain's stomach and liver tablets
a trial and you will be pleased with the
result. These tablets invigorate the
stomach and liver and strengthen the
digestion. Sold by all dealers.

MINING NOTES

South Eureka. — The additional 20
stamps to the mill were started last
Monday, making forty stamps of their
own mill. The mill has been con-
structed in every respect after the most
approved method, and works to a charm.
It is reported that the last clean-up was
$33,000, and a dividend was paid of
three cents per share, making $9,000.
Besides making vast improvements the
company has been accumulating a sur-
plus, as a provision against any emer-
gency. Everything about the mine is
looking prosperous. It is in fact one of
the big mines of Amador county, and
has forged to that position during the
past year. The stock is worth between
$4 and $4.50 per share.

Mason Mine— A Jackson dispatch to
the Sacramento Bee dated February 21,
has this to say of this mining claim,
situated near Clinton: The Mason
mine in this county, owned by Stockton
people, has just been sold to Amador
capitalists. The Stockton owners are
Robert Boyce, Charles Newton, John
Perrott, James Perrott, George Godell,
Dr. S. E. Latta and the Woods brothers.
They owned the Mason mine about
twelve years, during a part of which
time it has been actively operated. A
mill, buildings and other equipment
form a part of the property sold. The
entire acreage represented is about 100
acres. The mine is a gold-producing
property and is considered a banner in-
vestment.

Original Amador — This mine at
Amador City, which started its new 20
stamp mill only a few weeks ago, has
been closed down temporarily, owing it
is said to some differences among the
managers. Rumor has it that the last
clean-up was very satisfactory, amount-
ing to over $20,000. Operations will
no doubt be in full swing again in a
few days.

Argonaut— This company paid its
regular monthly dividend of five cents
per share on the 21st, amounting to
$10,000.

Keystone— According to current re-
port the new company now operating
this famous property at Amador City
made a very successful run last month,
cleaning up with its sixty stamp mill
over $40,000, which leaves a handsome
margin over expenses. The ore is
coming from about the 1400 level.
The managers are naturally elated over
the improved prospects, and are satisfied
they have a valuable property still
which is a long way from being ex-
hausted by the treasures it has surren-
dered to its fortunate stockholders
during its fifty years of gold production.

At the annual stockholders meeting of
the Original Amador Mines Company
held at Oakland, California, on the 14th
instant, the following board of directors
was elected: J. B. Mann, Paul S.
Coke, G. W. Caldwell, C. L. Strum
and W. L. Whitaker, W. F. Deaner be-
ing retained as manager. The annual re-
port showed the company to be in ex-
cellent financial condition, and while no
information regarding the output of the
mine has been made public it is under-
stood that the management is more than
pleased with results.

Masonic Installation
In Drytown.

Brilliant entertainment pleased Ply-
mouth, Amador and Drytown visitors,
which was also in the nature of a cele-
bration of the birthday of Washington,
he being the first master of a Masonic
lodge in the United States. The ban-
quet room being decorated with red,
white and blue by the ladies, and several
pieces of art, emblems of Washington's
Masonic life, were on the tables.

After the installation the ladies took
the program in charge. Among the
several numbers was a comic piece, or
burlesque on the four degrees of
Masonry, entitled, "Woman Suffrage-
Female Masons." The electric lights
were turned off, the performers using
lighted candles only on their respective
altars. And being dressed Ku-Klux
Klan style, skull and cross bones, each
lady chanting:
"We're a band of sister Masons gay,
Man at last has had his day,
He's not in it any more,
We should have done this long be-
fore."

The fourth was administered to two
candidates in due ancient form, amid
the laughter of the audience.
The performers were: Mrs. John G.
Smith, Miss Bertha Mart-hand, the
Misses Carley, Miss Kelley, Miss
Roberts, Mrs. Allen and Charlotte
Smith with Frank Mann's goat.
A delicious chicken supper was:
served after the entertainment by the
ladies. The principal officers installed
by Drytown Masonic lodge were George
L. Lynch, W. M.; Trevor Weston, S. W.;
John G. Smith, J. W.
