THE WHITE WINGS POULTRY
RANCH

One of the best known poultrymen
of the Salt River Valley is W. W. Carney,
of Mesa, for a number of years.
Mr. Carney has taken most of the blue
ribbons offered at the Fairs and Poultry shows all over the state, for White
Leghorns. He is, as may well be imagined,
an enthusiastic breeder of this

popular fowl. Much of his stock is from a
"Rgs or birds form probably the best
known breeder of White Leghorns in
America, center of the building.

On the White Wings poultry ranch, as the
sign at the gate indicates the name of the place, the utility is not
surpassed, even though the blue ribbons are won. The average egg production of the entire flock, which is a
little short of one thousand in numbers,
is 543 eggs each for the year. A very
good average. Although an important
branch of the business is the selling
of day-old chicks, this is not allowed
to interfere with supplying certain customers with guaranteed eggs, and it
should be said that his customers, (retail dealers in some of the mining
towns of the state,) are very anxious
to have the eggs from the White Wings
ranch at a substantial advance over
the local market quotations.

accompanied by an unusually heavy

turnover.
United States Steel, Bethlehem Steel
and other issues of that class were lifted
to 3 points, with 2 points for United
States Steel.
Shippings, which were most directly
affected by the decision to arm ships of
American registry, gained 1 to 1/2
points, particularly Leather, Paper and
Motors, as well as accessories of the
latter, rose 1 to 3 points, with an additional 5 points for General Motors,
making an extreme advance of 10 points

lighted and well ventilated incubator
cellar, with a capacity of 7,000 eggs.
One mammoth incubator and a number of small ones are the machines that
are turning out the chicks at this season of the year by hundreds and thousands.
That 65 per cent of all eggs placed
in the incubators hatch into healthy
chicks, is sufficient assurance that
there is careful and efficient management.

WEEKLY FINANCIAL STATEMENT
NEW YORK March 10 The market events of the week unquestionably
the decision of the federal administration to adopt a policy of
armed neutrality and convene an extra
session of congress, did not materialize
until the market had evinced a strong
disposition to shake off its present
depression.
This feeling was evidenced not so
much in the gradual increase of operations as in the steady advance of
prices in almost all issues except rails,
The latter were again under restraint
because of moderate but persistent

liquidation of high grade shares, presumably for foreign account.
Much of the week's activity may
safely be ascribed to the professional
element, that faction again taking up
the more speculative specialties. The
strength of seasoned industrials resulted, however, from known trade

the eggs. Green stuff is given them at
an early age. ...
Among the laying stock we find some
of the best males, (and there is one
which costs $50), mated to some choice
females in breeding yards. There is little choice among the laying hens, all
being of good type and having the appearance of vitality so much to be desired in the bred to lay stock. The main flock has free range, with
colony coops. These coops are well arranged for roosting and also furnish
shade and laying room. All nests being
arranged on the end so that the eggs
may be gathered from the outside. Food
for the laying flock is grain fed in litter twice daily, and a dry mash which
is fed in open troughs, this method
having proved to be less wasteful than
the hopper feeding.
Keeping about the ranch is arranged so that the maximum efficiency. Part of the time Mr. and Mrs. Carney is
devoted to attending to the many details connected with the poultry ranch.

CHICAGO GRAIN
CHICAGO, March 10 Notwithstanding that the wheat market averaged
higher today, peace rumors gave quotations a downward sweep in the last
hour. Closing quotations were un
settled, ranging from 114 net lower to
advance, with May at $1.86 to
$1.86 and July at $1.5634. Corn lost
2 to 3 cents and oats 2 to 3 cents.
Provisions wound up with gains of to 20
cents.
Moderate advances, interrupted by
numerous transient setbacks, were
brought about in wheat prices as a result of President Wilson's orders for
the arming of American merchant
ships. Reports that the British government was negotiating for the purchase of
the entire Canadian crop of
1917 tended also for a while to give
considerable advantage to the bulls,
and so likewise did severe dust storms
in Kansas.
Corn swayed with wheat, advancing
early and sagging later. On the upturn
the market touched a new high record
price, $1.10 for May delivery. Oats
were guided entirely by the action of
other grains.
Relatively high prices which the
British government fixed for lard at
Liverpool did a good deal to tighten
the provision market here, besides rev-

used to know at school. In the good old
days, he ran a clothes pressing establishment to pay his college tuition and board.
Now he rides in a Locomobile limousine and
clips coupons for exercise. His explanation
was: "I SAW SOMETHING TO DO AND
I DID IT."
He cut the word "procrastination" out of his vocabulary, just as

A few years ago Jackling, the "Copper Wizard," went into Ray to

holders are "clipping the coupons."
Fred Young went to Ray to make a mine out of the ARIZONA

he strikes the ore where are you going to be in the rank of foresighted ARIZONA RAY stockholders, or with the chaps who pay
