Mines and Mining

BLACK ROCK DISTRICT.
Big Mines to Be Opened Up in
(Maricopa County.
Mr. W. H. Burrage, of the Santa Rita
Copper company, is in Phoenix
and is stopping at the Ford. It was
the Burrages who made the greatest
copper deal ever consummated in the
southwest and the name is familiar
now to every mining man in the
country. The Santa Rita copper claims
located in New Mexico were purchased
by a company which was formed by a
cousin of Mr. W. H. Burrage. The sale
meant a cash exchange of $1,400,000
for the Santa Rita claims. Since the
sale work has been started in developing
the claims for the production of
copper, and Mr. Burrage thinks that
the Santa Rita will be one of the
greatest copper camps in the southwest
in a few years.
Mr. W. H. Burrage comes to Arizona
to make copper mines. He represents
the capitalists who are associated with
his cousin in the Santa Rita claims. A
large number of claims have been
purchased in the Black Rock mining
district about eighteen miles southeast
of Wickenburg. The development of these
claims during Mr. Burrage's visit to
Phoenix today is for the purpose of
making camp purchases and attending
to other business of the company.
"We are simply prospecting," he
said to a Herald reporter this morning.
"On the surface we have the indications
of copper, and that is about all. So
far we have not reached the water level,
and until we do the result of our efforts
will not be known. In the development
of the claims we have not been able to
get out of the oxide ores, and whether
we strike the copper or the iron pyrites
at the water level is still a gamble. Of
course we hope that the iron will remain
above and give us copper sulphide ore
at depth, but one never knows what is
going to take place in mining. If the
iron pyrites appear the claim will be
worthless, and we must take this chance.
A man can't go out and find a mine
before breakfast in any mining country.
It takes years of work and often a mine
is found where the surface would not
indicate it.
"We have about fifty claims altogether,
too many if the ore does not develop,
and not enough if we find what we are
going after. In the work that has been
done we have been unfortunate, and it
seems that something always appears to
prevent us from attaining the water level.
The water came in and drove us out and
when we put in diamond drills we found
that no headway could be made. Now we
are going to put in steam pumps and a
steam hoist and we think we will be able
to cope with the water and get down on
the vein."
Mr. Burrage is a thorough mining man
and it is fortunate that the Black Rock
district is receiving his attention. He
will make a mine if there is a chance
of doing so. He stated that the claims
would be equipped with works as soon
as sufficient ore is developed. Mr. Burrage
says that if a body of sulphide ore
is struck that averages four or five per
cent he will feel amply repaid for his
explorations. At the present stage of the
development the indications are favorable,
but there still lurks that element of
uncertainty which makes mining a gamble
until the prospecting stage is passed. When
the ore is found it becomes a strictly
business proposition. And it is remarkable
that most men fail after the gambling
stage is passed and business tact and
mature judgment is required.
Mr. Burrage will leave tonight for
Wickenburg.

ARIZONA MINES.
Something About Deep Workings
in This Territory.
Long before Arizona settled down to
peaceful mining, when miners worked
with rifles by their side in daily expectation
of Apache raids, prospectors were
exploring the great copper belt that lies
on the east line of Yavapai county, and
as far back as 1873 some feeble efforts
were made to work the tremendous vein
that starts at the now world-famous
United Verde mine on the north and
strikes due south, its cropping rising boldly
until it passes from sight just south of
the Great Western mine, near Copper
Mountain twenty-six miles of vein matter
exposed between two wonderful quartz
dykes that form the hanging and foot wall
of this mother vein of copper ore, says
the Denver Mining Reporter. Disappointments
were encountered in the early work on
this astonishing mineral lode. In many
places there was mineral at the surface,
but with a few feet of work the metal
passed out, leaving only a red mineralized
gangue that would out no favorable inducements
to the miner of that day. Then our
mining scientists were unacquainted with
leached ground, and when the black
metal, now so indicative of the sulphurets
deeper down, was found to disappear
Arizona received the name of being a
shallow mining country.
But how mistaken were the early pioneers,
many of whom have passed away before
their theory was passed by.
Fin, and the most wonderful mine in
the world located upon this vein. Instead
of being shallow, development has shown
that the mines of Arizona are the deepest
of all mineral fields. There are, even to
this day, only six or eight 1000-foot shafts
in the territory and in every case where
development has been prosecuted to great
depth there is found tremendous ore
bodies. Notable examples of this are
found in the Copper Queen, Globe,
Clifton, Congress, Senator, and the great
United Verde, not yet down 1000 feet.
In olden times, when leached ground was
struck, the mines were abandoned; today,
we find great mining companies welcoming
the arrival of this old, unsought visitor.
Leaching ground on the mother vein of
Yavapai county is the evidence of greater
riches; but the question of how far below
the sulphurets lay, is a matter of conjecture
in some cases three and four hundred feet.

MINING NOTES.
Mr. S. W. Traylor, representing the
Colorado Iron Works at Denver, has
just made a tour of the territory and
was in Mexico on business with the
Cobre Grande company. He says that
improvements will be made in the
smelter and that already 160 tons of
ore are smelted daily. The ore averages
about 14 per cent.
The supply of coke for the Cobre
Grande smelter will be shipped hereafter
from Nogales to the camp instead of from
Naco as formerly, says the Vidette. The
distance from this point to the camp is
seventy-five miles.
R. H. George of Phoenix, who has the
contract for hauling ore from the mines,
loaded Wednesday with coke. He has
eight six-mule teams, and says K. Tooley
will arrive from Naco in a few days and
will commence to transport a carload a
day in trains of three wagons each. The
importance of Nogales as a shipping and
outfitting center, and its varied advantages
to mining and cattle interests is attracting
wide attention.
The Yuma Sun says that Ira P.
Smith and Mulford Winsor made a
short trip this week to Copper Mountain
where they have taken a bond on several
groups of copper and gold bearing claims.
A number of important deals which will
probably be closed in a short time are on
the tapis in that district. While only a
limited amount of development work has
been done, the district shows up exceedingly
well, and if capital can be induced to
take hold Copper Mountain will undoubtedly
develop into one of the great camps of
the territory.
Billy Evans returned yesterday from
the King of Arizona mine. The pump
has broken down again and operations
are temporarily suspended, says the
Yuma Sentinel.
Several claims have recently been
located near the old Yuma mines.
H. W. Blaisdell of Yuma is spending a
few weeks at Orcie. Mr. Blaisdell is
largely interested in the new cyanide
plant at Mammoth.
R. C. Bricets, A. Brichta, F. W.
Cooper and his brother Cooper, form a
party who are camped in the Tucson
mountains for the purpose of giving
that section a thorough prospecting. They
have already taken the preliminary steps
of locating mineral claims. One, the El
Pecos, promises to become a good property
as specimens of ore make a good showing
in copper.
The Demorest mine in the Des Cabezas
mining district has recently been
bonded to parties whom Expert Frank
represents. Two thousand dollars has
been paid down. Work will commence
in thirty days. Tombstone Prospector.
A drilling contest is to take place in
Denver in October which will be participated
in by Dan and Charley McGowan and
George Beck.
L. A. Dunham, a mining man from
El Paso, has been looking over the
mineral field in the Riverside section.
A large amount of freight is passing
through Florence for the Ray mine,
Shields & Price have the hauling contract.
J. H. Barrett, Eugene Larrien and
D. C. Thurman of Cochise county were
in Florence this week on mining business.
They brought in some rich copper ore
from some claims located by them on
the desert. Florence Tribune.

LAST OF CARDIFF GIANT
Resting Place of This Almost Forgotten Fraud.
The scientific mind is inclined to
take things rather philosophically, but
when the Cardiff giant was unearthed
in 1869 the question as to whether it
was McWhorten's Phoenician god or
Marsh's gypsum fraud caused a war
of words that not only extended over
the whole of the United States, but
invaded the classic precincts of the
mother countries.
After Prof. Marsh had demonstrated
to the satisfaction of all, except Prof.
McWhorten and the owners, that what
would have been the eighth wonder of
the world, was the most gigantic fraud
of the age, interest in the stone giant
gradually subsided, until today few
know its subsequent history.
Mexico has long been noted
as a rich field for archaeological research,
and today the accommodating Mexican
Indian will unearth for the credulous
tourist anything from a water jug to
an idol. A few of El Paso's enterprising
citizens, having learned that after drifting
about the country to be gazed at with awe
by the rustic eye, the giant had stranded
at New Orleans, conceived the brilliant
but worn idea of planting the giant in
Mexico's far soil, to be exhumed again
with all the excitement of a new discovery.
Covered with coal, and sent speeding on
its long journey with great expectations
for the future. The fraud was detected
at El Paso, and, owing to the excessive
freight charges and duty on statuary into
Mexico, the enterprise was abandoned.
The giant thereupon became an object
of interest in one of El Paso's many
saloons. For a time much amusement and
profit were derived from sending word
to the "initiated" that Major Stoneham
was down in Ryan's saloon making insulting
remarks about him. In an incredibly
short time the victim walked in with
blood in his eye and a 44 in each hand
to be introduced to Major Stoneham,
and, incidentally, to treat the waiting
crowd.
At last, even to be the center of attraction
in an El Paso saloon was denied the
giant, and today the sightseer, to see the
giant, will have to go through the shady
streets of El Paso to the northern extremity
of the city, and climb the mesa bluff some
300 feet to what was formerly a summer
beer garden, but is now a private home.
As he drops into a convenient rustic seat
to recover his breath, his eye will rest
lovingly on the city at his feet; a little
beyond, the quaint old Mexican city of
Juarez, and on and on as far as the eye
can see a dreary waste of sand, sagebrush
and mesquite, enlivened by the windings
of the green-fringed Rio Grande. Rising
and passing behind the old dance pavilion,
he will find, inclosed in a wire screen,
the Cardiff giant. Time and El Paso air
have not dealt kindly with him; cracks
and fissures long and deep cover his
surface. One leg is broken in several
places, and summer rains have made
many pitholes.
To nearly all he is but a stone giant
of little interest, but now and then one
comes who inspects minutely the nearly
forgotten form, and smiles to himself as
his mind reverts to the early '70s with
its crowds and excitement and titling of
the tongues. And here on this sunlit hill,
where the soft sweet air murmurs of rest
and peace and the breezes are perfumed
by the mountain's breath, we will leave
this relic of the incredulity of man to
crumble to dust and be forgotten. Buffalo

INGERSOLL'S POLICE FRIENDS
Were All Over the Country - One of
the Times They Helped Him.
"The late Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll
probably stood higher in police and
detective circles than any public man
of the present day," observed a visiting
detective officer the other day, "and it
all came about by the address he delivered
over the grave of a detective's child in
this city. That address touched them all,
whether they concurred in the religious
doctrine or not that made up the greater
part of the address or not, and there
was nothing that they could do for him
that they did not. Of all the lecturers
traveling throughout this country he was
regarded as specially the friend of the
policeman, and this assistance from the
hundreds of thousands of policemen and
detectives turned many a big bag of money
into his receipts. In many cities he was
taken in charge by the police on his
arrival and helped in every way until
he left. I remember, on one occasion
he lectured in a city in which I was located.
It was in the winter time and he discovered
as he was leaving the theater that his
overcoat had been stolen. He informed
the police officers at the theater of the
loss of the coat and asked their assistance
in recovering it. He was assured that
the coat would be recovered by the time
he needed it the next morning if there
was anything that could be done by the
police, and in the meantime an overcoat
was borrowed for him to wear to his hotel.
It was in a big city where there were a
large number of thieves. The robbery was
reported to police headquarters and a
special consultation held. The chief of
police gave orders that the coat had to be
recovered by the next morning, even if
it was necessary to lock up every thief
in the city. Orders were sent to all the
precincts in the city to arrest every thief
that was known and hold them until further
notice. By 1 o'clock that night there
were over 100 thieves under arrest. They
were told of the robbery and were informed
that they would be held under arrest until
the coat came back. All of them were
allowed to communicate freely with their
associates, police and detective officers
carrying their messages out. By 3 o'clock
that morning each thief had on an average
three associates engaged in the hunt for
Colonel Ingersoll's coat and some of them
as many as a dozen. The result of the
several hundred engaged in looking for the
stolen coat was that by 5 o'clock that
morning it was 'turned up' by one of the
thieves' friends. It appears that the man
who stole it did not know to whom the
coat belonged. He picked it up near the
door of the theater, where it had been
carelessly left by the stage manager. The
coat was handed to 'Colonel Bob' before
he had breakfast. It was rather an outrageous
thing to do as far as personal liberty
and rights are concerned, but it showed
how hard the police could work when they
wanted to help out a friend. The police
of that city regarded it as a reflection on
them that Colonel Ingersoll was robbed
of his coat and were determined to square
themselves in his favor regardless of the
consequences." Washington Star.

GENEROUS FATHER-IN-LAW.
John Mackay to Build a Country Home
for His Son's Wife.
On the highest portion of Long Island,
lying to the westward of the Wheatley
hills, which commands a view of the
ocean and sound, John W. Mackay has
purchased an estate, on which will be
erected a large country mansion, destined
to become the property of the millionaire's
daughter-in-law, Mrs. Clarence Mackay,
as a wedding present. Not less than half
a million dollars will be expended by
Mr. Mackay before he considers this
present to his daughter-in-law complete.
Already nearly 700 acres of land have
been bought at an average price of $300
an acre, and other purchases of property
are contemplated. Mr. Mackay determined
upon a certain price per acre, and this
he has paid throughout, even when the
owner's asking price was below that figure.
On the other hand, he has refused to buy
from those who have asked exorbitant
sums. In the heart of the estate was
a negro cemetery. When he was informed
of this fact by his agents he wired them:
"Purchase the cemetery and have the
bodies moved to another." Within neighboring
distance of the Mackay place are the
estates of General Lloyd Brice, Stanley
Mortimer, Albert Stevens, Foxhall Keene,
Perry Tiffany, Edward T. Cushing, Charles
G. Peters, Mrs. Kinsley Magowan, Robert
Dudley Winthrop, Edwin D. Morgan,
William C. Whitney, James F. D. Lanier,
Rawlins Cottenet and Thomas Hitchcock,
Jr.

A TIE VOTE.
Mr. Jones But if the women had
the ballot elections would be useless.
Mrs. Jones Why?
Mr. Jones Why, every woman
would vote exactly opposite to her husband,
and that would make the entire vote a tie.
