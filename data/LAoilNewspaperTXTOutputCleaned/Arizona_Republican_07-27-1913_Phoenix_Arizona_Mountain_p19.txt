PAGE NINETEEN

CHANCING CHARACTER OF OUR
EXPORTS
The changing character of the ex
port trade of the United States is
illustrated by comparison of the ex
ports of certain important articles in
1913 with those of a decade earlier,
1903. The total exports of 1913, ac
cording to the latest figures of the
bureau of foreign and domestic com
merce, department of commerce, are
approximately $2,450,000,000, against $1,392,000,000 in 1903, having thus nearly
doubled in the decade; but the details
show that the growth in manufactured articles has been much greater
than that in foodstuffs, and consider
ably greater than in raw materials.
Foodstuffs as a whole show exports
in 1913 almost identical with those of
1903 approximately $510,000,000 in
each of the years named, and this
equality in values indicates a reduc
tion in quantity, in view of the ad
vance in prices meantime. Manufacturers' materials show a growth
from $409,000,000 in 1903 to approxi
mately $740,000,000 in 1913. Manu
factures show a much larger growth,
having been, in 1903, $468,000,000, and
in 1913 approximately $1,200,000,000.
In the above figures foodstuffs in the
manufactured state are included in
the general group of "foodstuffs," and
are not included in the general group
of "manufactures."
It is in the detailed consideration of
the exports that the contrast with
conditions a decade ago is more strik
ing. Fresh beef exports, for example,
have fallen from 255,000,000 pounds in
1903 to 7,000,000 in 1913; beef cattle,
from $30,000,000 value in 1903 to $1,
000,000 in 1913, and canned beef from
76,000,000 pounds in 1903 to 7,000,000
in 1913. Exports of pork products
show a much less fall than those of
beef, though the total value of all
meat products, except cattle, has fallen
from $176,000,000 in 1903 to about
$150,000,000 in 1913.
It is in manufactured articles that
the most striking increases in exports
occur. Iron and steel manufactures,
as a whole, show an increase from
$97,000,000 in 1903 to a little over
$300,000,000 in 1913; copper manufac
tures, including pigs and bars in this
general term, increased from $40,000,000 in 1903 to $140,000,000 in 1913.
Mineral oils, a little more than dou
bled, from $61,000,000 value in 1903
to $130,000,000 in 1913, and coal in
creased from $21,000,000 value in
1903 to $65,000,000 in 1913. Cotton
manufactures increased about 70 per
cent., their total exports having
been $32,000,000 in 1903, and approxi
mately $54,000,000 in 1913. Machinery, as a whole, increased from $51,
000,000 in 1903 to approximately $130,
000,000 in 1913; metal working ma
chinery, from $3,000,000, to $16,000,
000; agricultural implements, from
$21,000,000 to $42,000,000; engines,
from $6,000,000 to $26,000,000; type
writers, from $4,000,000 to $11,000,
000, and sewing machines, from $5,
000,000 to $12,000,000 during the dec
ade. Of wire, the exports increased
from $5,000,000 in 1903 to $12,500,000
in 1913; while iron and steel sheets
and plates increased from $1,000,000 to
$24,000,000; tin plates, from 1,500,000
pounds to 165,000,000; and automo
biles from $1,000,000 value in 1903
to $32,000,000 in the fiscal year just
ended.
Other articles which show striking
increases during the decade are pat
ent medicines, of which the exports
advanced from $3,500,000 to $7,000,000;
furs and fur skins, from $6,000,000 to
$19,000,000; boots and shoes from $6,
500,000 to $18,000,000; India rubber
manufactures (produced from mate
rial brought from other parts of the
world), from $4,500,000 to $14,000,000;
and silk manufactures (also produc
ed from imported material), from
$500,000 to $2,500,000. Exports of
eggs, despite the advance in prices in
the domestic markets, increased from
1,500,000 dozen in 1903 to 21,000,000
dozen in 1913.
