FINANCIAL AND MARKET NEWS

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market
[Republican A. P. Leased Wire]
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.—Shorts had
an uncomfortable time in the two
hours of today’s trading on the stock
exchange, the market suddenly turning
active and strong under the lead
of favorite industrials and rails.
American and Baldwin Locomotive
shares, American Car, Westinghouse,
Bethlehem Steel and the prominent
motors followed the rebound. These
were supplemented by oils, including
the foreign group, also by shippings
and sugar, the latter strengthening
on higher prices for the refined product.
Rock Island was the most conspicuous
of rails, rising 3½ points on
heavy buying. Moderate advances
among investment rails gave way to
realizing sales before the close, but
local tractions were in steady demand.
The few issues to show reactionary
tendencies included American
Tobacco; common and preferred, due
mainly to yesterday’s emission of the
preferred dividend; American Writing
Paper preferred and textile specialties,
notably Phillips-Jones. Sales amounted
to 335,000 shares.
Among the factors in the stock
market was the recurrent strength of
foreign exchanges. Sterling rose almost
two cents over yesterday’s high.
Allied remittances were eight to
about 20 points better and Dutch and
Scandinavian rates extended recent
substantial gains.
The clearing house statement disclosed
another large decrease of
accumulated loans and discounts and
yet another moderate cash loss, increasing
the deficit in excess reserves to
almost $2,200,000.
CHICAGO BOARD
CHICAGO, Feb. 18.—Foreign markets
were again the paramount influence
on the Chicago board of trade
today. With Argentine reported
three cents higher on wheat, an exactly
similar net gain was recorded
here. Corn finished unchanged to
quarter cent higher, oats 1½ to 1¼
cent higher and provisions five cents
lower to 7½ cents higher although
cured products made a new high
mark for the season.
Wheat started higher in sympathy
with Liverpool's bullish action on
the Argentine crop estimate of 15,000,000
less bushels this year than
last. Profit-taking operations forced
prices downward and absence of decided
support encouraged shorts to
indulge in their favorite trades. As
a result the Buenos Aires close at a
three cent advance came when the
pit was oversold. The longs made
the most of the chance and the bulge
was continued right up to the final
bell.
Corn was weak in the early trade
but a falling off in country offerings
coupled with a fair export business
and advices that the seaboard interests
were coming to terminal markets
for grain, gave ground for good support.
The close was strong.
Oats were about steady but trade
in them was light.
Provisions were moderately active.
The higher prices for live hogs had
the usual effect but locals and cash
houses were good buyers of lard and
only scattered commission houses
were making offerings in the pit.
The top $10.45 for live hogs was a
new high for the season.
STOCK LETTER
Week’s Review
Furnished By
A. W. COOTE,
Hotel Adams Bldg.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.—The conflicting
course of political developments
at Washington due to proposed
bonus legislation and casement of
money rates here and abroad were
foremost influences of another inclusive
week in the financial markets.
Banking and commercial interests
were divided regarding the advisability
of a sales tax and little
thought seemed to be given to the
question of compensation legislation,
but opposition to a bond issue was
practically unanimous.
Reduction of the Bank of England
discount rate to the level prevailing
at this and other leading federal reserve
districts occasioned no surprise
in view of the sharp rise of sterling
exchange and the very favorable turn
in the British trade balances.
Improved trade and better general
economic conditions were the
reasons given for the further advance
of French, Belgian and Italian currencies.
Buoyancy of neutral exchanges,
especially those on Holland, the other
north European centers suggested
that recent financial tension in those
countries had relaxed.
Interest in the question of Europe’s
war obligations as revised by the
statement of a prominent member of
the French chamber of deputies
(Loucheur) that France cannot pay
her debt to America. Regardless of
this statement, French and other European
underwritings already were
active and strong, trading embracing
the largest number of foreign issues
since the close of the war.
In the stock market, gains predominated
among popular shares, but the
movement lost some of the strength
as a result of profit-taking and resumption
of the bearish operations in
Mexican oils and independent steels.
Industrial conditions were again obscured
by additional price cuts in
fabricated steel and iron, further
slowing down of production in the
automobile and affiliated trades and
fresh labor disturbances at New England
and southern textile centers.
