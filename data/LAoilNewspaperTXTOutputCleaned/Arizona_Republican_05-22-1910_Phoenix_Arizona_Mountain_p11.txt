George King Made Mistake When He
Took Garments Yesterday.

THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 22, 1910.

J. C. King saw a pair of trousers
in the White House clothing store
yesterday afternoon that just suited
him. He was measured and it was
found that the pants had been made
for a man just exactly his build.
But six dollars was a lot of money
to put into a single pair of trousers
just at this time with a long, warm
summer ahead. King said he guessed
he had better wait. He caressed the
trousers fondly as they were placed
back on the top of a pile of other
garments. Then he went out for a
breath of fresh air.

A few minutes later King recalled
that he really needed some socks;
the kind of sox in the box upon
the top shelf where the proprietor of
the store, who was conducting the
business unaided at the time, would
be obliged to climb upon a box to
reach and incidentally turn his back
upon the customer. It was while the
socks were being brought to view that
King possessed himself of the trousers
which were still lying in plain
view.

In possessing himself of the gar-
ments he failed to call the attention
of the proprietor; somehow the head
of the establishment soon learned
that the trousers had disappeared.
A small boy in the rear of the store
said he had
seen the man put the garments under
his coat. Word was sent for an offi
cer and Constable Jim Murphy who
was in the vicinity made a speedy
trip to the White House and soon
had his man in tow. The trousers
were found tucked neatly under his
coat. He will be given a hearing
before Justice Johnstone tomorrow.
SALVAGE OF TINNING PLANT.
The report of the Tin Consolidated
Mining Company gives some
interesting information respecting the
salvage of a smelting works recently
mentioned. The residue of this com-
pany's plant was $12,257. The struc-
tural steel sold to the International
Smelting and Refining Company have
realized $37,177, while machinery and
plant bases bring $4,777. There
is estimated to remain property value
at $17,000, not yet realized.
Against these receipts is the wrecking
and use amounting to $7,000. The
net salvage in this case appears to
amount to a count to a little more than 14 per
cent, which seems to be unjustifiably
high, and is, our experience, explainable
by the fact that the material and
machinery of the plant could be
employed for a new plant, being lo-
cated in the same district in which the
Irish Consolidated is financially in-
terested, this being a condition that
does not ordinarily occur. Engineer-
ing and Mining Journal.

Uncle Sam is Going to Use Them in
His Currency Factory.
Two newly perfected time and labor
saving machines, the invention of
which was brought about by the spur
of continual manufacture of all
forms of paper money.

The combination machine for num-
bering, sealing and separating with
a newly provided adjunct in the form
of a trimming machine, will, accord-
ing to Good's magazine, perform all
the operations of currency manufac-
ture with the exception merely of the
first printing of the face and reverse
of bills.
Under the old plan the individual
numbering machines, the individual
sealing machines had all to be fed by
hand. In the new comprehensive ap-
paratus, however, all the feeding is
done automatically, and inasmuch as a
pile of similar sheets, that is, stamped notes
can be accommodated in the machine
compartment, it will be possible to
operate the machine continuously for
three hours at average speed without
stopping to replenish the supply.
The new combination machine not
only concentrates the operations of a
little shop of machines but it does
things that have not heretofore been
done by any machine. After the num-
bered and sealed bills have been sep-
arated it gathers these bills together
right side up as skilfully and much
more quickly than any human beings
could do it, and ere it passes them out
for the ultimate consumers it counts
them and apportions them in packages
of 1000 something that has heretofore
involved manual labor.
It is expected that by July 1, 1910,
the national government will have ex-
pended about $150,000 for an install-
ation of fifteen of the new combination
machines and $20,000 for forty of the
new style trimmers, but this invest-
ment will be quickly returned for it
is estimated that by the new process
of currency manufacture made possi-
ble by these new machines Uncle Sam
will effect a saving in wages alone
amounting to $50,000 a year.
Considerably more than one hun-
dred employees and seventy machines
will be displaced absolutely and con-
stitute a net gain. Moreover the new
machinery installation will occupy but
a fraction of the floor space of the
old; the allowance for depreciation
and repairs will be proportionately
less; there will be a heavy saving in
the amount of electrical current re-
quired for operation and other inci-
dental economies, all contributing to a
total of really surprising magnitude.
Get your glasses here, then you will
feel better after your summer's vaca-
tion. "Ours fit in every detail."

MR. WILLIAM Y. STEESE.
Mr. William F. Steese, 701 Colburn St,
Akron, Ohio, writes:
Have been troubled for five years with catarrh of the stomach.
Have used different patent medicines to no effect whatever, and have
doctored considerably with family doctor. Sometimes his treatment would re-
lieve me for a few weeks, but would eventually have to go back to him, and
that had kept up for several years.
I was advised to use Peruna, and
have taken three bottles. Never felt
so good in my life. Am going to con-
tinue using it. Wouldn't be with-
out it in the house. I will gladly re-
commend it to any one afflicted with
catarrh of stomach, or stomach trou-
ble of any kind."
The above is an oft-repeated story.
Troubled for years with chronic ca-
tarrh. Tried different remedies and
doctors to no avail. Peruna was ad-
vised by friends. Instant relief expe-
rienced, great gratitude to Peruna
expressed. This in brief, is a story
that is repeated to us a great many
times every year.
No one could be in touch with our
vast correspondence for one month
without being impressed with the sin-
cerity and truthfulness of these kind of
testimonials.
Peruna promptly produces an appe-
tite, corrects digestion and relieves
stomach difficulties that have resisted
other treatment.

MANY WOMEN CANDIDATES
FOR COUNTY OFFICES
Demand Lion's Share of Offices in One
Kansas County.
Women candidates for county offices
will be well represented at the pri-
maries held in Chase county, and it is
likely that no other county in the state
is at present so well represented with
women officeholders and women can-
didates. Up to date three women have an-
nounced themselves as candidates sub-
ject to the decision of the republican
primary in August, and it is likely
that one or two other women will
come out. Those who have already an-
nounced their candidacy are Mrs. Ber-
tha Plummer of Strong City, for the
office of register of deeds; Miss Lasse
Houston of Cottonwood Falls, for clerk
of the district court, and Mrs. Hattie
Smith, also of this city, for register of
deeds.
At present two women are holding
county offices. Four years ago Miss
Anna Arnold was elected county su-
perintendent on the democratic ticket
and was re-elected for her second term
two years ago. At the same time she
was elected her first term, Mrs. Nora
Goodrich was chosen as register of
deeds by the same party and was also
re-elected for her second term two
years ago. A few months ago, how-
ever, in a strenuous campaign waged
with Cupid, Mrs. Goodrich was defeat-
ed, was married to the chairman of
the county democratic central commit-
tee and gave up politics. Mrs. Hattie
Smith was then appointed to fill the
unexpired term and is the present
register of deeds.
Although she has not announced her
self as a candidate for re-election,
County Superintendent Anna Arnold's
friends are urging her to enter the
race and it is said she will likely do
so. She is very popular and two years
ago polled practically every vote in
the county, as there was no opposing
candidate and she had a clear field.
This year there are two men candidates
on the republican ticket who will try
for the nomination for county superin-
tendent. Topeka Capital.

SHE MADE RAPID PROGRESS,
The feminine will out, even in the
case of children. This was amusingly
shown recently when little Caroline,
7 years old, and her brother, 6
years old, were sent to school on the
same day.
For a week they attended regularly,
and on Saturday night the proud
father called them to him. With one
on each knee, he asked what they
had learned in school.
"Well," said the boy. "I learned dat
de worl' is round. I can count up to
five and say my alferbet."
His father beamed, and by careful
questioning got quite a remarkable
amount of knowledge out of his small
son.
"I'm proud of you, Freddie," he
said, smiling. "Now, Caroline, have
you learned lots, too?"
"Uh, huh," answered Caroline shyly.
"Well," encouraged her father, "tell
us what you have learned."
"I learned the names of all the boys
in Freddie's class," she answered
proudly, and wept when her father
laughed.
