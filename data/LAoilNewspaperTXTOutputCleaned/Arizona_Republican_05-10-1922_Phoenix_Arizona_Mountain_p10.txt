FINANCIAL AND MARKET NEWS

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market

NEW YORK. May 9.—Alternate recessions and rallies attended today's session of the stock exchange, an irregular to heavy tone prevailing at the close. The market's scope contracted visibly and total sales again fell slightly under the familiar million share line.
There was less selling pressure among leaders, the occasional reversals apparently resulting more from an absence of buying power than from any concerted efforts of the short interest.
Pools continued their maneuvers in several of the more obscure industrials and specialties, but their operations elicited little or no outside support.
Rails were the day's only substantial features, their rebound in the final hour going far to reduce the average of declines. Sales amounted to 955,000 shares.
Further actual and prospective advances in prices of raw and refined oils were announced, but reports of another upward revision of fabricated iron and steel were not confirmed.
Traders were not inclined to pay much attention to the proposed senate inquiry into the steel merger now under way. The April tonnage report of the United States Steel Corporation will be made public tomorrow. Movements of shares today gave no hint that bookings would show an increase over those disclosed in the March statement. On the lighter inquiry money rates eased, all call loans being made at four per cent.

CHICAGO BOARD
CHICAGO, May 9.—Wheat averaged higher in price today, helped by reports of improved call from domestic millers and by talk of revival of foreign demand. The close, however, was unsettled, %c net lower to 11 %e, advance with May $1.37% to $1.38. and July $1.23% to $1.23%. Corn lots % to %. and oats % to %€#.%•
In provisions the outcome varied from 10c decline to 15 cents advance.
Word that flour business was picking up somewhat came from Minneapolis and Toledo as well as from Chicago millers, and did a good deal to bring about the upward swing which started in the wheat market soon after the opening. There was also some buying of May wheat here for millers who were removing hedges. Gossip about better export business in wheat was based partly on news of European high prices for potatoes. Besides upward of 1,000,000 bushels of wheat, mostly Canadian, were said to have been taken today for Europe at the seaboard.
Crowded condition of elevators here tended to curtail local buying of corn and oats. Assertions that 750,000 bushels of corn had been sold to exporters failed to act as an offset.
Provisions at first had an upward slant in line with hog values, but later weakened somewhat as a result of commission house selling of lard.

STATE MINING NEWS
By Chas. F. Willis, Editor Arizona Mining Journal

Copper Situation; An increasing firmness in the market with a larger price for June delivery marked the copper market for the past week. The leading feature, however, during the past several weeks has been a larger foreign demand, and we must recognize that the future of the copper industry depends largely upon the use of copper abroad. Authorities on export business are confident of the future with a steadily increasing demand, as practically all scrap copper is now consumed.
Jerome: The United Verde Copper company has had orders to start mining and shipping to the smelter. This makes the last of the large copper mines to start, their extremely advantageous financial position enabling them to wait and avail themselves of the better price of the metal.
Crown King: There is an increasing activity in the Crown King section, following closely upon the announcement of the opening of the Humboldt smelter, the Spring Green, Fall-view, Blue Jacket, Springfield, Nelson and other properties are working and preparing for shipping.
Fierro: Shipments have started from the Hanover-Bessemer iron mines at the rate of 15,000 tons per month at the present. This ore goes to the Colorado Fuel and Iron plant at Pueblo, Colo. The working force is now about 100 men, under the direction of L. M. Kniffen, general manager.
Dos Cabezas: S. N. Kemp, the editor of the Copper Review, a financial paper published in New York city, was a visitor at the property of the Central Copper company last week and expressed himself as being quite elated with the showing that has been made in the development of the past months.
Morenci: The detailed plans for the remodeling of the No. 6 concentrator of the Phelps Dodge corporation Morenci branch will be completed about the first of June and forwarded to the New York office for approval. The plans contemplate increasing the capacity of the plant about 1000 tons daily.
Ajo: All possible speed is being made in the water development for the 10,000-ton flotation plant of the New Cornelia Copper company which is to be erected shortly. The development of water is an essential preliminary to the erection of plants in the Ajo district.
Bisbee: Interest is centered in the Chicago meeting of the Shattuck-Arizona Copper company directors, which was held recently in Chicago, as it is presumed that this meeting may mean the starting of this company. Some very high grade ore was encountered just preliminary to then stopping.
Chloride: The Dardanelles is about to resume operations with all new electrical equipment and adequate power to go to a 1000-foot depth. This mine has been well developed in the upper levels and showed some very fine ore bodies and the new equipment will permit of development at depth.
Kingman: Reports from the Nancy Lee show that that property has encountered 14 feet of ore running $15 per ton. This strike, which was reported several weeks ago, is at a 200-foot depth. Progress of the Nancy Lee is being closely watched by financial interests of San Francisco.
Mayer: The United Arizona Mining and Smelting company is keeping its workings clear of water in order that development work may again start on short notice. This property has been developed to a depth of 1000 feet by a shaft and by extensive diamond drill work.
