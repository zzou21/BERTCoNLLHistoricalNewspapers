FOOTBALL POW WOW
CALLED FOR TONIGHT
"Old Doc Jones and Coach Geary Want
to Inject Ginger in High
School Team.
Coach Geary and 'Old Doc Jones are
insistent in their laudable desire to in
ject some ginger and pep into the plays
of the Phoenix high school football
team next year, so they have decided
upon a series of ante-season treatments
for the candidates for positions on the
team. Several of these sessions have
already been held and much good has
come from them in the way of teaching
the youngsters what the game looks
like from the tactical standpoint, in
fact the idea is to give the boys a
knowledge of the game from a scien
tific standpoint first, and then teach
them in the coaching season later, the
practical knowledge of the pastime.
In view therefore of this Coach Geary
has called another 'pow wow' for 8
o'clock tonight at the T. M. C. A.
Coach Geary will give a chalk talk to
night, with the especial intention of
showing how certain positions shall be
played. All the candidates for the
team and 'old boys' who can possibly
be on hand are urged to be present.
School spirit is a great thing and helps
to win games, and an exhibition of
school spirit now while the weather is
warm will help a great deal.

FOREIGN FLAGS
IN THE U.S.A.

Some Information Brought
Out at Tucson by the Removal of the Flag from
the Mexican Consulate
Last Week
A few days ago, either in mischief or with an overcharge of patriotism some boys at Tucson removed the flag from the Mexican consulate there. To
them it appeared inappropriate that a foreign flag should be floating in
American air about Fourth of July time. The matter was regarded as of
so great international moment that representations were made in Wash
ington regarding the episode.
The removal of the flag has brought out some interesting information regarding the status of foreign flags according to the following from the
Arizona Star:
That a consul has no extraterritorial
rights which warrant or justify him
in raising the flag of his nation over
his consular offices unless such a
privilege is especially accorded him
by treaty provision, was the statement yesterday of General Thomas
F. Wilson. While expressing regret
at the hauling down of the Mexican
flag from the office of Alejandro
Ainslie on the morning of the Fourth
of July and rebuking those who com
mitted the act, he says that the
contention of Mr. Ainslie that his
office is Mexican territory is erro
neous. That is an extraterritorial right
that attaches only to the office of
a minister or ambassador, as the
general explains, "by some fiction
of international law."
General Wilson was in the American
consular service about twenty-four
years and his opinion on the status of
a consul is therefore authoritative. He
served as American consul in Brazil,
in China, Hawaii and Canada. As consul to Brazil he figured in the famous "Florida incident"
which came near involving this country with England but out of which
the general came with a promotion
and a substantial increase in salary.
In the same mail with his recall as
consul to the Brazilian port, he re
ceived notice of appointment to the
position of consul-general in Canada.
General Wilson's opinion of the
issue involved in the flag incident of
Friday morning is as follows:
"Under international law, a con
sulate is not a part of the territory of
the country of the consulate. No
such claim is ever made for a con
sulate. A consul cannot fly the flag
of his country over his office or his
residence, or put the consular coat of
arms over the consulate entrance,
without treaty stipulations authoriz
ing it or the consent of the govern
ment in which the consulate is sit
uated. Permission to display the flag or
consular coat of arms is not a matter
of right, though it is usually accorded
and is often provided for by treaty.
Usually all a consular office may
claim is inviolability for the archives
and official property of the office and
their exemption from seizure or ex
amination. A consul has no ex
traterritorial rights. His person is not
exempt from arrest on a criminal
charge, except by treaty stipulations.
"A consul, except by special treaty
stipulations, is merely a commercial
agent of the country which appoints
him. Neither he nor his consulate
has any extraterritorial rights or ex
emptions. An ambassador or minis
ter has extraterritorial rights and pri
vileges which do not belong to a
consul.
"A diplomatic representative by a
fiction of international law is always
supposed to be upon the soil of the
nation of which he is the representa
tive, and that the embassy is a part
of the country he represents, and is
therefore not liable to arrest and the
embassy is inviolable, but no such
exemption attaches to a consulate in
the absence of special treaty stipula
tions, which do not exist between
the United States and Mexico.
"It is not a question as to whether
the Huerta government is recognized
by the United States or not. Usually
the custom has been, out of courtesy
for the Mexican consuls in the United
States and the United States consuls
in Mexico to fly the flags of their
respective countries over their con
sulates, but it is not a right, it is merely
a custom growing out of courtesy.
"The occurrence of such a thing is
very regrettable and is unwarranted
and unjustifiable, as it is not within
the province of a citizen of the
United States to decide when and
where a foreign flag may be displayed
in the United States, as that is a
question which the authorities of the
United States can only decide.
"If a citizen of the United States
feels aggrieved at the display of a
foreign flag in this country, he should
apply to the proper United States
authorities to have it abated and not
attempt to do, individually, that
which pertains solely to the United
States government, otherwise any ir
responsible individual might attempt
to haul down a foreign flag which
might be displayed under treaty au
thority or with the permission of the
United States."

Obstinate Acne
Quickly Yields
Fine Remedy that Clears
Skin of Pimples on Cheeks,
Temples, Sides of Nose
and Chin.
Acne attacks the glandular structure
of the skin, more particularly those
tiny glands that secrete fat.
And it is here that S. S. S., the famous
blood purifier is most active in its
influence.
There is one ingredient in S. S. S., the
purpose of which it is to stimulate the
cells in the tissues that they select
from the blood the nutriment that
makes new skin and thus eliminates
all irritants, acids and parasites that
inflame the glands. There is a natural
tendency of the fine network of blood
vessels in the skin to throw off impuri
ties, but where a persistent inflamma
tory process has invaded the skin, the
natural repair work of the blood is in
terfered with. It requires the stimu
lating activity of S. S. S. to overcome
such morbid conditions. If you have
been troubled with acne, do not despair
of a cure.
You can get S. S. S. in any drug
store, but insist upon having it. The
great Swift Laboratory in Atlanta, Ga.,
prepares this famous blood purifier,
and you should take no chance by per
mitting anyone to recommend a sub
stitute. And if your blood condition is
such that you would like to consult a
specialist freely, address the Medical
Dept., The Swift Specific Company, 181
Swift Bldg., Atlanta, Ga.
