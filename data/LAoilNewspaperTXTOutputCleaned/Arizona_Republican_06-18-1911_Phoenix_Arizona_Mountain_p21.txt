As They Measure in Jersey.
"The wilds of New Jersey," Frank
Maine says, recounts the St. Paul
Dispatch, "reward the explorer well.
If the who sojourn at Atlantic City
or Long Branch would but penetrate
into the wilds they would see and
hear many interesting things.
"Take, for example, the measure
ment of the distance. I once asked
the keeper of the general store in a
New Jersey village choked with sand
to tell how far it was to Skeeter Swamp.
"'Skeeter Swamp,' said the store-
keeper. 'Well, I should say Skeeter
Swamp wuz 'bout two whoops from
here or mebe two whoops and a
holer.'
"I asked a man in Skeeter Swamp
how far Flytown was. The man shift
ed his quid to the left cheek and re
plied 'Flytown, stranger, is about three
chaws to the south unless y're a fast
chawer. Then I'd say it wuz about
three chaws and a half.'"
And Autographed.
It is told that after Professor Ay
toun had made proposals of marriage
to Miss Emily Jane Wilson, daughter
of Christopher North, he was, as a
matter of course, referred to her fa
ther, says Success. As the professor
was uncommonly diffident, he said to
her, "Emily, my dear, you must speak
to the professor on this subject."
"Papa is in the library," said the
lady.
"Then you had letter go to him,"
said the professor, "and I will wait
here."
There being apparently no help for
it, the girl proceeded to the library.
"Papa's answer is pinned to the back
of my dress," Miss Wilson said, as
she re-entered the room.
Turning around, the delighted sui
tor read these words:
"With the author's compliments."
