FINANCIAL AND MARKET NEWS

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market
NEW YORK, Mar. 27.—Only a few
selected issues were immune from
fluctuation in today’s moderately active
and lower stock market. So-called
favorites reacted 1 to 3 points and
some less popular and more speculative
shares suffered greater losses.
Signs of a weakened technical position
and greater discrimination on the part
of investors, together with a falling off
of public interest, provoked an extension
of bearish aggressions, especially in
steels, equipments, oils, motors, sugars
and kindred specialties.
With the progress of the session,
issues of the investment type as well
as junior transportations were singled
out for sporadic attacks. Partial
recoveries in the last hour were due to
bidding up of chain stores and merchandising
issues, together with short covering
in sugars and low-priced oils. Sales
amounted to 775,000 shares.
Incidents over the week-end favored
both sides of the account. The number
of idle freight cars was further reduced
and Western railroad centers reported
a cheerful tone over the trend of business.
Among many February railroad
earnings submitted, those of Atchison,
Louisville & Nashville, Baltimore
& Ohio, Lehigh Valley and New Haven
showed substantial gains in net returns.
Coppers and the general metal
market continued to ignore the increased
foreign inquiry.
Call money held at 4¼ per cent
until the final hour, the rate then
easing to 4 per cent. Relaxed country-wide
monetary conditions were seen in the
lower rediscount rate fixed by the Atlanta
federal reserve bank.
Foreign exchanges were more sensitive
to the further collapse of the German
remittance, the mark declining to the
smallest fraction above 29-100 of one cent.
Sterling fell 1½ cents under last week’s
final quotation and the whole range of
continental bills reacted 2 to 17 points,
Holland, Norway and Denmark being
the most heavy.

CHICAGO BOARD
CHICAGO, Mar. 27. Assertions
that 800,000 acres in Kansas would
not yield half a crop did a great deal
today to bring about higher prices
for wheat. The market closed unchanged
to 1¾ net gain, with May $1.32¾ to $1.33
and July $1.18¼ to $1.18¾. Corn finished
½ to ¾ cent up, and oats up ½ to ¾ cents.
In provisions the outcome varied
from 30 cents decline to 5 cents advance.
Reports of damage by green bugs
in Oklahoma and elsewhere southwest
were also of considerable effect in
turning wheat traders to the bull side
of the market during the last part
of the day. Gossip was current that
more export buying was in progress
than was apparent on the surface,
Germany in particular, it was said,
acquiring title to liberal amounts of
new crop grain for deferred shipment.
Before the advance in the wheat
market took place, much weakness
in prices was shown, the result chiefly
of a decided setback of values at
Liverpool. The extreme decline here
amounted to as much as 10½ cents
in some cases compared with top figures
last week. Subsequent buying was based
partly on opinions that liquidating sales
were at an end for at least the time being.
Corn and oats swayed with wheat.
An unexpected decrease in the visible
supply of corn was a late bullish
factor.
Provisions averaged lower with
hogs.

SCHOOLMASTERS IN
MEETING
The Arizona Schoolmasters' club
held their regular monthly meeting
on Saturday evening, March 23, at the
Creighton school on East McDowell
road. The large dining room of the
school was beautifully decorated with
the school colors of green and gold,
while the flower designs of marigold
and ferns were used for table favors.
The banquet was prepared and served
promptly at 7:15 p. m. by the domestic
science class of the Creighton
school under the direction of their
teacher, Mrs. Love, to 80 members of
the club.
Music for the occasion was furnished
by the Phoenix high school
orchestra under the direction of P.
A. Venue. A social program of the
following numbers was given by the
pupils of the school immediately following
the banquet:
Piano solo (violin acc.)
Margaret Sweet, Wayne Vattelman
Shadow song, trio Ruth
Ames, Rebecca Hurst, Gene Perry
“My Old Irish Mother”
Eighth grade girls' chorus
Reading, “The Schoolmasters’ Dinner” Leland Jarrett
The business meeting was featured
by two splendid reports, one by Supt.
H. E. Hendrix of Mesa on the National
Education meeting at Chicago,
and the other by Supt. J. D. Loper of
Phoenix on the proposed new law
code, dealing specifically with senate
bill No. 43.
Remarks of a character to instill
confidence and courage in the educational
future were made by L. R.
Templin, president of the Creighton
school board; Dr. Dameron of the
Phoenix school; J. J. Gould, president
of the Roosevelt school board: Principal
D. F. Jantzen of the Phoenix
high school and Representative O. D.
Betts of the Glendale school board.
The final meeting of the year will
be subject to the call of the president
of the organization. County School
Superintendent A. L. Jones.

FRAIZ DARVAS
BENEFIT CONCERT
The musicians of Phoenix are
eagerly looking forward to the appearance
of Franz Darvas tomorrow
evening at the Woman's club house,
when he gives a recital for the benefit
of the Caruso American Memorial
foundation, as is evidenced by the
large sale of tickets.
Mr. Darvas, who ranks with the
best pianists of the country, will include
in his program works from the
great masters, Mozart, Beethoven,
Chopin and Liszt.
The program is scheduled for 8:30
o'clock, and it is requested that everyone
be present and seated at that
hour in order to avoid confusion.

SHOULDER STRAPS
Women who wear the chemise
frock often find the shoulder straps
of the chemise appearing above the
neck line of the frock. A clever way
to prevent this is to sew a new
piece of ribbon to the frock at the
shoulder of the frock, pass it under
the shoulder strap of the chemise
and then hook it back to the shoulder
of the dress. Thus the straps are
firmly held out of sight.

INK STAINS
If ink stains have not become 100%
set they can be removed from white
cotton fabric by soaking them in
sour milk.

NOTES FROM THE
JUNIOR COLLEGE
Dr. Stroud, a prominent young physician
of Arizona spoke at the weekly
assembly Wednesday, Mar. 22. He
specializes in toxicology and his talk
was on that subject. He gave the
symptoms and methods of treatment
for the various kinds of poisoning.
His lecture was very interesting as
well as instructive.
At the same assembly J. O. Sexson,
general secretary of the Y. M. C. A.,
spoke. His talk was based on his experiences
while on the state board
of pardons and paroles. He stressed
the importance of congenial home life
and the need of higher education.
The next assembly will be given
Tuesday during the third hour in
the auditorium. The purpose of this
assembly is to advertise the play.
The glee club will sing and several
other snappy numbers will be given.
Tickets for the play, “Country Boys
in College,” went on sale Friday.
Ben Getzinger, advertising manager,
has charge of the tickets. Reservations
may be made Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday. Tickets are 35
and 50 cents.
A prize of $2.50 has been offered
by Dean Carpenter for the best yell
to be turned in before Mar. 31. Mr.
Dykes has offered a similar prize for
the best song turned in by the same
date. Get busy!
The game which was to have been
played at Casa Grande Saturday has
been postponed on account of the
rain there.
The Junior college students greatly
regret the fact that Leo “Dinty”
Moore and James Pepper are leaving
school this week. “Dinty” was commissioner
of athletics and captain of
the baseball team. Pepper was also
a member of the nine.
Mrs. Weston, president of the P. T.
A. of Tucson, visited the P. J. C.
Friday, Mar. 24.
