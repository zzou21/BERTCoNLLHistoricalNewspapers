SHIP ORE AT RATE
OF $4000 A YEAR,
WHILE DEVELOPING
Stepp Bros., Well Known Here, For
Nine Years Have Shipped Lead-
Silver Ore From Their Property
In The Comobabi District, 90
Miles East Of Ajo, And While
Shipping Ore Developing Claims
Into Big Mine.
When the three Stepp brothers,
W. H., C. L. and A. J. Stepp, first
gained control of the Little Mary
mines in the Comobabi district, some
10 years ago, they did not proceed
with the usual method of operating
their prospect from a Tucson street
corner in pursuit of a forlorn hope
that some interested party with
money might happen along. These
enterprising men rustled a grubstake
and a few digging implements and
undertook to develop their mine
themselves.
That was something more than
nine years ago, and today after con
tinuous work, ore to the value of
$40,000 has been mined, shipped
and sold by the brothers. This out
put, which represented only the
high grade ore taken from the Little
Mary, was sorted by hand and haul
ed to Tucson for smelter shipment in
wagons. In addition to the ore sold
there are now between 1,400 and 1,-
500 tons of high grade milling ore
on the dump, which was rejected by
the brothers as it was too low grade
for hand picking.
Since they started work at the Lit
tle Mary, the Stepp boys have com
pleted over 600 feet of development

work, and they recently opened up
a “big vein” on which they have
stripped a 300-foot ore shoot on the
surface of the ground. This big
vein runs parallel to the “Chicago”
vein, from which the brothers have
been shipping ore during their years
of work, and while the newly open
ed vein does not contain ore of the
same high grade as the smaller ledge
its ore deposit ranges from four to
15 feet in width, the brothers say.
The smaller vein has a width of from
two to four feet, and its ore has
averaged a little better than $100 a
ton, smelter returns. Limited ship
ments have been made from the big
vein whose tonnage valuation is
about $62.
No more ore than has been need
ed to cover operating expenses and
provide grub money has been pulled
by the brothers from the Little
Mary and every dollar of profit has
been put back into the property on
improvements with a result that the
mine is now equipped with modern
machinery including a two-drill air
machine, a 40-horse power hoist and
other modern apparatus. Several
buildings have also been erected at
the mine, which presents a business
like appearance.
The highest mineral content of the
Little Mary are lead and silver, al
though both copper and gold help
to swell the size of the smelter
checks. The net smelter returns last
year amounted to something more
than $4200, although considerable
time was spent during this year in
relocating the vein, which had been
lost through contacting a fault. Fif
ty feet of digging was required be-

didn’t.
The home boys fell on Joe, the

the seventh (4 runs). In three in
nings Ajo was held scoreless.
Four Ajoites—Hager, Wheeler,
Russell and A. Guinn—tied for first
place in stick work, each getting
four hits out of five times at bat.
But, number of bases counting,
Hager leads with a total of nine
bases (two 3-baggers, one 2-bagger
and a single). Russell comes next
with six bases to his credit. Hager
also leads in runs—4.
Ajo’s battery—Roy Guinn, H.
Guinn and Grier—showed up well.
Hits for Ajo—Patterson 2, Heyl
1, Hager 4, Wheeler 4, Russell 4.

fore the vein was again discovered.
While as many as 15 men have
been worked at the Little Mary at
times the brothers are now working
a force of six men. The brothers are
contemplating the purchase of a
small flotation mill for the handling
of the ore in the big vein and that
on the dump.
As their only home during the
last decade has been at the Little
Mary, the brothers have decided to
establish a home in Tucson in order
that they will have a comfortable
place to live during their frequent
trips to Tucson.

BEN LOMOND INV. CO.
TO MAKE SHIPMENTS
VIA R. R. AT AJO
A. J. Pidgeon, general manager of
the Ben Lomond Investment com
pany, was in the city a few days ago,
and after visiting the property, 60
miles east of Ajo, went to Tucson
on business.
It is expected that the mill will
be started up the last of the month.
Shipments by rail—both in and
out—will be made via Ajo and the
T. C. & G. S., according to Manager
Pidgeon.
Recent shipments arriving by rail
and going out to the mine, where a
100-ton mill was recently completed,
include a car of oil and 24,000 lbs.
of grinding balls.
The major portion of the equip
ment for the mill also came this
way, the consignments including two
carloads of machinery and four cars
of lumber.
Plant Cost $70,000
The new mill, which is declared
a handsome one and up-to-date in
every way, cost $70,000, being one
of 100 tons capacity. It contains
three cyanide tanks and a 100-H. P.
engine.
The principal values are gold.
The operators are V. W. Brooks
and associates of Los Angeles.

OIL STRUCK AT 720
FT. IN NEW BOWIE WELL
By express Friday, Earl Steele re
ceived from F. L. Copening of Bowie
a bottle of oil struck at a depth
of 720 ft. in the standard well be
ing put down by the Bowie-San
Simon Oil syndicate, 4 miles east of
Bowie.
Those who saw it and are more
or less familiar with oil say it looks
like about 18 gravity, and Ajoites
interested in land and leases in the
San Simon valley are naturally much
pleased—also very hopeful of re
sults on gaining greater depth.
At various times, there have been
reports of the finding of a little oil
in wells around Bowie at a depth of
750 ft., so the result in the new
well is not surprising.
