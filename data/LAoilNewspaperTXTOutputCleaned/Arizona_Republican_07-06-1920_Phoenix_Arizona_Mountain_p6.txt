Roper Outpoints
Martin in Fast
10-Round Battle

AKRON, Ohio, July 5. Captain Bob
Roper outpointed Bob Martin, cham
pion of the American expeditionary
forces, in a fast 12-round contest here
today, according to ringside critics.
Both tried hard for a knockout but
neither was able to land the decisive
blow. Roper won chiefly because he
repeatedly beat Martin to the punch. In
the third he drew blood and from then
on was hammering Martin in the face.
Martin's body blows at times were
most terrific and Roper cautiously
covered his midriff through most of the
contest.
The first, fifth and twelfth rounds
were even. Martin had the advantage
in the second, fourth and eighth but
the other six were Roper's.
Roper's weight was announced at
181; Martin's 185.

TO THE MUSEUM, BOYS
(Cleveland Plain Dealer)
Denver The Colorado state museum
has a new exhibit that is being viewed
with longing eyes and watery lips.
It is a bottle of champagne of an
cient vintage.
Along with relics of Colorado cave
dwellers and pagan collections from
the old world, the bottle of sparkling
beverage is carefully guarded.
The champagne is a souvenir of pio
neer days, having been brought across
the plains in a prairie schooner for a
banquet given by Denver citizens to
members of the 1868 territorial legis
lature.

'Cause they'll have you in their records,
And there is no use to pout;
For your finger prints will queer you.

Tornado Razes House
FLORENCE R. E. Hibbs was
picked up, bruised and starving, in a
desert between Florence and Casa
Grande early yesterday morning by his
son, J. R. Hibbs of Tucson, and Dr.
Butler of the Arizona hospital of
Tucson.
Dr. Butler was driving from Casa
Grande to Florence, accompanied by
young Hibbs, who was intending to
visit his father who is a homesteader
east of Casa Grande. Upon arrival at
the homestead the house was found to
be demolished and scattered over the
ground about 75 feet from its original
location and Hibbs was lying under a
mesquite tree nearby. When questioned,
the elder Hibbs stated that during a
windstorm Tuesday he and the house
were picked up bodily by the tornado
and buried through the air. Blade-Record.
Man Struck By Lightning
DOUGLAS Sam Wynn, employee of
F. L. Knornschild of the Arizona Meat
company, and resident of Cochise
county and Douglas for the past 25
years, is lying at the point of death
in the county hospital as the result of
a stroke of lightning, said to have
struck him at Slaughter's ranch 15
miles northwest of Douglas.
While going to the Slaughter ranch
on business for Mr. Knornschild, he
is said to have run into a small elec
trical storm which resulted in the dis
aster. When struck by lightning, he
was riding a horse, which was killed
instantly and fell on Mr. Wynn, who
had been knocked unconscious by the
stroke. Mr. Wynn sustained serious
injuries to his head, although a local
physician says there is grave danger
are probable internal injuries received
when the horse fell on him. He is said
to have lain under the horse from 3 to
6:30 o'clock, when he was found by Mr.
Knornschild. International.

were bound over to await the action
of the superior court on the charge of
murder. The killing resulted following
a gambling game at White City in
which the dead man shot another
negro, a soldier named King, also. His
comrades are claimed to have killed
the civilian in a spirit of revenge,
although investigation by officers
proved the motive was robbery. The
case will probably come up at the July
term of court. Prospector.

Shows Supreme Nerve
BISBEE Arrested on a complaint
sworn to by James Brophy, charging
the issuance of a bad check for $25,
William Frazer, a miner, when ar
raigned in the justice court at Lowell
yesterday, exhibited an inordinate
amount of nerve when he calmly asked
Brophy to go on his bond for $200.
Brophy indignantly declined, much to
the amusement of all in the court room.
Frazer plead guilty to the charge and,
for lack of anybody to stand respon
sible for his bond, was forced to return
to jail until such a time as his trial
is set. Daily Review.
To Sink Second Oil Well
MIAMI H. B. Lawrence, well known
in the mining districts of the South
west, has completed an organization
of some of the leading business men
of the Gila valley for the purpose of
putting a second rig in that field for
oil exploration. Mr. Lawrence left
Thursday for Los Angeles, where he
will remain about a month on business
in connection with the new company.
He expects to obtain while on the coast
all the equipment necessary for sinking
a well.
Mr. Lawrence has been successful in
both mining and oil enterprises and is
enthusiastic over what the valley has
to offer as a potential oil field.

Fire Destroys Resort
GLOBE. The dance hall and all
buildings at Midland City with the ex
ception of the bath house and the
grandstand at the baseball park were
destroyed in a fire which started this
morning about 1 o'clock. Manager
Scholl who was called to the scene of
the blaze estimated the loss at $30,000,
of which $5,000 is covered by insurance.
All of the main buildings were leveled
to the ground by the blaze.
The origin of the fire is believed to
have been in the kitchen of the Paris
Cafe, according to Lee Poland, who
resides just across the road from the
place. He states that he noticed one
the chimney projecting up from the
roof of the kitchen was red hot about
1:00 a. m. He states that shortly after
this the flames seemed to sweep across
the entire building and that in a space
of a few minutes the entire group of
buildings were in flames. Arizona

Endorses Open Shop
TUCSON. By a vote of 76 to 13, the
Open Shop movement in Tucson was
endorsed by the Tucson chamber of
commerce at a special meeting of the
entire membership last night. The
endorsement was given in the form
of a motion that the chamber of com
merce advocate the principles of the
Tucson Open Shop association, except
that the body would not go on record
as declaring against strikes.
The balloting was preceded by ad
dresses by W. R. Ramsdell, candidate
for the United States senate, and Roy
Morgan of the Central Trades and
Labor Council. Both urged the chamber
to vote down the declaration of
principles.
James R. Dunseath, chairman of the
legislation committee placed the mat
ter before the body in the form of a mo
tion that the principles of the Open
Shop movement as advocated by the
Tucson Open Shop association be ap
proved and adopted by the Tucson
chamber of commerce and receive from
it the moral support of the entire mem
bership, provided that no funds of the
chamber of commerce be expended in
advancing these principles. Daily Star.

Aguirre, a girl being the inspiration,
it is further alleged, for Dan receiving
the bawling out via mail. The battle
was fairly well under way when the
police department butted in and
spoiled it. After explaining to Judge
F. E. Arthur this morning, a peace
treaty was signed without reservations
accompanied by fifteen bucks per each

(By Cora Moore, New York's Fashion
Authority)
NEW YORK A touch of silver lace,
a bit of silver ribbon, a length or cutely
two of silver ribbon is an ideal addi
tion to a summer frock, for the very
tone of silver suggests coolness, as red
suggests warmth.
So, then, there is a hint worth fol
lowing in this dance frock which was
recently seen on the Capitol stage. Its
material is soft, satin-surfaced silk with
a shimmer that makes you think
of the sea when the day is dull, and
it is embroidered in silver, very deli
cately, in a rose spray pattern.
Set in, in front, panel-fashion, is a
flounce of silver lace over tulle, the
latter scalloped and the edges bound
with silver ribbon exactly matching
the tint of the silver in the embroidery
and lace. Straps of silver ribbon hold
