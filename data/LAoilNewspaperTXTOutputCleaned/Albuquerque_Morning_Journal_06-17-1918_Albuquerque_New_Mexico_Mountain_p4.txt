in the methods of removing the

transporting them to hospitals. So effective
the co-operation between
surgeons and physicians at the front
and those at the hospitals in the rear,
that an immensely larger proportion
of the wounded recover, than was the
case at the beginning of the war.
Men whose legs or arms have been
fractured by shells now are restored
to their regiments in a minimum of
time. This is due mostly to the
fact that they receive prompt antiseptic
treatment and surgical attention
which prevents blood-poisoning and
the stiffening of articulation. Their recovery
is rapid and the hospitals behind the lines where they can be treated under comfortable conditions far
from the nerve-racking sound of the
guns.
Soldiers Have Confidence.
Soldiers have been inspired with
confidence in the army surgeons in
the great battles around Verdun and
in the great German offensive which
began in March.
Promptness in the treatment of
wounded men has been obtained by
segregating them in classes according
to the nature of their wounds. This
was not generally done at the beginning
of the war. The plan then in
vogue was to erect large temporary hospitals
as near the fighting lines as possible, but
the hospital ship Samoa was sunk six hours later.
Bay ten or twelve miles from the front. Then or wounded men would
drive only to find all the beds occupied and that they must move on to another hospital.
Most of this difficulty now has been
overcome. When wounded men reach
the first dressing station or field ambulance
they are divided into categories. Those slightly wounded are
rapidly dressed and sent to convalescent
hospitals. Those crippled are
sent to crippled depots. Men who have
been gassed to special hospitals and
those most dangerously wounded are
transferred to hospitals nearby to remain
until they recover or die.
GIVEN PROMPT TREATMENT.
Those suffering from severe but not
dangerous wounds receive prompt
treatment in the advanced ambulances
where operations are performed and
wounds disinfected before the men
are sent to permanent hospitals.
By these divisions of the wounded
into classes, it is asserted that great
rapidity of surgical intervention is
achieved, as each specialist deals only
with cases needing his kind of skill.
Then the patient is removed to the
hospital at a distance of not more than
a journey of ten or twelve hours,
where he receives attention from another
specialist working in close co-
operation with his colleague in the
advanced ambulance.
The system of segregation of
wounded and co-operation of doctors
is said to have produced marvelous
results.
MINNESOTA MAN TO BE
PASTOR OF CHURCH HERE
The Rev. Richard D. Orton of
Olencoe, Minn., will become pastor of
the Congregational church here August 1. Mr. Orton was asked by a
committee, acting for the congregation,
to fill the pulpit here several
weeks ago. His answer accepting the
offer was only received by the Rev. J.
H. Heald, chairman of the committee,
yesterday, however. The salary asked
by Mr. Orton was granted by the
church members at a meeting yesterday
morning.
Mr. Orton is a graduate of Northland
college, Wisconsin and a graduate
of the Chicago theological seminary.
London, June 16. The official
communication from Field Marshal
Haig tonight say there is nothing of

special interest to report on the western
front.
JUDGE IN FAVOR
OF EXTRA SESSION
OF LEGISLATURE

When asked if he favored an extra
session of the state legislature,
Judge G. A. Richardson of Roswell,
who was in Albuquerque last night
answered in the affirmative.
"An extra session of the legislature
should have been called several
months ago," said Judge Richardson,
"for the purpose of endorsing by resolution
our war policies. New Mexico
should declare upon this.
"An act should be passed extending
the elective franchise to the New
Mexico men in all branches of military
service outside of the state. A sedition
law modeled somewhat after the
....... should be enacted too," he
continued, "to safeguard the civil
rights of the soldiers of this state. An
amendment to the present elective
law should be made to make the ballot
more secret and carry out what
was really the intention of the legislature
in reference to the secret ballot. These should be specified in governor's call and the whole work should
be done in one week."
Judge Richardson left last night for
Roswell to open court.

and kept the lead until the end, although
they were at no time sure

The work of D. Chaves, left fielder
of the Highland Sluggers, who pitched
for the Browns, was a feature of the
game. He struck out eighteen men

three-bagger of the game in the third
inning, bringing home two men who

apot is because Miss Durack selected

her own chaperon when she sailed
for America instead of consulting the
A. S. A. about it.
According to rumors filtering in
from the coast, where Miss Durack
is to land, the Australian speed wonder
insisted on bringing her sister to
America as a chaperon, while the A. S.
A. was equally insistent that she bring
someone invested with amateur authority,
whatever that is.
For this reason the A. S. A. has
cabled the A. A. U. that it considers
that the highest standards of amateurism
cannot be maintained if Miss Durack
is permitted to compete here.
Of course it appears that some
member of the A. S. A. wanted a little
joy ride to the states and succeeded
in convincing his associates that Miss
Durack should be made the goal
when he did not get it.
Pending the arrival of the letter,
which it is said, will explain the situation,
it is likely the A. A. U. will
refuse to sanction Miss Durack's appearance
here in authorized competition. The situation would be grievous if it
were not so ridiculous.
American swimmers have been
preparing for months for the arrival of
the champion. Half a dozen of the
greatest mermaids are ready to try to
take her measure in all events from
fifty yards to a mile, in all of which
events Miss Durack now holds international
records.
It will be her first appearance in
America, although she has toured in
England, Scotland, Sweden, Germany,
New Zealand and Australia. Her
greatest swimming was achieved in
the Olympic games at Stockholm in
1912 where she defeated all comers
and hung up a bunch of records that
other girls have been shooting at ever
since.
Miss Durack is 23 and is said to
imitate the swimming strokes of Duke
Kahanamoku.
Her records are impressive from
her 1 minute, 11 seconds for the 100
yards to 20 minutes, 8 seconds for the
mile.
ALEXA STIRLING AND

Miss Stirling started well, halving
the first hole in par four, with Jones,
and she aided her side by winning the
tricky eighth hole in par three. This
kept her and Adair within two points
of their opponents, Jones' 1 on the
first nine. The national woman champion
scored a birdie four on the long
twelfth and won two points for her
side. Miss Rosenthal beat her partner
on the tenth, thirteenth and fifteenth
holes, halving the tenth for her side,
winning the thirteenth but losing the
fifteenth.

NEW PENSION LAW
RECENTLY PASSED
FULLY EXPLAINED
BY SPECIAL COMMUNICATION TO MORNING JOURNAL
Washington, June 16. Congressman
W. D. Walton is in receipt of a
communication from the commissioner
of pensions relative to the new pension
law just passed which will undoubtedly
be of interest to the civil war veterans
of New Mexico. The commissioner's
letter is as follows:
"The act of June 10, 1918, amending
the Sherwood pension law of May 11,
1912, provides the rate of $30 per
month for soldiers and sailors of any
state who served ninety days and less
than six months during the civil war and
were honorably discharged, and who
are now receiving a lower rate. Those
who are 72 years of age, or over, and
who served six months, are entitled
to receive $32 per month; those who
served one year, $35 per month; one
and one-half years, $38 per month,
and two years or over, $40 per month.
These increases will be granted automatically
and without application of
any kind to the pension bureau, to all
soldiers and sailors now pensioned
under the act of May 11, 1912, and
who have attained the required age
and served the necessary length of
time.
Soldiers and sailors who served during
the civil war, and are pensioned
at lower rates under some other
law, but who are entitled to pension
under the act of May 11, 1912, will be
required to file an application under
that act in order to receive the benefits
of the new law.
The pension bureau will make these
allowances with all the dispatch possible
under existing conditions. A
special force for the adjustment of
cases within the provisions of the new
law has been organized, which will
handle these cases exclusively. It
should be borne in mind by those
concerned that there are now nearly
288,000 pensioners under the act of
May 11, 1912, and all are urged to exercise
patience and consideration.
While every effort will be made to
hasten this work, there will be no
avoidable interference with the progress
of claims now on file or hereafter
filed under other laws. A special effort
will be made to not interfere
with the adjudication of widow's
claims.
It will be wholly impracticable to
make any payments at the increased
rate on July 4, 1918; but it is hoped
that payments due August 1, 1918,
may be made at the rate provided by
the new law. It will not be necessary
to write to the bureau about these increases.
Letters of inquiry will simply delay the work of making allowances."
