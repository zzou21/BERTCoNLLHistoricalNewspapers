"LION"
COMBINATION

Poultry

Fencing

Page "Lion" Combination Poultry and Stock Fencing
shown above is sufficiently close spaced to answer
every demand of the poultryman and strong enough
to protect the yard against domestic stock. High
carbon coil spring steel marginal and line wires
prevent Page "Lion" Fences from sagging. The Lion
Knot firmly grips the stay and line wires, with two
points of contact on the stay wires and three on the
line wires, absolutely preventing slipping; in fact
any pressure on the stay or line wire only tightens
the knot's grip more securely. We carry Page
"Lion" Fencing for every purpose. Call and see it.
