THE

METHODS OF BUSINESS
MUST CONFORM TO

President Taft Informs Those Timorous Captains of
Industry To Whom Business Is Above Law
HIS LINCOLN DAY SPEECH AT NEW YORK CITY

In the Party Pledges Which Are Being Redeemed
There Was No Promise to Legalize Operations of
Trusts and Monopolies The President Again Defends
Tariff Law Which Has Been Misrepresented By Its
Opponents and Will Be Further Misrepresented

New York, Feb. 12 "If the enforcement of the law is not consistent with
the present method of carrying
business, then it does not speak well
for the present methods of conducting
business, and they must be changed to
conform to the law."
This was President Taft's answer to
Wall Street and its cry of a "panic."
It was made to a cheering audience of
hundreds of prominent Republicans
gathered tonight at the annual Lincoln
Day dinner of the Republican club in
this city at the Waldorf Astoria.
Mr. Taft adhered to his purpose of
discussing platform pledges and how
they should be kept. It was at the
conclusion of a detailed argument as
to how the Republican party is re
deeming its pledges that he came to
the discussion of the anti-trust law
and Wall Street, on which his utter
ances had been awaited with the
greatest interest.
NO RUNNING AMUCK.
The president declared that the ad
ministration "would not foolishly run
amuck in business and destroy values
just for the pleasure of doing so."
"No one," he continued, "has the mo
tive as strong as the administration
in power, to cultivate and strengthen
business confidence and prosperity.
But there was no promise on the part
of the Republican party to change the
anti-trust law except to strengthen it.
Of course the government at Wash
ington can be counted on to enforce
the law in the best way calculated to
prevent a destruction of public confi
dence in business, but that it must
enforce the law goes without saying."
President Taft did not hesitate to
discuss the attacks that have been
made upon the administration and the
party or the danger to its future suc
cess in the insurgent movement and
other dissensions.
Republicans who feared defeat at
the polls in November, he declared,
however, should take courage from
the demoralized condition of their op
ponents, the Democrats. "It was
Grant," said the president, "who ban
ished his own fear in battle by think
ing how much more afraid the enemy
was."
Mr. Taft again came to the defense
of the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill. He
did not hesitate, he said, to repeat that
it substantially complied with the par
ty pledge for tariff regulation and that
through this bill, the party had "set
itself strongly in the right direction
toward lower tariff."
REDEMPTION OF PLEDGES.
Reviewing the party platform the
president spoke of postal savings
banks, the amendments to the inter
state commerce law, the anti-injunction plank, statehood for Arizona and
New Mexico, and the conservation of
natural resources, bills to carry all of
which promises into effect were pend
ing in congress, and he believed would
be passed.
The president paid in part: "I am
far from saying that the Republican
party is perfect. No party which has
achieved such power as it has achieved
for the last seventeen years could
be expected to maintain either within
its rank and file or in its management,
men of the purest and highest mo
tives, and I am the last one to advo
cate any halt in the prosecution and
condemnation of Republicans, however
prominent and powerful, whose con
duct requires criminal or other pros
ecution and condemnation.
"It should be well understood that
with the Republican party in its pres
ent condition, with its various divi
sions, subjected to the cross-fire of its
own newspapers and its own factions,
any halt or failure on the part of those
in authority to punish and condemn
corruption or corrupt methods will
properly be visited upon the party it
self, however many good men it con
tains."
DEFENSE OF TARIFF.
"We shall be called upon to respond
to the charge in the next campaign
that the tariff, for which we are re
sponsible, has raised prices. If people
listen to reasonable arguments it will
be easy to demonstrate that high
prices proceed from an entirely dif
ferent cause than the present tariff,
which, being largely a revision down
ward, except with respect to silks and
liquors, which are luxuries, cannot be
charged with having increased any
prices.
"But this will not prevent our Dem
ocratic friends from arguing on the
principle of 'post hoc propter hoc':
that because high prices followed the
tariff, therefore they are the result of
it? We must not be blind to the
weight of such an argument in an
electoral campaign.

THE REASON FOR THE RISE IN THE
cost of necessities can easily be trac
ed to an increase in our measure of
values, the precious metal, gold, and
possibly in some cases, to combinations
in restraint of trade.
"The question of the tariff must
be argued out. The prejudices creat
ed by early attacks on the bill and
gross misrepresentations of its char
acter, must be met by a careful pre
sentation of the facts as to the con
tents of the bill and also as to its
actual operation and the statistics
shown thereby.
I believe we have a strong case if
we can only get into the minds of
the people. Should disaster follow
us and the Republican majority in the
house become a minority in the next
house, it may be possible that in the
Democratic exercise of its power, the
people of this country will see which
is the party of accomplishment, which
is the party of arduous deeds done,
and which is the party of words and
irresponsible opposition."
A WORD TO WALL STREET.
"I only want one more word. From
time to time attacks are made on the
administration on the ground that its
policy tends to create a panic in
Wall Street and to disturb business.
All I have to say upon that subject
is this: That certainly no responsible
government like ours would foolishly
run amuck in business and destroy
values and confidence just for the
pleasure of doing so. No one has a
motive as strong as the administration
in power to cultivate and strengthen
business and business prosperity.
"But it does rest with the national
government to enforce the law and
if the enforcement of the law is not
consistent with present methods of
carrying on business, then it does
not speak well for the present meth
ods of conducting business and they
must be changed to conform to law.
"There was no promise on the part
of the Republican party to change
the anti-trust law except to strengthen
it or to authorize monopoly and sup
pression of competition and control
of prices, and those who looked for
ward to such a change cannot now
visit the responsibility for their mis
take on innocent persons.
THE LAW WILL BE ENFORCED.
"Of course, the government at
Washington can be counted on to
enforce the law in the way best
calculated to prevent the disturbance
of public confidence in business, but
that it will enforce the law goes
without saying.
"I am glad to be present and meet
your distinguished governor whose
name is such a power with the people
of this state and of the country that
to lose him for a candidate for gov
ernor by his voluntary withdrawal
is to lose the strongest asset the
Republican party has in the state, to
enable it to win at the next elec
tion."
OTHER SPEECHES.
Governor Hughes made an address
in which he said: "The American people
are fair enough to recognize a great
president filling a great position and
doing his duty with absolute fidelity.
For that reason Mr. Taft will be re
nominated and re-elected."
Governor Fort of New Jersey, said:
"There is room in the Republican
party for advanced thinking. Senator
Dolliver, Senator Nelson and Senator
Beveridge are not thoughtless men.
They know their people and they are
familiar with conditions in the middle
west. They are only a little in ad
vance of the rest of us, but they
are no more so than was Lincoln
in his Springfield speech in 1858."
Speaker Cannon had been expected,
but sent a letter of regret, which said
in part: "Your president and mine
who is with you tonight, is a worthy
successor to Lincoln, and he is called
upon to exercise some of the patience
that characterized Lincoln's adminis
tration, especially in your great me
tropolis, where extremes in advice
are always in evidence and particu
larly so at the present time."
WADING IN NEW YORK POLITICS
President Taft sitting for an hour
and a half today in conference with
the Republican state leaders, showed
much concern in the latest scandal
the Conger-Allds bribery charge at
Albany, and in departing confided
to his intimates that the situation
looked very bad.
The president thus passively, at
least, waded into the troublous whirl
pool of New York state Republican
politics, brought to an acute stage
of late by charges of bribery by one
state senator against another.
The conference was held at the

New York residence of Lloyd C. Gris
com, former ambassador to Italy, but
recently elected president of the New
York Republican county committee,
succeeding Herbert Parsons. Besides
the president and Mr. Griscom, were
present: Timothy L. Woodruff, state
chairman; Senator Depew, Governor
Hughes, James W. Wadsworth,
speaker of the state assembly, and
Otto Bannard.
The discussion centered almost
solely on the Allds-Conger case, in
volving two leading proposals:
Whether the party should investigate
to the limit, or if possible, smother it.
The consensus of opinion appeared to
be to probe to the bottom regardless
of results.
There had been a rumor that a
demand had been made for the res
ignation of State Chairman Wood
ruff. Mr. Woodruff asked about this,
said: "We talked about nothing but
the Allds case. No call was made
upon me to resign and you can quote
me as saying so. I will not say that
I shall conduct the next campaign,
but I shall be chairman until the next
state convention."

THE NAME OF TAFT
SUFFICIENT SLOGAN.
Dayton, Ohio, Feb. 12- John T.
Hays Hammond, president of the Na
tional League of Republican
Clubs, was the principal speaker at
the banquet of the Ohio
League of Republican Clubs. He
declared that he had found from in
vestigation that the grievances
existing in the ranks of the re-
publican party were petty, not fun
damental, more imaginary
than real.
He continued: "The name of
William Howard Taft of Ohio
supplied enthusiasm for the cam
paign work of our clubs in
the recent national election. The
name of President Taft and the poli
cies for which he stands will
supply the National League of Re
publican Clubs the requisite en
thusiasm for effective service
wherever the Republican party's
supremacy is threatened."

THE LOSS OF A LINER
IN STRAITS OF MAGELLAN
MOST OF THE PASSENGERS
TAKEN OFF.
But Eighty-Eight Were Abandoned to
Their Fate.
Santiago, Chile, Feb. 12. The Pacific
Navigation Company's steamer Lima is
ashore on one of the islands of
Huambiin passage in the Straits of
Magellan, and probably will be a total
loss. The chief pilot and eighty passen
gers were drowned.
The British steamer Haturnet res
cued 203 of the persons aboard the
steamer, and was forced to leave eighty
whom it was impossible to save.
SURVIVORS BROUGHT IN.
Ancud, Chile, Feb. 12. The British
steamer Strathurst arrived here with
158 men and women and seventeen of
the crew of the steamer Lima, which
is on the rocks in West Huambiin
passage, in the Straits of Magellan,
where the steamer went aground in a
storm on February 6. The steamer
officials report having left eighty-eight
persons aboard the Lima, their rescue
being impossible. There is no drinking
water, the tanks having burst. The
first mate of the Lima and fifty
passengers were drowned.
There seems some doubt, according
to the dispatches, from Santiago and
Ancud respectively, as to the steam
er which rescued 203 persons from the
stranded liner. The Haturnet is giv
en in the shipping register, while the
steamer Strathurst is not listed there.
The stranded steamer is a British
vessel owned in Liverpool and plying
between that port and ports in South
America. It was last reported as sail
ing from Bahia Blanca, Argentina,
January 26, and was en route to Chilean
and Peruvian ports.
The Lima is 401 feet long, registers
3,113 tons. It was built at Glasgow
in 1907. The place where the steamer was
wrecked probably was Humblane
passage, located between the south
shore of San Pedro island and Chile.
It is a narrow passage, full of dangers
and difficult of navigation. Humblane
rocks, two in number, sixty-five feet
high, mark the entrance to the passage.

STRAPPED IN CHAIR
BABE BURNED TO DEATH
The Mother Had Gone After a Pail of
Water.
Bakersfield, Feb. 12. Strapped in a
high chair in his home, little Joseph
Alexander Malins was burned to death
in a fire which destroyed his home last
night. The charred body of the infant
was dragged from the flame-swept
house by a neighbor after Mrs. Malins
had been severely burned in an at
tempt to rescue the child, after the
father had dashed into the house, and
blinded by smoke, returned with only
an empty chair, and after several
neighbors had made futile attempts to
reach the tot.
The fire was caused by the explo
sion of an oil lamp, not ten minutes
after Mrs. Malins had left her home
to get a pail of water.

OR POISON

IN STOMACHS
Of Late Heirs To the Estate of Col. Swope
ALWAYS HYDE'S CAPSULES
Preceded Convulsions With
Which the Victims Were
Seized Statement of At
torney Paxton in Slander
Suit Deposition
Kansas City, Feb. 12. That Mison
had been found in the contents of the
stomach of Miss Margaret H. Swope,
that Chrisman Swope went into con
vulsions, according to Miss Houlihan,
his nurse, a few minutes after she
had given him a capsule at the direc
tion of Dr. B. C. Hyde, were two
startling statements made under oath
by John G. Paxton, executor of the
Swope estate, today.
These new and important features
in the Swope mystery were revealed
by Mr. Paxton only after he had been
threatened with commitment if he re
fused to answer questions asked him
by Frank P. Walsh, Dr. Hyde's attor
ney. Mr. Paxton was giving his depo
sition in the slander suit for $10,000
brought against him by Dr. Hyde.
Miss Swope was a niece of the late
Col. Thomas H. Swope. On December
1 she was stricken with typhoid fever
and Dr. Hyde cared for her. "Poison
was found in marked quantities in the
contents of Miss Swope's stomach by
Dr. Victor Vaughn," said Mr. Paxton.
Attorney Walsh eagerly demanded
of the witness: "Did anyone tell
you of any medicine that Dr. Hyde
gave Chrisman Swope?"
"I do not remember the exact
words," answered Mr. Paxton, "but
Miss Houlihan told me that Dr. Hyde
had given her a capsule to give to
Chrisman Swope. She gave it to him
and a few minutes later he went into
convulsions."
The story of the stormy scene in
the Swope homestead on Dec. 18, when
the nurses threatened to leave if Dr.
Hyde was not dismissed and another
physician obtained to care for the ill
members of the family, was told by
Mr. Paxton. He told of the vague
suspicions of the nurses which even
tually led up to the open break be
tween them and Mrs. Logan Swope.
It appeared that Miss Houlihan was
the leader of the insurrection. Just
before leaving she turned to Mrs.
Swope, according to Mr. Paxton, and
said: "People are being murdered in
this house."
The departure of Dr. Hyde and his
wife from the home followed amid a
tearful scene. Accusations were made
regarding the physician. His wife, in
the house of her mother, stood firmly
by him as he was turned away from
her parental doors.
Much time was passed in question
ing Mr. Paxton regarding a letter he
wrote to Stewart S. Fleming, one of
the Swope heirs, telling him of the
mystery. It was upon this letter that
Dr. Hyde brought suit.
"Whom did you mean when you said
in this letter that the murderer of
Col. Swope should be brought to Jus
tice?" he was asked.
"I meant Dr. Hyde," said Mr. Pax
ton.

a suit brought by the government
against George Foster Peabody, the
banker and financier of New York, on
a judgment for $343,000 with interest
from January, 1899, was filed in the
federal court today. The suit is based
upon the alleged conversion by Pea

"SEARCH PROBLEM"
IS ON IN EARNEST
AFTER THE OVERDUE NAVY
TUG NINA.
Vessels from Many Points Pushing
Into Stormy Sea.
Washington, Feb. 12. Somewhere
off the Atlantic coast between Norfolk
and Boston, the little naval tug Nina
with thirty-two men on board, is
wallowing in great billows with
broken machinery, awaiting the ar
rival of one of eight government ves
sels now speeding to her supposed
location.
As bad as it is the prospect that the
vessels will reach her is the best hope
of officials at the navy department
tonight. The alternative is that the
Nina is at the bottom of the sea with
a better chance that the crew has
been rescued.
Last Sunday the Nina steamed out
of Hampton Roads for Boston. Be
fore the day was far advanced stiff
northwest winds sprang up, making
what the sailors call a "nasty sea."
Under ordinary conditions the tug
should have reached Boston on Tues
day, but it was only yesterday that
the naval officials here began to feel
serious apprehension for her safety.
As no word of arrival reached the
department today, an immediate
search was ordered.
From Norfolk went the swift stout
cruiser Salem and the battleship
Louisiana. These vessels were in
structed to cruise as far as Cape
May along the coast.
From New York the navy yard col
lier Culgoa started on a cruise. It
will be followed soon by the tugs
Apache and Pontiac. The gunboat
Castine and the collier Caesar left
the Boston navy yard to join in the
search. Then the revenue cutter ser
vice went to the assistance of the
navy and orders were flashed to the
cutters Acushnet and Grecian at
Boston and New London to take part.
The problem is similar to what is
known as the "search problem" in
naval strategy. The ocean is divided
into squares, one number being given
to each ship. Naval officers believe
that the Nina broke a shaft or dropped
a propeller or was blown off shore
by the northwest gale.

Four splendid aviation events, a
splendid ten-mile auto race and a five-
mile motorcycle race comprised the
amusement program of yesterday at
the fair grounds. These were enliv
ened by the largest crowd of the three
days, put in the best of nature by the
fine events of the preceding days, and
the pleasure of the afternoon was less
marred by the minor accidents that
always have to be taken into account.
There was but one yesterday. It oc
curred before the program began, was
quite interesting in itself, and the
damage was quickly repaired. The
flying events consisted of a flight by
Hamilton, a five-mile race between
Hamilton and an auto, a cross-country
by Willard, and a big double event
by Hamilton and Willard in which the
former reached the highest altitude he
has negotiated here and dropped to
the ground with as long and perfect a
glide as one could imagine possible
under any conditions. And the best
announcement of the day was that
there will be more of the big show
this afternoon.
A feature of the day that pleased
the visitors and that also worked to
the advantage of the aviators, was
that the latter elected to alight in ev
ery instance on the race track, refus
ing longer to utilize the infield for
terminal purposes. Three stops were
made on the finishing stretch of the
race track and the final glide by Ham
ilton brought him down on the back
stretch beyond the fences. Hitherto
the landings have been made in the
infield to escape the possibility of run
ning into fences and the uneven sur
face of the ground below the grass,
due to irrigation ditches, has tipped
the planes, caught the connecting
rods, and in one way or another caus
ed most of the minor injuries to the
aircraft. The aviators have learned
that the Arizona air is well disciplined
and they no longer fear, as they did
at first, the interference of little
cross currents in landing that might
throw them into the fence, except in
the event of shutting off their engines
for a glide, in which case they are
compelled to drift more or less with
the air. They have learned that on
an ordinary day, if they can get
straight with the track they can land
safely upon it, especially while the en
gines are going, and with much less
danger to their machines. And that
plan also pleases the audience for the
start and the finish are as interesting
as the flight itself and the people like
to see it near by.

THE ACCIDENT.
The accident was a mere whim of
the big 8-cylinder machine, and was
interesting as emphasizing the fact
that there is always something pos-
sible to happen to an aeroplane in the
present stage of its development, and
when least expected, and it will gen
erally do the last thing one would
think probable. In this instance it
occurred right in front of the grand
stand, where Mr. Hamilton had the
machine while trying out the engine
previous to the first event of the af
ternoon. The propellers were whirling
around so fast that one could scarcely
see them while a dozen men were
holding the big device from moving
up the track like an automobile. Sud
denly something popped like a burst
ing tire and one end of the machine
settled three or four inches toward
the ground. The engine was stopped
in a moment, when it was seen that
one of the propeller blades had been
splintered and a strip two or three feet
long and an inch thick or more at one

CIRCLING THE FAIR GROUNDS
and sharpened like a toothpick at the
other, had broken off and shot through
the tire of one of the rear wheels,
sticking there but letting the air out
of the tube. It was the one chance
in a thousand that the splinter did
not hit some one of a dozen men
standing around the machine, in which
case it would surely have gone clear
through him.
The work of substituting a new pro
peller and a new wheel only required
a few minutes and the engine being
in good condition, the flying began at
once. In line with the observation
made above, Mr. Willard said last ev
ening that the aeroplanes are a con
stant surprise in that respect. One
never knows what will happen. He
says he has had propellers break,
wings give way, wire braces snap, and
all manner of similar things happen
while he was in the air. It is the
constant dread of the flyer that some
thing like that will occur. Such things
give the flyer a great deal more un
easiness than anything else, for under
ordinary conditions if everything
works well there is little danger of his
ability to control the machine and
there is a pretty complete knowledge
of what it can do and what can be
done with it. Theoretically every
thing is nicely provided for but the
machine has to be constructed so del
icately, one never knows what mo
ment some part of it will refuse to
stand the strain with such a powerful
engine pumping in such an unstable
construction.
The First Flight.
Wheeling his machine to the upper
track in a very few minutes Mr. Ham
ilton was in the air for a cross-country
run of four minutes and ten sec
onds. He took the usual course south
east across the field to the fence,
thence east, north and west back to
the grounds, which he circled the sec
ond time and then settled down sub
limely on the race track in front of
the cheering people. It was only a
try-out preliminary to the big con
tract with the Studebaker buzz wagon.
But first it was decided to warm
up the latter in its ten-mile contest
with the Buick for a cup, $1000 and a
lot of glory.
THE AUTOMOBILE DUEL.
The Studebaker E. M. F. had al
ready tried the track with Bruce
Burch behind the goggles. The Buick
under the coaching of Smith, Mel
Johnson's chauffeur, circled the oval
and all was in readiness. At the
crack of the gun the Studebaker
made the best get-away and was
yards ahead before the White Streak
got well started. The lead was in
creased a little on the first lap, which
ended with less than three seconds
between them. In the next lap a part
of a second was gained by the Stud
ebaker, making the difference even
three seconds. A part of a second
was lost in the third, two-fifths of a
second gained in the fourth and an
other fifth in the next, and in the
sixth the white machine gained four
fifths of a second on the black one.
In the next, four the Buick lost slow
ly and finally lost the race by 13 4/5
seconds. Following is the time, by
laps, singly and accumulated:
