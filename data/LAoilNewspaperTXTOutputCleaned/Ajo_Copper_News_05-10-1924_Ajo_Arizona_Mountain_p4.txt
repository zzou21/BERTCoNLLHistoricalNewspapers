SENATOR CAMERON WANTS
TWO CADETS FOR
WEST POINT ACADEMY
April 23rd, 1924.
Editor Copper News,
Ajo, Ariz.
MY DEAR SIR:—I have at my
disposal the appointment of two
cadets to the U. S. Military Academy
at West Point. To insure an equal
opportunity to every Arizona boy to
secure one of these appointments
I am holding a competitive examina-
tion through the Civil Service Com-
mission on Saturday, May 31st, 1924.
The two boys receiving the highest
marks in this examination will re-
ceive official appointment to the
Military Academy, provided they are
equipped to furnish an educational
certificate from an accredited high
school, or its equivalent. The four
boys receiving the next highest
marks will be named as alternates
and will be considered for appoint-
ments according to their ratings,
in the event the principals fail to
meet the entrance requirements. I
am making these appointments ab-
solutely nonpartisan and care noth-
ing for the political affiliations of
the applicants, as I believe that
merit should govern such important
appointments.
I will appreciate it very much if
you will give the widest publicity
to this examination through the
columns of your paper, thus co—

others in the precious health-element.

LOS ANGELES CHAMBER
THINKS WELL OF AHUMADA
The following report on the
Ahumada and Erupcion mining prop-
erties, shares of which are owned
locally, is from the official Monthly
Magazine, Chamber of Mines and
Oil, Los Angeles.
Steady advances recently recorded
in lead quotations are most en-
couraging factors to two lead pro-
ducers in Mexico, the Ahumada and
Erupcion Mining companies, operat-

GROWTH OF LOS ANGELES
SHOWN BY SCHOOL
ATTENDANCE FOUR YEARS
Los Angeles will have to build a
16-room school building every week
in the year if the present rate of
enrollment increase continues, ac-
cording to an article appearing in
Southern California Business. The
average daily attendance in the Los
Angeles schools has increased from
75,531 in 1920 to a shade less than
200,000 in 1924.
COMING NEXT WEEK
Dr. Schell, the well-known opto-
metrist and optician of Tucson, will
be at the Cornelia Hotel on his reg-
ular visit on Wednesday of next
week (14th) and will remain the
one day only. If you need glasses,
call on him for expert service.

hua. These companies, it is stated,
have successfully developed two of the
largest deposits of lead-silver bear-
ing ore so far opened up in that
country.
These mines are on adjoining
properties, and are under joint
ownership and management. They
are located about eighty-five miles
southeast of El Paso, where the pro-
duct of the mines is treated by a
local smelter. The two companies
own and operate a railroad line
from Lamentos to Lucero, on the
Mexican Central Railroad. At pres-
ent the Erupcion is shipping 6000
tons monthly to the smelter while
the Ahumada is shipping about half
that quantity.
Important Discoveries Made

Quite recently, it is said, several
important discoveries have been made
in both the Erupcion and the
Ahumada mines, their workings dis-
closing a cave of more than 1000
feet in length, containing large
bodies of profitable ore that can be
easily worked. The ore occurs in
veins of blanket formation having
a dip of about fifteen degrees.
Both mines have been well equip-
ped for economical operation, an
electrically operated hoisting plant
being a recent installation; while
the companies have expended ap-
proximately $100,000 in the build-
ing of a modern town at the base
of the mountain just below the portal
of the main working tunnel.

Tunnel Serves Both Mines
This tunnel is about a mile in
length, with its entrance in Erupcion
ground. It cuts through that com-
pany’s holdings into Ahumada ter-
ritory and serves both organizations
for general mining purposes.
It is estimated that the Erupcion
mine has a ten-year ore supply in
sight at its present rate of produc-
tion, and that the Ahumada has de-
veloped ore bodies sufficient to main-
tain present output for twenty or
thirty years.
Much general interest is taken
in the successful operations of these
two companies, which have made
surprisingly good records during the
past few years. The stockholders
are particularly pleased with the
extensive bodies of ore developed,
and its excellent grade. Other
important factors in the success of
the management and the ability
and care exercised in mine develop-
ment and in the selection of equip-
ment.
Dividend Disbursements

The Ahumada Lead Company paid
its initial dividend of 7% cents a
share on January 2, and an extra
dividend of 2% cents a share,
amounting to $118,701.80.
Erupcion Mining Company paid its
regular quarterly dividend of 12%
cents a share on the same date,
amounting to $156,250.00. With this
dividend the company has disbursed
$625,000 to its stockholders to
date, covering net proceeds from ship-
ments made in 1923. Its first
dividend was paid on April 2, 1923.
Dr. L. D. Rickets and Gen. John
C. Greenway, officials of the Calumet
& Arizona Mining Company, War-
ren, Arizona, are respectively presi-
dent and vice-president and general
manager, of the Ahumada and
Erupcion companies.

POEMS THAT LIVE

MY CREED
I hold that Christian grace abound,
Where charity is seen; that whey
We climb to heaven ’tis on the
rounds
Of love to men.
I hold all else named piety
A selfish scheme, a vain pretense:
Where center is not—can there be
Circumference?
This I moreover hold, and dare
Affirm where’er my rhyme may go
Whatever things be sweet or fair,
Love makes them so.
Whether it be the lullabies
That charm to rest the nursling
bird,
Or the sweet confidence of sighs
And blushes made without a word.
Whether the dazzling and the flush
Of softly sumptuous garden bowers
Or by some cabin door a bush
Of ragged flowers.
'Tis not the wide phylactery.
Nor stubborn fast, nor stated
prayers.
That makes us saints; we judge
the tree
By what it bears.
And when a man can live apart
From works, on theologic trust.
I know the blood about his heart
Is dry as dust.

AHUMADA LEAD CO. ACTIVE—

H. C. Dudley, vice president of
Ahumada Lead company, has re-
cently paid a visit to the properties
of the company which are located in
Mexico, taking chances on the
bandits that were reported to in-
fest the Sierra de Los Lamentos dis-
trict of Chihuahua. When it was
recently announced and reported
that Hippolito Villa and his gang had
started north on a rampage, leaving
the ranch of his late brother, de-
fense Sociales 1,500 strong left
Cusihuiriachi to meet them, having
grown very tired of banditry.
Among the men were many ranchers,
miners, cowboys and business men
who had formed an organization
much like the old Vigilantes. Mem-
bers of this home guard were pa-
trolling the mountain trails about
the mining district in which the
Ahumada and Erupcion mines are
located, and no trouble was looked
for from the Villa band.
The new cave at Ahumada lies
between Nos. 4 and 5 raises, forty
feet above the ore body first en-
countered in these raises, and con-
siderable to the west of them. The
new cave is 380 feet long, very
wide and filled with high-grade ore.
The lateral extension of the latter
is not yet known. The amounts of
ore developed by the comparative-
ly small degree of development
work due to striking these large
caves and irregular extensions of
ore bodies makes it look as if the
chances for finding ore in this area
is very similar to other lime stone
camps in Mexico which have
produced for a long time and none
of them yet dug out. This
sort of history is true of the Pima
copper deposits. They never
have had many years’ ore tonnage
in sight at any one time but a rea-
sonable amount of development al-
ways brings in a lot more.
Ahumada has fully recovered from
its small fire and is now produc-
ing at a heavier rate than ever in
history. Considerable development
work is under way in the shape of
drifts and raises to get the new ore-
bodies discovered last fall, in con-
dition to mine quickly.
It was Mr. Dudley who brought
these properties together and who
deserves credit for making this fine
success possible.
