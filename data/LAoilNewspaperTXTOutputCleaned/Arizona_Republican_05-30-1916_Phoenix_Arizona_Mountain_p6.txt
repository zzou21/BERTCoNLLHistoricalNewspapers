years in the state prison at Florence.

yesterday morning and at the same
time gave Jose Orduno, a forger,

GANDY BACK After a six days’
camping trip, County Attorney Clyde
W. Gandy is back at his desk. Im-
mediately after his arrival in the
city the county attorney plunged into
work, for there is an enormous
amount to be transacted during the
month of June. It is understood that
a week will be given over to criminal
cases in Judge Stanford’s court the
latter part of the month, although
the dates have not been set. Among
these will be the Reddington-Stevens
case. It has been a strenuous year
for the county attorney’s office and
Mr. Gandy has profited by his brief
vacation. Mrs. Gandy and their chil-
dren accompanied him on the trip and
thoroughly enjoyed the camp life.
They pitched their tent at the north
end of Roosevelt Lake, where good
fishing was one of the pleasures.
