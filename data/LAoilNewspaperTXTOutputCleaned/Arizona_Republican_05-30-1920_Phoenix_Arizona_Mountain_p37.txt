increase of motor cars was
blamed for a heavy drain in
the sale of horseshoes.

The growing problem of railroad
transportation is bringing the import-
ance of the modern truck trailer to the
fore as never in the history of the
country," declared Winfield Hart-
rank, distributor of Utility Trailers,
“and the thousands of truck owners
who have used trailers have found their
territories from northwestern Canada to
Lower California, and from the coast
as far east as Denver. Owing to the
assistance trailers render in solving the
transportation problems, and cutting
down expense of deliveries, the United
States government is encouraging their
manufacture, and we are able to se-
cure an adequate supply of materials to
keep the factory at the peak of pro-
duction.”
A LIMITED NUMBER OF
transportation costs can be cut about
one-half.
“The trailer is solving the hauling
problem in all parts of the country, and
this is particularly so in the West.
The demand for trailers today calls for
a type of construction equally as sturdy
as the truck itself, owing to the wide

The Car of Excess Value

THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 30, 1920

(A cartoon appears here)

A REMARKABLE patented feature, not found
on any other motor truck on the market, gives
“The Nation’s Freight Car” a quality of shock
absorption and smoother travel that not only saves
the load from the road, but thoroughly protects
the mechanism from vibration. It is the Diamond
T Perfected-Hotchkiss principle of “drive,” at the
rear through the springs only. This means a
simpler assembly and fewer parts, and is made
absolutely practical through the use of the Diamond
T method of Spring Anchorage. One big user of
all kinds of trucks says he gets “15 more mileage
per gallon of gasoline and oil and 100 more tire
mileage” from this no-radius-rod construction.
Why not let us show you this exclusive
economy feature without any obligation?

FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY

COMMONWEALTH

TO BE HERE
SHORTLY

The George H. Reuben Auto com-
pany, at 327 North Central avenue,
has just received word from the Com-
monwealth Motor Company of Chicago
that a carload of the Commonwealth
4-40s are now en route for their Phoe-
nix agency. These cars are expected
to arrive within the next few days and
will be displayed and demonstrated at
the salesrooms of the George H. Reu-
ben Auto Company as soon as they
arrive.
The Commonwealth 4-40 took sec-
ond place in the Yosemite Valley econ-
omy run officially sanctioned by the
A. A. A. The object was to make the
run with the least gasoline, oil and
water consumption. The course was
from Los Angeles to Camp Curry in
the Yosemite Valley, a distance of 366
miles, crossing two mountain ranges,
attaining altitudes of 5,000 feet and
6,227 feet above sea level.
The cars were to be all stock equip-
ment and the general plan followed
was “ride and coast.” The other cars
had special needle valves in their car-
buretors, making a very lean mixture,
but the Commonwealth had only the
stock needle.
The gasoline mileage on the first
day’s run averaged 32 miles per gal-
lon, with the oil consumption so small
that it did not show on the gauge at
all. The average mileage for the whole
run was 29.5 miles per gallon of gaso-
line and over 1,500 miles to the gallon
of oil.
If this had been a reliability run, the
Commonwealth would have had high
place. In this contest the mechanic
could not find anything to do; no bolts
to tighten and nothing to fix. The car
ran so smoothly that it reached its
destination two hours ahead of time.
The Commonwealth 4-40 is a car of
unusual beauty and efficiency for its
low price, and its introduction here
will soon make for it the same en-
thusiasm and approval that it has met
with in every other state that has suc-
ceeded in getting a delivery of them.
For the protection of members many
automobile clubs in the United States
are establishing legal departments.
Columbia University twenty years
ago established a department of motor
vehicle construction in the School of
Mines.

Security, Service and Good Looks
These are the things the discriminating automobile buyer looks for in
a car.
Compare the specifications of the ELCAR with that of any car selling
up to three or four hundred dollars more. Then inspect the ELCAR in de-
tail. Note the extra strong, beautifully balanced chassis construction.
Note the size, beauty and finish of the car. Test the luxurious cushions.
Note the completeness and quality of all items of equipment.
Test the car. Note the lithe, eager way it responds to the slightest ad-
vance of the throttle. Observe how silently and smoothly it runs at all
speeds from two to sixty miles an hour. Try it on hills, or in the deep sand
of the desert, and see how wonderfully and quietly it pulls—then you will
realize why the ELCAR deserves the title of “The Car of Excess Value.”
In what price car would you expect to find the following specifica-
tions? Red Seal Continental motors in the sixes; Lycoming motors in the
fours; Delco Starting, Lighting and Ignition. Salisbury Pressed Steel
Axles, Borg and Beck Clutch, Stromberg Carburetor. You have them all
in the ELCAR.
