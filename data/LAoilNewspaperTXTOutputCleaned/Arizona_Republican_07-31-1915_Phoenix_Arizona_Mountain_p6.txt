AN OLD OFFENDER Hazel Mc
Daniel, an old offender, was before
the police court yesterday charged
with drunkenness. Her case was
set for this morning and she was
released on bail in the sum of $25.
She threatened to leave town rather
than to endure the continued perse
cution to which she was being sub
jected. She is thinking of returning
to New York and re-entering society.
Her case was in some respects a
rather refreshing one, a break in the
monotony. She had got drunk on
whisky instead of denatured alcohol,
the cause of most of the slips from
sobriety that have been brought to
the attention of the police.

AMICABLY ADJUSTED Judge
McBride succeeded yesterday, after
he had slept over it, in rendering a
judgment in the case of the Greek
proprietor of two pool rooms in the
vicinity of Third and Washington
streets, that was satisfactory to all
parties concerned. It was shown
that the grievance of the complaining
neighbors was cumulative and that
most of the causes for complaint
had occurred before the administra
tion of the defendants whose owner
ship is recent. They promised that
henceforth the pool rooms should be
made to resemble an orderly grave
yard for quietness and the complain
ants said such pool rooms would
meet all specifications.

ROTARY IS GOOD MUSIC

Yesterday’s Program Ran
to Phonographs and
Pianos, When It Wasn’t
Brains” With San Fran
cisco Convention

Yesterday was musical day at the
Rotary luncheon. There was music
and chin-music.
In the intervals of Charles H. Chris
ty’s presiding, Wallace Hutton did a
talk via Edison phonograph. Hutton
made the talk and so did the machine.
He made that phonograph appear to
hate itself, saying things about its clear
tone and indestructible records.
H. B. Marvin described the construc
tion of pianos. He showed the parts of
a player piano and told how they
worked.
Captain Taylor gave a report on the
San Francisco meeting of the Rotarians
of all the world. He showed a trunk
load of souvenirs, fans, pencils and of
fice paraphernalia given to the dele
gates. He asserted that the entertain
ment provided for the Rotary people
was wonderful in the extreme. He
gave interesting details of each day’s
work at the Convention and told of the
notable members of the order whom he
met at banquets, dances and other do
ings spread over six days and five
nights, making eleven red-star occas
ions in all.
The 1916 convention will be held in
Cincinnati.

EXTRA SLEEPER—An additional
Pullman will be attached to the Phoe

limit on the tickets is October 31.

REPAIR DEPARTMENT—Attention
is again called to the new advertising
department which will be introduced
into The Republican in which will ap
pear the advertisements of all kinds of
repair men. People will no longer have
to guess where they will have to go to
get things fixed.

BACK AGAIN—A. E. Schmitz, trav
eling representative of the El Paso Pla
ting Company, was in the city yesterday
bound for the Pass city, after having
taken in the fairs on the coast. He will
take a slant at a number of Wurlitzer
auto pianos that his people
have placed in various theaters here
abouts.

WALLACE-LYBROOK—Word was
received in Phoenix yesterday of the
recent marriage at San Francisco of
William Wallace to Mrs. Annie Ly

ARIZONA MAY SEND
SPECIAL TRAIN TO
’FRISCO EXPOSITION

Postponement of Arizona Day Until
Late August May Result in a Large
Attendance From This State.
Big Celebration is Planned

Announcement that Arizona Day,
which was to have been celebrated yes
terday at the Panama-Pacific exposi
tion, has been postponed until August
28 was made yesterday by the expo
sition authorities, and plans are already
under way for its celebration on that
date. Appropriate ceremonies and a
program of special interest to the resi
dents of this state will be a feature of
the day.
With the postponement of the cele
bration, there will be consolidated Ari
zona day and governor’s day, and all
the other days or occasions peculiar to
the newest state. On account of the
probable large attendance of Arizon
ians at the celebration, it has been pro
posed that a special train be run from
this state, with delegations from all the
important points. Such a train, bring
ing a huge Arizona delegation and
headed by the First Regiment band, it
is pointed out, would be one of the best
advertisements of the state ever pulled
off.
“The last week in August or the
first part of September is the very best
time of the year to visit San Francis
co,” said Adjutant General Harris yes
terday, who is working for the special
train. “There are no fogs at that time
of the year, and the weather is most
delightful. A delegation such as San
Francisco sent to Arizona several years
ago would be a big advertisement for
this state at the exposition.”
Gov. Hunt, who sent word that it
would be impossible for him to attend
Arizona day on July 30, has not yet an
nounced whether he will attend the
celebration next month, but it is
thought likely that he will be able to
attend at that time.

WINS PRIZE
Firm Honored Among Leaders
In Great National Contest

One of the leaders in the great
national contest of Hoosier Kitchen
Cabinet agents this year is Dorris-
Heyman Furniture Company.
The contest was the greatest in the
history of the Hoosier Company.
Forty-five hundred dealers took part
in towns of every size and condition,
more than a million dollars’ worth of
the famous Hoosier step-savers were
sold.

Writing Dorris-Heyman Furni
ture Company, the Hoosier Company
said:
“It is a great pleasure indeed to
send you this check which you won
in the Hoosier prize contest during
the spring. The money represented
in this check is only a portion of
the real advantage we feel that the
prize contest has won for you. It
is no small thing to stand among the
winners of one of the hardest fought
prize contests ever held in this coun
try.”
o
SUNDAY AND THE FAIR
Proposal of Big Revival During Great
Exposition, Opposed

Howard A. Hanks is the private sec
retary of Josephus Daniels, secretary
of the navy. Howard Hanks has writ
ten an article for the Sunday-School
Times, entitled “The Challenge of the
Proud and Reckless ’Frisco.” Presum
ably it was the editor who offended the
city of Saint Francis by the oft-repu
diated abbreviation of its name. Mr.
Hanks, after drawing an alluring pic
ture of “beautiful and brilliant, care
free and dare-devil, all but pagan” San
Francisco, reminds the world that of
the city’s population of half a million
only 30 per cent can be claimed as
Christians, the remaining 70 per cent
having no church connection whatever.
He also sets forth that only 4 per cent
of the population, eighteen thousand
out of half a million souls, is affiliated
with Protestant churches, and that no
other large city in all Christendom has
so large a proportion of religious mav
ericks as the child of the Argonauts.
To remedy this condition, Mr. Hanks
echoes the demand of Dr. H. H. Bell,
in charge of the religious work for the
Panama-Pacific exposition, and of
Bishop Hughes that the religious revi
val planned for San Francisco under
the leadership of Gypsy Smith and J.
Wilbur Chapman be supplemented by
a three months’ campaign conducted by
Billy Sunday and his organization.
Billy Sunday would undoubtedly be a
tremendous drawing card, especially if
his meetings could be conducted within
the exposition grounds, but it is ex
tremely doubtful whether his peculiar
methods could permanently lift the
consciousness of San Francisco onto a
higher spiritual plane.
Nor will Billy Sunday be able to
make a permanent impression upon
San Francisco’s thought. San Francis
co has too much vaudeville, too much
of the circus atmosphere in its every
day life, to crave more of the same
thing in the hours of its spiritual ablu
tions. To speak very plainly, San
Francisco is not afraid of the old-fashioned
sulphurous hell preached by Billy
Sunday; a sermon based upon the
earthquake as a warning, upon brim
stone and boiling pitch as impending
punishment, will not be effective.
To arouse San Francisco’s almost
dormant spiritual nature, another vau
deville show will not do. A preacher
and a prophet of Paul’s dignity, of
John’s love and Luther’s strength is
needed for the task. —June Sunset.
