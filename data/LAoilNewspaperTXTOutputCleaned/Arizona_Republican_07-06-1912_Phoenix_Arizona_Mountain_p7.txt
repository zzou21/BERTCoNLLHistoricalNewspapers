AMUSEMENTS

AT THE WIGWAM
"The Counsel for the Defense," a
Vitagraph, is the feature film of the
new program opening at the Wigwam
tonight for two nights only. Lynn
Charter and Laura Gray are very
much in love with each other. Lynn
goes to New York to engage in busi
ness. During his absence Laura
meets Hammond Cowan, a wealthy
man and marries him for his money.
Trouble follows, Cowan killing one of
his workmen. The crime is blamed
on Laura and she is hailed into court.
She is acquitted and later she and
Lynn acknowledge their love for each
other and marry.
Following this excellent picture
comes "The Old Actor," a Biograph,
presenting the well-known favorite
actors. Then follows "A Son's De
votion," showing a young man's de
votion to his aged father.
The fourth film is "A La Fran
çaise," an English and French love
scene. This picture is acted in Eng
land and France and many elaborate
gowns are shown.
Last night's performance at the
Wigwam was well attended. Don't
forget the entire change of program
tonight.

picture house but special efforts will
be made to produce the best line of
pictures ever seen in this city. The
big number will be The Lost Teleg
rapher, a drama of frontier days
wherein a plainsman who knows the
dots and dashes is able to prevent
an Indian massacre. There will be
other pictures to fill out a good pro
gram and Emil Spatz who has made
such a hit with his singing of illus
trated songs, will be numbered after
this week with the Empress entertainers.

THE COLISEUM.
The Coliseum will present an en
tirely new program tonight from

beginning to end. The same teams
will appear in the vaudeville numbers
but they will have new stunts. Watts
and Lucas the acrobatic dancers who
have been doing the scarecrow act
so successfully will have another
novelty and Manchester and Wensley
will have new songs, new dances and
new jokelets. The photoplays will be
entirely new as well as the news

slides showing the latest events that
have been transferred to the camera,
and Emil Spatz will also be on hand

with his pleasing voice in illustrated
songs.

THE EMPRESS.
Only a fair sized audience greeted

"The Rounders" at the Empress last
night but a big crowd is expected
tonight for Saturday night is one of
the big nights of the week usually,
and the engagement of this popular
company is drawing rapidly to a
close. The Aviators is a good lively
comedy bill all the way through with
Spaulding and Burton at their best
and a full cast helping them out.

The chorus girls do their part and

are as fetching as ever. The solo
work of Miss Davis is good and it is
worth the price to see Heinie pose
as a statue 200 years old.
Monday night the Empress will for
the time being resolve itself into a

MATERIA MEDICA AND ANATOMY.

The last time Urey Woodson was in
Atlanta, Georgia, he went through a
factory and got so much oil and grease
on his trousers that he had to send
them to an old colored man to be clean
ed. The following morning the negro
appeared before Woodson with this la
ment: "Deed, Mr. Woodson, I don't think
I gwine be able to clean dese here
pants. I done tried gasoline and pear
line and naphtha, and don't any of
them seem to do no good."
"Have you tried ammonia?" asked
Woodson.
"No, sah," said the old darky. "I ain't
tried 'em on me yet, but I reckon they'd
fit me all right." The Popular Magazine.

Hire a little salesman at The Re
publican office. A "Want Ad" will see
more customers than you can.

The picnic held at the Teel home on
Central avenue was the largest and
best Fourth of July celebration ever
held in this district. The program was
very interesting and well rendered. C.
B. Wood delivered a patriotic address
and Prof. Jantzen also gave a short
talk. National songs were sung and
several readings were delivered. The
lunch, the grandest and best ever, was
served on the shady lawn. There were
about three hundred persons present.
All report this the most successful of
Independence Day jollifications.
Mrs. S. K. Philips has returned from
a trip through the northern part of the
state and says the climate is cool with
much rain. Mr. Philips who accom
panied her will stay at Prescott till
business matters are settled. He is ex
pected to return in about a week.

At a meeting of the board of trustees
of Osborn district many changes were

made in the arrangements of the class
es and school house. They also decided
to employ Miss Xaoma Griffin of
Phoenix as a teacher of the third grade.

A manual training teacher had pre
viously been selected. There will be nine
teachers employed during the coming
term.

Miss Clara Wright gave a delightful
farewell party in honor of Miss Aura
Colvin last Wednesday evening. Miss
Colvin after having spent the winter in
the valley will leave for the east in a
few days.
One of the most important events of
recent date is the organization of the
"Black Canyon Indian Club" which has
enrolled a large number of members
from all parts of the valley. The presi
dent is George Peterson who will serve
for six months. The purpose of the
club is to promote and elevate social
conditions of the neighborhood. Many
purchases have been made to furnish
the rooms already rented. No definite
date has been set for the next meeting
but it will be held in a few days.
The Indian School closed one of the
brightest and most successful terms in
the history of the school last Wednes
day. Most of the pupils will return to
their homes on the reservation while
some will spend their vacation in the
cooler climes. A few have been em
ployed to take care of the grounds and
dairy. The sanitorium will be kept
open all summer.
The Young Peoples Missionary soci
ety held its regular session at the beau
tiful country home of Mr. and Mrs. L.
B. Morell last Tuesday night. Many im
portant business matters were brought
up and settled. The meeting was well
attended and a decision was made to
hold regular meetings during the sum
mer.

J. T. Perry and Del Nofziger think
they have the record for baling hay
with a horse power press. The baler
was started at about six in the morn
ing and worked till about 5 o’clock P.
M. baling a little over thirty-five tons.
The crew consisted of the oldest and
best hay men in the valley.
While Richard Bishop passed a few
days on his cattle range in the hills,
he was thrown from a horse, badly
bruising his face and breaking his
collar bone. Bishop was immediately
brought home and is now doing very
well, although it will be several months
before he will be out again.

Mrs. Patterson, living on the Black
Canyon road left for a three months’
stay with relatives and friends in San
Francisco, her former home. Mrs.
Patterson was accompanied by her
daughter Alamada.

Charles Acker was seriously bruised
and cut up by a fractious horse, is able
to be up and around again. Dr. F.
Redewill after having performed the
operation of trephining removing sev
eral small pieces of bone, said the only
thing to prevent his early recovery of
health is the danger of infection.
Misses Ruth McComas, Lois Mullen
and Cecil Mullen are passing the week
end at the Felch home on the new
Black Canyon road.
Mr. Gene Woolf part owner of the
hay baler which burnt last week while
baling on the Egly ranch in Creighton
says he will have the new one at work
in a few days.

O. A. Speakman was called to his for
mer home in Pittsburg, Penn., to settle
several important business matters
which have been causing much anxiety.
Mr. Speakman will return in the early
fall.

J. V. Dorris just recently purchased
a new hay baler which
has been set up and is now running in
full blast. Some trouble was had with
it at its first trials but since the ex
perienced mechanic has been employed
the baler does well, making smooth
bales and requiring less men than on
most presses now working in the val
ley.
The services held at the Bethel
church were well attended. The regular
pastor Rev. J. C. Williams conducted
both services. Next Sunday’s sermons
will be of great interest and a large
crowd is expected. The morning service
will commence at 10:45 and the even
ing sermon will be preached at 8 o’clock.
Everybody is extended a cordial invita
tion to attend.

Dr. Taylor of the San Carlos Indian
reservation is spending a few days at
the Indian school and reports every
thing in fine condition there.

BABY STATE

White Clad Team Will Challenge Any
Old Team. Other Town News.

The Chandler baseball team has
ordered white suits with black trim
mings, and within two weeks, hand
somely garbed, will be ready for chal
lenges from any of the valley teams.
The boys practice two hours every
evening on the grounds east of the
railroad tracks.
The team seems to be strong in
pitching material. Cashman was
formerly a star twirler of the Mis
souri State league, pitching for Se
dalia. Jaycox is a college man from
Chicago whose work was good enough
to attract the attention of big league
scouts, but he was injured while
playing football, thus ending his base
ball career. Jaycox, however, is
throwing fine in practice and hopes
his wrecked shoulder will come
around all right. Both he and Cash
man have a lot of curves and speed.
In a practice game last Sunday, Jay
cox fanned eleven men in four innings.

ACTIVITY IN LAND SELLING

Despite the fact it is the middle of
summer, land activity continues in
the Chandler section. During the
past week four plots of forty acres
each were sold, three to southern
California parties and one to an east
erner. At least forty families, who
purchased Chandler lands during the
past six months, but who have not
yet moved thereon, are preparing to
move to Chandler when the present
hot season ends. Building is going
on in every direction.

PURCHASES HOLSTEIN HERD
Henry D. Peterson, who farms 320
acres east of Chandler, has purchased
from the Reynaud stock farm, near
Alhambra, twenty-six head of regis
tered Holstein cattle, eighteen cows,
seven heifer calves and the blue rib
bon bull Roderick Lincoln, twin to
Roberts Dad, and one of the finest
individuals in the famous Reynaud
herd. Peterson will go into the
blooded stock business on an exten
sive scale. The consignment reached
Chandler Tuesday by rail.

JEFF DUNCAN RETURNS
After a month spent in Chicago,
his old home at Attica, Indiana, and
visiting a famous nerve specialist in
Kansas, School Trustee Thomas Jef
ferson Duncan returned to Chandler
Monday. He reports a wide spread
interest in Arizona lands, due largely
to the extensive advertising campaign
carried on by the Chandler ranch.
He attended four sessions of the
Chicago convention, thanks to Ralph
Cameron who was present doing
herculean work for the president's
renomination.

SCHOOL ELECTION
August 1 has been set as the time
for the election of the teachers in
the Chandler grammar school, which
will open the latter part of Septem
ber. It is probable the salaries will
be fixed at $85 for the opening ses
sion.

Three teachers, and possibly five
will be chosen. The first of the three
buildings is completed, and work will
begin very soon on the second, for
which $8,000 bonds have been voted.
Less than a year ago the census of
Chandler showed only eight children.
Now there are in the neighborhood
of 150 and more coming every week.

BALTIMORE, July 4. William Jennings Bryan had some able men associated with him on the committee on
resolutions during the democratic national convention. Senator O'Gorman of New York was one of them. Though
not in the senate long, he has taken a leading place there, and he was considered as a possible presiding officer for
the big meeting. Senator Atlee Pomerene of Ohio is also prominent nationally, and Secretary Walsh has had much
political experience.

DOING RUSHING BUSINESS
Manager Halsted, of the Chandler
Lumber company, is very busy these
days filling orders for the lumber
needed in the building boom in pro
gress all over the Chandler ranch
section. President George C. Smith
of the Chamber of Commerce, has
just completed a bungalow home on
Arizona avenue, costing over three
thousand dollars. A mile north of
the Smith home, Dr. A. Fellowes of
Ontario, Cal., is building an eleven
room bungalow to cost in the neigh
borhood of $10,000. The two homes
are typical of the homes which will
go up during the remaining months
of 1912 on the restricted parts of
Chandler ranch. Many large hay
barns are also being built, the farm
ers preferring to build and store
rather than take the summer prices
for alfalfa being offered by the deal
ers. Thousands of tons are already
safely housed, in anticipation of the
much higher fall and winter prices.

GOMES HIGH

It Will Cost $700,000 More
to Run It Than the Ex
penses Were Under the
Territorial Form of Government

It is becoming evident that statehood
at all events statehood in its infancy,
is a rather expensive proposition.
"You wait until the extent of the
appropriations made by this legislature
are footed up and you will be sur
prised," Senator Sims, of Cochise coun
ty, said to The Republican just after
the adjournment of the special session.
It was on this ground that Sims justi
fied his opposition to some of the ap
propriation bills.
And, to tell the truth, there is some
element of surprise in the present fi
nancial situation. For it will cost
Arizona half a million dollars more to
run its government this year than it
did last year. In other words, it cost
about $700,000 last year; and this year
it will cost $1,200,000.
In fact, it will cost more than that.
That sum represents the known ap
propriations. But it will be recalled
some bills were passed that, while
providing for appropriations, did not
mention specific sums. Just how much
these bills carry cannot be told at this
time.
But this is known—the expenses
have jumped from $700,000 to $1,200,000,
which is an increase of more than 71
per cent.
But after all there is some balm in
Gilead. It will not be nearly so bad as
it looks, the officials say. The expense
to the average citizen will be kept
down because the assessments on rail
road and mining property have been
raised. It is believed that the tax rate
will be very little higher than last year.
It is now found that the estimated
valuation on all property in the state
was placed too low. It was believed a
few days ago that it would reach $160,
000,000. The truth is it will come near
er $180,000,000.
Suppose it is $175,000,000, that would
make a rate approximately 70 cents on
the hundred dollars. It was 65 cents
last year.
The amount to be expended on roads
this year is $250,000. The road rate
will be about 15 cents on each $100.

THE SUBURBS OF THE WEST.

The East Has Been an Experimental
Station for the Coast Cities.

The east has been an experimental
station for the west in the matter of
suburb planning; and this is fortun
ate. For it would have been a pity
to mar the beauty of some of the
most beautiful scenery in the world
by the introduction of roads and
houses in a haphazard manner.
Some of the natural advantages of
the west have been desecrated, but
enough have been appreciated and so
well treated as to shine as glowing
examples of what nature when com
bined with intelligent art can accom
plish. In the suburb people desire above
all else beauty of surroundings, and
they are willing frequently to put up
with considerable inconvenience to
obtain it. They will leave the apart
ment house or small city lot and
travel an hour or more, morning and
evening, to live in the suburb. They
will climb hills when they get there
to build their homes where is the fin
est view. They do require comfort,
but they must have beauty also if at
all possible.
The far west has realized this fact
and applied it with courage. In Oak
Knoll, Pasadena, an oak tree is val
ued at $1,000, some at more than
that.

BIG ALFALFA CROPS THE RULE
John W. Heffner, who owns a
choice forty on the Chandler ranch
adjoining the townsite on the north
has just finished harvesting the third
crop of alfalfa for the season. It cut
two tons to the acre, without a weed
in it. Across the street from Heff
ner’s place, George C. Smith has a
forty which will go over two tons
for the third crop. Heffner moved
his forty in April. He has thirty
acres in alfalfa and has already cut
in the neighborhood of 160 tons of
hay, which he has stored. The next
crop will be a seed one, and Heffner
and Smith are confident that it will
net them fully sixty dollars an acre.
Heffner paid $6,000 for his land. He
will pay the price of the land in al
falfa profits inside of two years.
