SMES AND MINING

THE GARCIA MINE.
The Recent Development Work are
Highly Satisfactory.
Development work on the Garcia
mine, situated near Wickenburg, has
continued unabated through July and
some very good results are shown.
During the month there has been a
total development of 156 feet at an
expense of $1,181.10. This has been
on the main shaft, east and west drifts
and in crosscuts on the same. An up
raise has been connected with the old
Garcia shaft which insures perfect
ventilation for all parts of the mine.
Crosscutting has been started in the
hanging wall in both the east and west
drifts. Very little ore has been en
countered in the east drift crosscut but
the west drift crosscut is highly min
eralized and the indications are good
that the ore body may be struck al
most any day.
Crosscutting in the foot wall will be
gin shortly and it is believed from the
floating strangers of quartz and small
ledges of high grade ore found all
through the mine that an immense
body lies beneath the foot wall. This
of course cannot be defined for
some time yet. There is a rich body
of ore in the east drift at the 200-foot
level and a winze will be sunk for the
development of this ore chute. When
the new winze reaches the 300-foot
level it will add materially to the ven
tilation of the lower workings of the
mine.
No attempt will be made to run the
mill continuously till this level is
reached though in September a test
run of 100 tons will be made from ore
below the 200-foot level in order to
show that the ore values are maintained
as depth is obtained. Altogether the
showing of the mine is highly gratify
ing to the management and stockhold
ers and it is believed it has a great
future.

CHLORIDE DISTRICT.
Progress of Development Work
Mohave County's Big Mines.

A correspondent in the Mining and
Metallurgical Journal of San Fran
cisco speaks as follows of the Chloride
district:
Mining in the Chloride district is ac
tive, due so by a number of rich strikes in
old and, to some extent, abandoned
mines, a number of which have been
reopened within three months. Those
that have been recently developed have
in every instance become ore produc
ers. The ore is found where work
stopped years ago. It is proven that
below water level the best ore is found.
The ore in a number of instances is
very rich in native and ruby silver,
which is usually accompanied by gold,
copper and lead.
The Tennessee mine has twelve feet
of ore in its 375-foot shaft, chiefly lead
carbonate, with streaks of wire and
ruby silver through it. Recent rains
have increased the water supply and
the concentrator is now run most of
the time. Within the past two weeks
ore on the dump has been lessened and
the concentrates shipped to Pueblo
and Denver.
The Elkhart mine is also in ore and
the concentrator is kept busy. The
shaft is down 400 feet, with much
crosscutting and drifting at this depth
in ore. This and the Tennessee are on
the same vein, separated by the
Schuylkill mine. The ores in these
mines are of the same character and
value. The Elkhart is working a
greater number of miners than ever
before, and many improvements have
been projected by Dr. T. B. Comstock,
the manager.
Cleeland Bros. & Cochran of Phila
delphia, owners of the Merrimac mine,
have been here, and, after an inspec
tion, decided to erect a concentrating
plant. In the meantime, J. M. Russell
is having preliminary work done at
the mine, which has a quantity of high
grade ore on the dump.
Colin Timmons, manager of the
Payroll mine, has a large body of lead
carbonates in that property. This is
a branch of the Tennessee lead, being
a few hundred yards southeast of the
Salter. It is of considerable size. This
ore is being shipped, the mine having
no concentrating plant, and no cus
tom work is done in the district.
The Mollie Gibson mine, which was
recently equipped with a steam hoisting
plant, remains idle. Several men
are working under the direction of Mr.
Grant, the foreman, but the ore body
is not being touched. The owners
and the purchase last spring, and all
are Montana men. K. J. Carter is gen
eral manager.
The northern terminal of the Ari-
zona & Utah railroad is now near Tu-
ba City.
THE RAY MINE.
The New Mineral District to Be Tapped
by a Railroad.
Mr. Buckingham is the successor of
Mr. George Ingalls, who was very
popular in Arizona as the representa
tive of Fairbanks, Morse & Co. At
the Ray camp Mr. Buckingham dis
posed of a steam hoist and air com
pressors which will be used in the
prospecting work which is to be car
ried on by the Ray company. There
are about forty men employed by this
company at the present time, and
operations have but fairly begun.
When the equipment is placed on the
claim there will be a larger force em
ployed. A stamp mill close to the Ray mine
will be started up soon to make the
first run of ore from the Ray claims.
It is an old mill and will be used sim
ply in prospecting the value of the ore
veins in a practical manner. Mr.
Buckingham thinks that the Mineral
Creek district is a wonderful region of
gold and copper, and he looks for the
development of some rich mines there
within the year. The great financial
strength of the Ray company insures
the expenditure of a great deal of
money on the claims of that company.
Mr. Buckingham spent Sunday at
the Adams hotel. In speaking of this
district he said, "The merchants of
this city supply the camp with
provisions and the ranchers furnish the hay and barley that is used
by the freighters from the Southern
Pacific to the camp. So the successful
development of this rich mining dis
trict is of direct importance to the Salt
River valley." "It is a long stage ride
to the Ray camp," said Mr. Bucking
ham, "but I understand that staging
will soon be done away with there.
The company proposes to build a rail
road to connect with the Southern
Pacific and when this is done a great
deal more attention will be paid this
rich district.
MINING NOTES.
It is reported that J. D. Moore of
Prescott thinks of trying to get up an
ore exhibit to be sent to the Texas
state fair, which will be in session in
Dallas for a month. A good many
Texas people are interested in mines
in Arizona and more could be induced
to become interested by a good ore ex
hibit. There will be people from all
over the Union at the fair.
According to the published report
the lode mines of British Columbia
have paid dividends to the extent of $2,126,465. This does not rep
resent the actual amount of dividends,
but is all the returns they have re
ceived. The deepest workings in any Cana
dian metal mine are to be found at
the pyrites mine, operated by the Eus
tis Mining company at Eustis, Quebec,
where the main shaft, on the incline,
is now down to the depth of 2,500 feet.
President Coram of the Cochiti G. M.
company has issued a circular outlin
ing the development at the mine to
date. He says the company has a
chute of ore which is opened to 600
feet in depth, 450 feet in length and
sixty feet in width, a block contain
ing 1,500,000 tons. As soon as the
mine is equipped to treat 10,000 tons
per month it is thought it will be up
on a dividend paying basis. Mining
and Metallurgical Journal.
The value of mine owners' associations in
protecting the interests of the industry
has already been felt in the short per
iod of eight years' existence of the
California Miners' association. The
influence for good has been extended
to the southern counties of California
by the formation of the southern Cali
fornia branch with a membership that
increases monthly as the objects, and
usefulness of union in a common cause
become known. By invitation from
this association the seventy-seventh
meeting at the American Institute of
mining engineers will begin on the
25th of September next in San Fran
cisco, after which the regular annual
meeting of the California Miners' as-
sociation will be held. It is the priv
ilege and duty of all who are inter
ested in mining to become identified
with this association and benefit by
these meetings and aid the proper rep
resentation of the importance of min-
ing in southern California. One of the
objects of miners' associations is to
promote and regulate legislative and
other measures, affecting the mining
laws and industry. Mining and Met-
It is reported that New York parties
have bonded the Robinson, Brooken
& Pitcher copper mines for $40,000.
These mines are located near the
Grand Reef mine on the Aravaipa side
of the mountains. The report also
says that $2,000 in cash was paid down.
Prospector.
H. T. Watson, a well known mining
engineer with headquarters at Salt
Lake City, is in Tombstone on mining
business.
Nat Faison has a number of men at
work on his claim in the Tortillita
mountains, says the Star. All of the
work being done at present is in the
way of development. The claim is a
most promising one, showing rich in
gold, silver, lead and copper. Steps
have been taken to have the claims
patented. Mr. Faison recently sold
another mining property for $40,000
and a portion of the money will be
used in developing the claim referred
to.
A. I. Ezekiel is in from the Dragoon
mountains where he has been in
charge of the Peabody copper mines,
representing George Fitzgerald. It is
learned from Mr. Ezekiel that Mr.
Jaycox paid Mr. Fitzgerald $25,000 for
which he received all of Fitzgerald's
right, title and interest to the property
by bond, option or otherwise, which
resulted in all suits having dismissed
and Mr. Jaycox's representative taking
peaceful possession of the mines.
Lyman Helm and General Peter
Widner were in town yesterday. Mr.
Helm is the brother of Dr. Scott Helm,
who was well known in Arizona. Mr.
Widner is from Dayton, O. Both these
gentlemen are interested in the South
Bisbee Copper company and have just
returned from a visit to the properties.
Speaking of the work of the company
they say that everything is progress
ing satisfactorily. The shaft is down
704 feet. At six hundred feet they
passed through a body of copper. They
expect to go down eight hundred feet
and then drift. The company has
forty-five claims, eleven of which are
patented and application for patenting
the remaining thirty-four has been
made. Star.
The Orb says that on Monday last
the final papers were fixed and signed
which bonds the Pete Connors gold
property in Carr canyon to Chicago
capitalists, represented by O. B. Har-
dy. A bond is taken on the property
for six months at a price of $10,000,
$2,000 being paid down. The property
is situated on the south side of Carr
canyon, on the divide, between that
and Millers. A number of shafts have
been put down on the ledge, one to a
depth of forty-six feet, which is all in
good ledge matter carrying free gold.
The ledge in some places on the sur
face is over twenty feet wide and reck
ons broken from any portion of it shows
free gold to a more or less extent. A
small sized gold nugget, about as big
as a pencil tip was taken out of the
shaft, which Mr. Hardy now has as a
pocket piece.

BOYCOTTED MEN BARRED.
Merchants in Cleveland Refuse to Sell
to Any One Patronizing the Cars.
Cleveland, O. Herbert E. Murray,
cashier in a large downtown jobbing
house, patronized boycotted cars, with
the result that since his first ride he
has been unable to buy anything in
the neighborhood of his residence.
Two nights ago Mr. Murray strolled
down the street several blocks from
his home into a district where he
thought he was unknown. Entering a
cafe, he seated himself and ordered
something to drink. The waiter looked
at him, waited away and did not come
back. Waiters passed back and forth
continuously, and to several of them
Mr. Murray called, but no attention
was paid to him. Eventually the head
waiter asked him to leave, and inform
ed him that, because of the boycott,
he could not be served. Mr. Murray
protested, went out and sought anoth
er drinking place, with the same re
sult. On the following day Mr. Mur
ray ordered a case of beer from a brew
ery, and it was delivered. Within
an hour an agent for the brewery ar
rived and asked for the case of beer,
offering not only to refund the price
paid, but double the money. He said,
in explanation, that the beer had been
delivered under a misapprehension,
and the company did not dare sell to a
boycotted man.
On another occasion Mr. Murray
dropped into the barber shop of Louis
Schwelmer. Schwelmer refused to al
low Murray to be shaved in the shop.
Mr. Murray's experience in buying
groceries was interesting. He first or
dered them of the grocery man near
his home from whom his family had
long purchased. He was refused. He
sent in an order to a large downtown
grocery house, which declined to de
liver the goods, but said that as an
especial favor they would sell to Mur
ray if he would send someone to the
store. Unfortunately he got them by
sending to the city. A shoe worn by
one of Murray's children needed slight
repairs, the cobbler who usually did
the Murray's shoe repairing refused to
do the work unless paid four times his
usual price. Murray's father, who re
sides with him, was in need of a plas
ter for his back. An attempt was
made to purchase one in three drug
stores, without success, each druggist
refusing to sell, and Murray, senior,
went without the plaster. William
Melvin, a grocer, said that every mer
chant on the south side had decided
not to sell goods to persons patron
izing the cars.
"When a person who has been 'spot
ted' comes in here and wants to make
a purchase," said Mr. Melvin, "I do
not refuse to sell. I simply advance
the price of my goods. I usually
treble the price of every article and no
person that has been 'spotted' has yet made purchases
at my advanced prices." Harper's
Weekly.

THE INGERSOLLS REFUSED HIM.
New York There is an unusually
interesting story back of the reauesr
made by Sculptor Wilson MacDonald
that he be permitted to make a death
mask at Colonel Ingersoll. The re
quest was made to Colonel Ingersoll's
family the day after the noted agnos
tic's death. The request was not
granted. Another sculptor, George
Gray Barnard, an old friend of the In
gersolls, made the mask.
Sculptor MacDonald is the oldest liv
ing American sculptor. He is an ag
nostic, a ardent admirer of Tom
Paine, and several years ago restored
the Paine monument at New Rochelle,
which had fallen into decay. He then
decided to make a bust of Paine to go
on top of the monument. But he took
ill and it was not until this year that
the bust was completed.
Mr. MacDonald is 80 years old. He
did not have the means to pay for the
bronze casting. Several agnostics or
ganized in committee and money
enough to pay the bronze company
was secured. But there was nothing
left to pay the sculptor. Mr. MacDon
ald wrote to Colonel Ingersoll and
asked him to lecture for the fund. It
was while the colonel was ill, and the
doctors had forbidden him to lecture.
But the aged sculptor's request that
he lecture for the benefit of the bust
and was granted, for Ingersoll knew
this sculptor was in straitened circum-
stances. He gave the lecture in this
year. It was Colonel Ingersoll's last
appearance before the public. It was
his last lecture, and the subject was
'Thomas Paine.' The lecture was a
great success. The bust was dedicated
a few days later but Colonel Ingersoll
was too ill to attend. Pittsburg Dis-
patch.
POOR PICTURES SOLD WELL.
The Paradox of This Year's London
Academy Exhibition.
The academy has closed its doors
and the art community has, as usual,
taken a reckoning of the monetary
aspect of the season, as compared with
those that have proceeded it. And
with this reckoning there comes the
discovery of a somewhat paradoxical
state of affairs.
Six months or so ago, in general, the
influential academician as well as he to whom a patron is an
event of a twelve-month, were com
plaining that never before had buyers
been so few and prices so low. When
the academy opened its doors it was obvious that this deplorable state
of affairs had not purred on the aver
age artist to any remarkable effort. By common in
sight the exhibition was the weakest that has ever
been displayed on the walls of Bur
lington House.
And here the paradox comes in, for,
despite this artistic insincerity, the
recent exhibition was the most popu
lar and the art sales in monetary suvs
cess for
sales amount; it to the while 1 1: l
year no less than $1,600 has been re
ceived by the academy annually for
the sale of pictures. Nor is this
amount made up chiefly of a few im
portant pictures sold at very high
prices, but rather of a multitude of com-
paratively unimportant "works the
average prices of which have been
moderate. Chicago Int. Ocean.
PAXCEFOTE REGARDED.
Sir Julian Pauncefote's elevation to
the peerage is an indication that the
English government appreciates a
man who may not talk much, but also
abstains from writing indiscreet let
ters, and attends to his business, doing
what the slang of the day describes as
"setting next." Pittsburg Dispatch.
