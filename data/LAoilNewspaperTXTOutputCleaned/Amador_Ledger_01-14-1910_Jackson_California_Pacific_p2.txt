PINCHOT'S DISMISSAL.

President Taft has summarily dismissed Gifford Pinchot,
chief of the U. S. forestry service. This action has stirred
up a lot of controversy, as no man in the public service
has commanded more attention than Pinchot, because of his
advocacy of the conservation policy in regard to natural re
sources of wealth in forests and water power sites. Pinchot
was early the originator of the conservation policy inaug
urated by the Roosevelt administration, and, in this work he
has accomplished an inestimable service for the benefit of the
country. As the father of this great reform he will ever
occupy a prominent place in history. It is to be regretted
that circumstances of his own making rendered his dismissal
imperative. He wrote a letter to Senator Dolliver criticising
the administration for not taking his extreme views on some
questions, and this letter was made public in Congress. Of
course there remained but one course open to the president,
namely to discharge the indiscreet official for insubordination.
Pinchot is evidently afflicted with swell-head. He has been
lauded and pampered to such an extent that he had conceived
an overwhelming idea of his own importance. He was a
"bigger man than Taft" in his own estimation, and doubtless
imagined he could criticise his superiors, and carry the ver
dict of the people with him. We take no stock in the ex
planation that Pinchot realized that he was inviting his own
discharge. On the contrary, he imagined he was entrench
ing himself in public opinion by his mutinous letter, and
that he could thereby promote the adoption of his extreme
views. His address to his subordinates in the service upon
his retirement partakes of the same spirit of insubordination,
in telling them that the claims of the people were higher and
more sacred than the claims of the administration — a truism
of course, but inopportune, and another covert slap at the
"higher-ups," and an incentive to rebellion. Without de
tracting from the important service rendered by Pinchot, we
believe the cause of conservation will not suffer by his re
tirement. A radical reform cannot be effected at one step.
It must be brought about slowly, step by step, as the people
become educated in the matter, and so avoid any violent
interference with vested interests.

A THRIVING BUSINESS.

The amount paid out for bluejay bounty this month was
$100 — a jump of one-third over the sum drawn from the
treasury on that score last month. Truly, the supervisors
have managed to develop a lively business in bluejay
destruction in the space of two months. Scalp bounty on
other predatory pests, so-called, footed up $100, making $200
as the toll upon Amador taxpayers in one month. This is
only a starter. The demands will no doubt climb apace,
until the county managers will be compelled to wipe the
bounty from the ordinance book. There is no valid excuse for a
county bounty law anyway. The abuses that grow up in the
wake of such laws is more than an offset to any real good they
can accomplish. Besides which the housewife is just as
much entitled to protection from the ravages of rats and mice,
flies and so forth, as the farmers and stockmen. Where is
the public treasury that could withstand the drain of a con
sistent policy on this bounty proposition.

Mayor McCarthy is not creating a favorable impression for
a successful administration of the affairs of San Francisco.
On the eve of taking his seat he publicly declared that he
owed allegiance first and above all to the trades unions — a
most unpatriotic utterance from a private citizen, and in ex
ceedingly bad taste from a mayor elect. In taking office he
launched out into a bitter tirade of abuse of the outgoing
administration — another evidence of unsound judgment.
Again, he has declared his unswerving opposition to the
bonds for the acquisition of the Spring Valley water system,
a going and paying business, at the same time working for
the impracticable Geary street car line. All this does not
augur well for the new administration.

Lettuce Salad With Fried Cheese.

Dress the lettuce in the usual way
with French dressing. Have a mild
cheese, rather dry, cut in strips like
French fried potatoes, dip the strips in
beaten egg, roll them in dry bread
crumbs and drop them into boiling fat
to brown as quickly as possible. Serve
with the lettuce.- Boston Post.

Passing Events.

Time is a sort of river of passing
events, and forgetting is the current. No
sooner is a thing brought to light than
it is swept by and another takes its
place, and this, too, will be swept
away.—Marcus Aurelius.

FITS OF PURE ANGER.

How to Know and Check This Dan-

gerous Tendency.

There is many a young mother who
admires secretly the little outbursts
of anger that baby gives vent to and
thinks they are funny and cute until
by the time the child is two or three
years old she awakes to the sad real
ization that her baby has grown into a
willful and spoiled child who is thought
unruly but forgivable and cute by all
other people. She then begins to see
what lack of discipline has done for
the baby. Every mother, out of jus
tice to the child as well as to herself,
should check these outbursts of anger
when the child first shows an inclination to indulge in them. But when
the mother finds that the outbursts
have taken a firm hold on the child
and seem to occur periodically she
should set about the tedious task of
overcoming them.

The little one should be punished,
but her will must not be broken by
repeated "spankings," for these seldom
fail to give the child a moody, sulky
disposition. It takes time and pa
tience to effect a cure. The best cure
for these fits of anger is to shut the
child in a room by itself whenever
they occur. A particularly successful
method of making a naughty child
good is to divert its attention from un
pleasant things. Children often have
as much to make them irritable and cross
as a grown person, and when a moth
er notices that a child is fretful it
takes but a minute to find an unused
toy or a new book or to suggest a new
and interesting occupation that will
brighten the child's mood and prevent
an outburst of anger before the child
can be aware of its existence.

How to Make a Lily Pond.

Aquatic plants for the home garden
are not grown as much as they should
be. Amateurs who hesitate for fear
of failure are wrong, for water lilies
require far less care than tender bud
ding plants and are less expensive.
Any swampy or boggy ground can
easily be converted into an aquatic
garden. Flowering shrubs, trees and

ferns will grow luxuriantly near a
pond. When you decide on the loca
tion of your pond, which should be at
the lowest point of the garden, dig out
the soil from eighteen inches to

three feet deep, depending on the
severity of the winters in your local-

ity. The lilies must be planted deep
enough to prevent them from froz-
ing. An inexpensive way to make the pond

hold water is to line it with common
clay. Cover the bottom and sides of
the pond with this clay two or four
inches thick and beat firmly until solid
and even. The best method is to plant
the water lilies in boxes or tubs. Use
very rich soil, as coarse as possible.
Rough pieces of sod and lumps of
earth should be mixed in. Boxes hold-
ing five or six cubic feet will accom
modate strong growing plants, and
others holding half that much will be
large enough for the weaker growing
plants. If the pond is large the soil
may be placed on the bottom and the
plants set out in it, but in smaller
ponds under this method, the roots of
the stronger plants will quickly cover
the bottom, crowding out the weaker.

said the young father. "Although I

best youngster I ever saw, I never
brag about him."-Kansas City Times.'
