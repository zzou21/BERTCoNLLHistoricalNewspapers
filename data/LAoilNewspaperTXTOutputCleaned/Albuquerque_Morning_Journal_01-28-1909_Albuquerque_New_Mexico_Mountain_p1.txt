Blow For Cause of

THREE HUNDRED
SIGN PETITION
HOOSIERS RALLY TO
SUPPORT OF ADMISSION
Practically all Former Indiana
Citizens in Territory Will Aid
in Movement to Convert Sen
ator, Hearing the signature of over three
hundred former Hoosiers, the petition
to Senator Hovcridge asking that he
withdraw his opposition to the state
hood measure now pending in con
gress was forwarded to the senator's
offices in Washington yesterday eve
ning on the Chicago limited. The size
of the Indiana colony in Albuquerque
is indicated by the large number of
signers to the memorial which can
hardly fail of a good effect in Wash
ington. The fact that three hundred
former citizens of Indiana live in Al
buquerque alone will be a pointer to
the cosmopolitan and enterprising
makeup of Albuquerque citizenship.
Similar petitions are being forwarded
from various parts of the territory as
a result of the movement proposed by
the Morning Journal.
From Las Vegas, where the pro
posal was made by Judge K. V. Long,
a petition bearing a large number of
names was sent to the Indiana sena
tor and others are being signed in the
other cities of New Mexico. If the
plan proposed by the local Indiana
club to get a resolution for statehood
through the Indiana legislature suc
ceeds the New Mexico Hoosiers will
have struck a telling blow for state
hood.

A CALL TO FORM ITS
BRANCH OF INDIANA
A communication to the former
citizens of Indiana residing in this ter
ritory drawn up by a Las Vegas com
mittee was received by the Morning
Journal last night accompanied by the
following letter from Judge Long
which is itself of added interest. It
is as follows:
East Las Vegas, Jan. 27, 1909.
Editor Albuquerque Journal,
Albuquerque, N. M.
Dear Sir: Some weeks ago believing that
a united effort by the present residents of
New Mexico who were former citizens of
Indiana upon Senator Hovcridge might induce
him to re-examine the statehood question and
finally to favor our admission, I published a
letter in The Optic along that line and called
a meeting of the Hoosier club of this city which
met on the evening of January 20th in our
city hall and appointed a committee to
take action on the subject. A letter
addressed to Senator Hovcridge quite
numerously signed has been sent to
him and the committee believed that
a general address to the Indiana people
in the territory might create an interest
that would induce them to address their
friends at home and bring some influence
to bear in that direction. I enclose you a
copy of a letter which will be published
in The Optic today which we would be glad
if you will publish, if you regard the
movement favorably and think it may
accomplish any good. Personally I
feel if Senator Hovcridge could be induced
to reconsider his views and favor the
measure that it would pass the senate.
Some days ago I wrote to various lo
calities urging like action.
Truly yours,
E. V. LONG
To New Mexico Hoosiers.
The letter follows:
Las Vegas, N. M., Jan. 27, 1909.
To Former Residents of Indiana, Now
Citizens of New Mexico:
The undersigned committee appointed
at a meeting of the Hoosier club
of Las Vegas, held at the city hall
on the night of January 20th, Inst.,
take this method on behalf of the one
hundred and fifty members of the
club, now residing in San Miguel coun
ty, to address the former residents of
Indiana who now live in New Mexico,
and to ask their co-operation in a
united effort to secure immediate
statehood for New Mexico, at the pres
ent session of congress. As citizens of
this territory we all know from per
sonal knowledge its fitness in all re
spects to become a state of the union.
Its splendid educational system,
equal to the best, its schoolhouses,
academies, colleges and universities,
distributed all over the territory; its
benevolent institutions which would
be a credit to an older commonwealth,
its numerous church buildings and
church organization, its fraternal so
cieties with large, influential and
intelligent membership, its large produc
tive and business interests, its increased
population, enterprises and wealth,
just prove to every fair and unpre
judiced mind, that New Mexico is far
better qualified to become a state in
the union than was the state of In
diana at the date of her admission;
and as well, that in all the elements
of good citizenship, she will today
compare favorably with the Hoosier
State.
We are proud of our old home
state, of her history, of her people,
of her achievements and statesmen
past and present. We recognize that
the senators of Indiana, and the mem
bers of the lower house of the past
have been, and of the present are of
commanding ability and influence.
We now that the senators of our
old home state today hold in the hollow
of their hands the future of the
statehood bill for the admission of
New Mexico, which will soon reach
the senate. We believe these senators
without reference to past opinions, are
now willing again to examine into the
fitness and right of this territory for
present admission, and willing to be
controlled in their action by the facts
as they now exist, by reason and jus
tice.
So believing, as a committee, on be
half of the Hoosier club of Las Vegas,
we call upon all the former citizens
of Indiana now residing in New Mex
ico both through their club organiza
tions and by meetings and individually,
to write to their Indiana friends
at the old home, soliciting their in
fluence with the Indiana senators in
behalf of the present admission of
New Mexico, and as well, that by let
ters and resolutions that they convey
to the Indiana senators in Washington,
not only the wish for statehood,
but as well a statement of the undis
puted facts, which prove our qualifi
cation and right to become as a state,
members of the federal union.
The president and president-elect
both are earnestly in favor of immediate
admission. Both the national
democratic and republican parties by
their national platforms are positively
pledged to immediate admission,
which pledge carries with it the hon
orable obligation to perform the prom
ise made to the people of the United
States. In New Mexico both political
parties gave the same pledge and
the leaders of the parties and the people
are attempting to carry it out.
Further investigation has induced
many representatives and senators
who were formerly either opposed to
this measure, or lukewarm in its sup
port, to change their opinions and to
become advocates of statehood. A
public sentiment has been aroused
throughout the nation so the time is
now opportune for a unanimous, su
preme effort to pass the statehood bill
at the present session of congress. On
behalf of the club we represent we
earnestly urge upon you immediate
and active co-operation with us along
the line suggested.

Fraternal Congress In Session.
Kansas City, Jan. 27. The Western
Fraternal congress composed of offi
cials of twenty-six fraternal organiza
tions who represent about 2,000,000
persons closed its session at the Ital
timoro hotel here today. C. H. Card
ner, of Dallas, Tex., was elected presi
dent. The societies adopted a resolution
protesting against the adoption of
high rates provided in bills recently
introduced in a number of state leg
islatures. New officers elected.
Carson, Nev., Jan. 27. United
States Senator Francis O. Newlands
was elected to succeed himself by joint
ballot of the Nevada legislature to

Delegates Howl When Candi
date for President Attempts
to Make Speech From Floor.
By Moraine Journal Special Wire
Indianapolis, Ind., Jan. 27. At to
day's session of the convention of the
United Mine Workers of America.
Vice President Farrington of Illinois,
demanded to know from the national
president whether or not the national
organizers present as delegates from
local unions were being paid from the
national treasury. President Lewis
declared that Farrington was "out of
order" and the delegates tried to howl
Farrington down when he attempted
to complete his speech.
When order was restored Lewis de
clared that when the time came the
question would be fully explained.
Lewis also said with much vehemence
that Farrington was charged with
some acts, referring to some charges
against Lewis, that he would first
have to answer to the convention for.
Frances Fechan, another anti-Lewis
man, demanded of Lewis what he
meant by his declaration that he had
not departed from the previous policy
of the organization in regard to the
pay of international organizers.
Lewis declared that in the past
when John Mitchell wanted to bring
International organizers to headquarters
he brought them. Indicating that

STATEHOOD

ACTION POSTPONED
President Roosevelt Congratulates
Governor of California
on Firm Stand Against Radical
Laws Against Asiatics.
(By Moraine Journal Special Lasted Wire)
Sacramento, Cal., Jan. 27. Despite
the agitation throughout the state
over the question of the enactment of
laws calculated to deprive Japanese of
the right to own land, to become
members of corporations and to live
wherever they please in the various
communities, the members of the lower
branch of the legislature decided
almost unanimously today to postpone
action on the pending bills for one
week. No determination will be
reached upon the action to be taken
next Wednesday until the letter of
President Roosevelt arrives.
Governor Gillett received a telegram
from the president congratulating him
and the legislature upon the consid
eration they had given the government's
desires and stating that a letter explaining
the situation was on the way and might
be made public if the governor so
desired.
The fact that the long expected
storm would not break today developed
this morning before the assembly
was called to order. A. M. Drew, au
thor of the bill prohibiting aliens
holding land, issued a statement that
he had agreed to put the matter over
until next Wednesday, when, in ac
cordance with the request of the state
department, he would amend his bill
so that all aliens would be denied
property rights, thus allaying the fear
that discrimination against the Jap
anese would result in serious compli
cations. Grove L. Johnson, author of the
alien corporation and segregation
bills, reluctantly consented to do the
same with his measures, and a vote
was not forced.
Johnson and the members of the
San Francisco delegation still stand
pat, however, on the passage of the
bills without amendment.
Governor Gillett and Assemblyman
Prew held another conference late
this afternoon, at which it was agreed
that the question should be dropped
until the receipt of the letter from the
president.
In the senate there
was less friction with the
Japanese delegation.
Saunders, who early in
the session introduced a bill similar
to Drew's, did not yield
today to give way to
the governor than
Senator J. H.
the session in
to Drew's, did
yield today to give
varying the theory
up the fight, and
that if anti-Japan
ese measures were forced to an issue,
President Roosevelt would send a
special message to congress asking
that the Nipponese be given the right
to become citizens.
The governor received the following
telegram from the president this fore
noon: "White House, Washington, D. C,
Jan. 27. Hon. J. N. Gillett, Governor
of California: I must again express
from the standpoint of all our people
my appreciation of the great service
that you are rendering. I have, abso
lute and entire faith in the judgment
and patriotism of the people of the
great state of California, and I know
that they will support you. My letter
is already on the way to you, and you
may make it public whenever you de
sire. THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
Senator Anthony introduced a reso
lution today calling upon congress to
request that the Japanese consul at
San Francisco be recalled by his gov
ernment, on the ground that he at
tempted to influence the action of the
California legislature. The alleged
offense is that the consul called upon
the governor and asked him to prevent
the enactment of anti-Japanese bills
pending. The resolution concludes:
"Whereas, the activities of the Im
perial Japanese consul at San Fran
cisco in attempting to prevent consti
tutional and lawful proceedings of the
legislature is an abuse of diplomatic
privileges, establishes a dangerous
precedent, constitutes a flagrant
breach of international courtesy and,
unless disapproved now, may justify
more pronounced activities toward
other legislatures as well as toward
other governmental departments.
"He it resolved, That the Imperial
Japanese consul at San Francisco is
attempting to prevent the due, lawful
and constitutional proceedings of the
legislature and infringing upon the
dignity, privileges and rights of said
legislature, and,
"He it further resolved, That the
California senators and representatives
in congress, through the proper offi
cial channels, be requested to present
the aforesaid activities of the Japanese
consul to the consideration of the state
department, with a view that said con
sul shall be admonished; that California
is neither Manchuria nor Korea,
nor yet a province of Japan, and that
said consul shall be sent back for such
action."
The resolution was referred to the
committee on federal relations.
Congress has a new ir
to introducing cox six

Senator Lodge and other members of

tions, congress would not take cogniz

IN
REPORT EXPECTED
DURING COMING WEEK
Measure to Contain Grants of
Land Instead of Cash, as
Has Been Custom in Past
When States Were Created,
Morning Journal Bureau,
Munsey Building,
Washington, Jan. 27.
Every effort is being made by the
house committee on territories to re
port the Arizona and New Mexico sep
arate statehood bills by the end of
next week. The statehood bill is be
ing framed by the republican mem
bers of the committee, but will be ex
hibited to the minority members be
fore the hearings are held by the full
committee. Representative Hamilton,
of Michigan, who has done most of
the work in preparing the measure,
has been in conference with the presi
dent, the secretary of the interior and
members of the senate with the ob
ject of having the measure meet the
approval of all in order to minimize
opposition, and if possible insure its
passage at the present session. The
bill probably will provide for grants of
land by the federal government in
stead of grants of money, as has been
done in some cases to the territories
that have been granted statehood.
These grants of land are primarily for
the purpose of liquidating certain ter
ritorial debts. A thorough investiga
tion of the debts, both county and ter
ritorial, in New Mexico and Arizona, is
being made with the object of deter
mining how much land should be
granted by the bill. It is proposed, it
is said, to give New Mexico two rep
resentatives and Arizona one at large
in the house. Governor Kibbey, of
Arizona, has joined the colony of
statehood boosters in Washington.
"Prospects are very bright for the ad
mission of Arizona to the union at this
session of congress," he declared.
"There will be no opposition in the
house, I am informed, but there is ru
mor that in the senate we may run
against an obstacle. I believe, how
ever, that we shall overcome any op
position, and that Arizona will join the
sisterhood of states before the end of
this session."

Los Angeles, Cal., Jan. 27. Advices
to the Associated Press from Phoenix,
Ariz., and also from Yuma, are to the
effect that companies of the national
guard of Arizona in these cities have
been instructed to hold themselves in
readiness to proceed to Globe, Ariz.,
at a moment's notice. Some days ago
the Old Dominion Copper company,
operating at Globe, posted notices dis
charging 1,010 men. It was alleged
that this action followed attempts by
agents of the Western Federation of
Miners to organize the men employed
in the mines.
No reports of any serious disturb

ON FATE OF STATEHOOD
Salary Question May Come up
Upon Demand of Treasurers

More Funds for Help,
By Special Wire to the Morning Journal.
Santa Fe, N. M., Jan. 27. Today's
sessions of the legislature were de
void of interest in point of work ac
complished as an average page out
of the Congressional Record. There
was no work to be done and no ap
parent desire to furnish any. The
council was in session for twelve con
secutive minutes when it adjourned
until tomorrow afternoon, and the
house, although it occupied the hotter
part of an hour listening to an inter
esting recital of the Journal of yester
day's proceedings in English and
Spanish, adjourned three minutes af
ter the reading had been completed,
without so much as listening to the
reading of a new bill. There are a
good many bills in committee, and
until some of these are ready to be
reported, there will be little doing in
the assembly. It is probable that lit
tle or nothing will be done in the way
of general legislation until next week,
and even then there is a possibility
that the legislators will have no in
clination to hurry.
There are several reasons for the
slowness in getting started to work.
The first is the absence of the usual
supply of pet measures. Aside from
the county division schemes only a few
of the members seem to have pet
measures, and as there is not a great
deal of opposition to them there is
consequently no need for haste.
Another and a stronger reason for
the inclination to postpone as much
legislation as possible pending some
definite news from Washington, is the
possible fate of the statehood bill in
the senate. Should it become appar
ent with the opening of next week that
the statehood bill has a good chance
for passage, there will be comparatively
little legislation at this session,
and such as there is will be postponed
as long as possible.
There is continued unrest in the
house about the employee situation. It
is for the most part a healthy unrest
and comes in large measure from men
who think that the house not only
has too many employees who are doing
nothing but draw pay, but that the
house is also paying too much for
them. In some quarters a disposition
to cut down the number of employees,
which was apparent in the opening
days of the session, is now stronger
than ever, and some reduction in the
length of the payroll would be no sur
prise. Moreover, the sentiment for a
law which would limit the number of
employees in the future to a reasonable
number of competent clerks and sten
ographers is even stronger now than it
was at the beginning of the session.
The present session, in fact, has
brought a more healthy sentiment in
regard to the employee graft for up
to this session it has been a graft
than has ever been apparent before.
It is too early to say that anything
further will be done in regard to the
employees. It is certain that the as
sembly will not attempt to exceed the
legal limit of the appropriation. But
it will not be a surprise if a very
strong effort is made for further reg
ulation on a more economical and
sensible basis.
County Officers on the Job.
There has been some agitation in a
quiet way today favoring increases in
the salaries in the lower class of coun
ties. The movement has its origin
among treasurers and assessors who
are not satisfied with the law of 1907,
under which the late lamented county
treasurer of Bernalillo county, Mr.
Heaven, is seeking to freeze to his four
percent. It is understood there will
be no effort to make the increase ap
plicable to counties of class A, which
includes Bernalillo and
ties, but that the demand will be
additional money for in-
come in counties of class B, the
allegation being that the as-
sors and treasurers in the Inter
mediate counties have paid their de-
bts, they will have no money left. The assem
bly is not likely to consider any meas
ure which will increase salaries in
counties of class A, and the matter as
regards the other counties has not yet
reached the introduction of a bill.
The subject of county salaries is one
to which Traveling Auditor Safford
has given much attention and he is
more familiar with conditions in coun
ty offices than any other man in
New Mexico. He is a firm believer
in the percentage salary with a maxi
mum amount such as is provided for
under the law of 1907. He is of the
opinion that there are several coun
ties where salaries might be raised
with an improvement to the public
service. He has not indicated what
his opinion is of the proposed addi
tion for clerk hire in the lower class
of counties.
The Council Session.
The council met at 2 o'clock this
afternoon and adjourned after listen
ing to the reading of three new bills.
Council bill No. 21, by Mr. Navarro
to compel prisoners in county jails to

COUNCIL PASSES

A BOND ISSUE

Will Be Placed on Sale March 1st, With Fifty Inquiries Already
on File From Prospective Buyers; Special Tax to be Levied
to Provide for Payment of Interest and Sinking Fund to be
Assessed Against all Taxable Property in the City; City
Council Holds Short Meeting.

At a special meeting of the city
council yesterday afternoon in the of
fice of the mayor, an ordinance was
passed under suspension of the rules
authorizing an issue of $250,000 san
itary sewer bonds of the city of Albu
querque in accordance with the re
sult of the recent special election. The
bonds are to be placed on sale March
first next until 5 o'clock p. m. The
city council will hold a meeting the
same night at the conclusion of which
the name of the successful bidder for
the bonds will be announced.
At the meeting yesterday afternoon
Chairman James H. Wroth of the
sewer committee, brought up the sub
ject of special employees to assist the
city engineer in the preliminary topo
graphical and other work which is to
begin at once with a big force of men
and be rushed to completion in three
or four months at which time the
construction contract will be let and
the long desired sewer system for
Greater Albuquerque will be actually
under way. Dr. Wroth also brought
before the council his proposition to
send the city engineer to San Fran
cisco to make a study of pipes and
concrete and other materials, the ob
ject being to secure as much expert
information about sewer construction
as possible to aid him in his super
vision of the work here. Owing to
the lateness of the hour, however, and
the fact that the aldermen were be
ginning to feel the pangs of hunger
the council decided to let the matter
go over until a special meeting which
will be held probably Friday.
The meeting yesterday was called
for 4 p. m. and adjourned about a
quarter to 7. Present were the mayor
and city clerk and Aldermen Auge,
Heaven, Coon, Conroy, Lemar, and
Wroth.
The bond ordinance was read. On
motion of Alderman Wroth, second
ed by Alderman Coon, the rules were
suspended and the ordinance was read
for the second time, finally being
passed on its third reading under sus
pension of the rules.
The mayor stated that he and the city
clerk had received as many as fifty in
quiries or tentative offers to handle
the bonds from bank companies and
loan houses and similar corporations,
judging that there will be no lack
of bids ready by March 1st.
The ordinance as passed is as fol
lows: Ordinance No. 111.
An Ordinance authorizing the issue of
$250,000 Sanitary Sewer Bonds of
the City of Albuquerque, New Mex
ico. Be it ordained by the City Council
of the City of Albuquerque:
Section I. That there shall be issued bonds of the City of Albuquerque
as follows: Two hundred ninety bonds
of the denomination of $1,000 each,
for the purpose of securing funds for

at a rate not to exceed four and one-half
per cent per annum, payable semi-

tioned herein are authorized by the
provisions of an act of Congress of
the United States of America, approv
ed March 4th, 1898, entitled "An Act
to amend an act to prohibit the pass
age of local or special laws in the
territories, to limit territorial indebted

sold for less than par.
Section II. All of the said bonds

pose of providing a sinking fund for
the payment thereof, and the proceed
ings of the said special tax shall be used
for no other purpose than the pay
ment of the said bonds.
Section V. The bonds provided for
and mentioned in this ordinance shall
be all disposed of to one purchaser,

TO INCREASE WATERWORKS
FORCE
Chairman Wroth, of the sewer com
mittee, submitted the following report,
which was referred to the committee
on finance for action:
To the Honorable Mayor and City
Council of the City of Albuquerque.
Gentlemen: Your sewer committee
would report that in view of the car
rying of the sewer bonds for the new
sewer system, that certain expenditures
are necessary in order to prepare
for the bids on the same. It is noto
rious that our engineering department
is very severely handicapped by lack
of means, and if we intend to have
these specifications ready within the
next ninety days it will be necessary
to put in the field sufficient of an en
gineering force to carry out the plans
made by Mr. Gray. Your committee,
therefore, suggests that the engineer
ing force be placed during the next
four months under the sewer commit
tee, and would recommend an increase
of force to six men, consisting of:
One rodman at $75 per month.
One levelman at $85 per month.
Two chainmen at $80 per month.
One draftsman at $100 per month.
One city engineer at $150 per month.
The salary of the city engineer dur
ing the next four months shall be raised
to $150 per month.
The mayor shall be left to the city en
gineer and the sewer committee to re
ceive this as soon as practicable, and
that this action and recommendation
applies only so long as the necessity
exists for preparation for bids on the
sewer system.
It is an evident fact that in a city of
this size our engineering staff has not
only been deficient in quantity, but
owing to the condition existing previ
ously to this council, all data has been
considered the property of the tempo
rary engineer, and as such the data in
the past is not in the possession of the
city, with the result that nothing is
in the possession of the city which will
show us to base any permanent fig
ures upon which to rest or carry out
any plans. A profile map
of all sewer construction is absolutely
demanded and if we are going to limit
ourselves to the present staff it will
probably take from four to ten months to
do the same.
This city has been sadly negligent
in providing a foundation upon which
proper data can be based, and it is in
tended to correct the same by this ac
tion. I would also suggest and rec-
ommend that the city engineer, as
soon as he has put his field staff at
work, be allowed a vacation of two
weeks with pay, for the purpose of
investigating the more recent improve
ments in reinforced concrete. I would
further suggest that the expenses of
this preparation for specifications be
borne by the sale of the bonds, and
for that reason, as above recommendation
was made, that the engineering
corps be placed under the sewer com

Washington, D. C., Jan. 27. What I

hearing session took place
this afternoon in the
house committee rooms of the
committee on appropriations,

He was asked questions
concerning the office, be

Congressmen whose
names have figured in the

cently.
For more details Mr.
Wilkie was plied with ques
tions in regard to the secret ser

The fact was brought out
though the limitation of ex
penditure of the money for the se
cret service last year reduced the
number of men employed by the se
cret service under Chief Wilkie to
those same nine men were in
the rolls of the department or ju
Chief Wilkie said counter that
the number of men employed by the
secret service had increased rapidly dur
ing the financial stringency, and it
was need of an increase in
the appropriation of the
last year.
