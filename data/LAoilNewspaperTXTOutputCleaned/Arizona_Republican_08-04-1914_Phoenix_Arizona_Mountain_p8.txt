Note the Patent Spring Trips. Now and increase your alfalfa yield from 25 to 50 per cent.

PLANET JR. IMPROVED

Alfalfa Cultivator
This Cultivator, by actual test, has cultivated to a depth of 7
inches in local soil and if properly used now, will pay for itself
in extra yield of Alfalfa. The PLANET JR. ALFALFA CUL
TIVATOR is strongly built, has Patent Spring Trips which is
the secret of success in Alfalfa Cultivation, for they cause the
Teeth to trip up on striking roots, rocks, etc. It is also a Gen
eral Purpose Cultivator and is an implement every rancher
should own. Come in or write for full particulars.
