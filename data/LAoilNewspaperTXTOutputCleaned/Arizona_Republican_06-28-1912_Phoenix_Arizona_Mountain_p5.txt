South Siders Clamber Up
to .500 Mark; Phoenix
Slips Down; 5-4 Score Re
sult of Nifty Contest at
Eastlake Park

VALLEY LEAGUE.

"Tb Won Lost Pet
Phoenix 2 2 .500
Tempe 2 2 .500

It would really be monotonous if the
games were not so fast.
For Tempe took yesterday's contest
at Eastlake park by that same old
score of one point more. The damage
this time read 5 to 4.
The southsiders went to bat first.
Mullen, the little wonder of all times
died easily under Smiley's chloroform.
Peterson got a two bagger and came in
on Griffen's neat sacrifice. Spikes and
Easaw each flew out and it looked
rainy for the Phoenix bunch.
The first three men for Phoenix
struck or flew out and the clouds gath
ered thick. In the second inning, Smiley
held them down however, and stocks
began to rise. That is until Tempe
took a break and slewed in two runs
in the fourth. It started this way.
Griffen went to bat and with great
style and eclat sent the ball skim
ming over the right field fence while
he trotted around 'em for a run and a
new hat from Hyder Brothers store.
He says he will take a straw this time
and he already has enough of the Stet
son variety. Spikes following him
fanned and Easaw glided past the
sacks for the other tally.
Phoenix' tries were all nipped as
were the Tempe bats until the lucky
sixth rolled around. It started with a
whoop when Eddie Scott copped a
sweet hit and stole second and third.
Jackson walked and was out at second
while Eddie and his brother Nash
made cinders fly for two needed
scores.
After the pitching battle everybody
started hitting again in the eighth and
Phoenix managed to drag two more
runs out of the scuffle.
With the score tied, Tempe's flag end
at bat and Phoenix coming strong for
the last try at the plate, the storm
clouds began to lower over the camp
of the southsiders. On Gabe's error his
third, Oviedo, scraped up a fifth
run in the ninth. Phoenix went in to
glom the game but for some reason
glomming wasn't good and their worthy
efforts were not rewarded a little
bit.
The game was really an interesting
one though not as close as the box
would indicate. There are some who
declare Tempe should have won by six
or eight to get some but even those
huskies pulled off their share of double
plays. On more than one occasion the
chance to make it a shut out was
flung into the bushes by players who
seemed unable to think quickly enough
in the tight places.
Calling it about a stand off between
Smiley's lack of crook and Clark's want
of control, the deciding factor seems to
lie in the infield playing. Gabe's three
mistakes and that of Ed Scott at first
were all too dear to allow for a real
winning chance.
The score by innings.

R. H. Greene Says Next

Winter Will Witness the
Largest Influx of People
This Valley Ever Had;
Phoenix Should Prepare

Mr. Greene says Phoenix is nearly
well known in the cities he visited,

R. H. Greene of the Greene & Grif
fin company, the Home Builders and
the Phoenix Building & Loan associa
tion, returned Wednesday night from an
extended trip east in the interest of his
various enterprises. He was particu
larly concerned in the sale of Home
Builders stock and bonds, in which he
was entirely successful. He left here
about the middle of May and visited in
Peoria, Bloomington and Henry, Ill.,
and in Anderson, Indiana, and Chicago.
Peoria was Mr. Greene's home before
he came to Phoenix and he is one of
those men who can always do the best
business among the people who know
him, a testimonial of confidence that
stands for much in a successful career.

Peoria has for years had many stock
holders in the Phoenix Building &
Loan association and many investors
in Salt River valley mortgages. During
the short period elapsing since the or
ganization of Home Builders that organ
ization has also numbered many Peoria
people among its stockholders. There
are now fifty-five residents of that city
who hold stock in either the Home
Builders, the Phoenix Building & Loan,
or both, their securities aggregating
$72,000.
Mr. Greene was in Chicago at the
opening of the Republican convention,
but two days walking the streets and
hotel lobbies with hardly a chance to sit
down was enough for him, although he
was very handsomely entertained at
the home of Dr. Loring, who is a heavy
investor in Mr. Greene's several enter
prises. Peoria is a very wealthy city, being
the largest distilling city in the world
and is the largest consumer of corn in
its distilleries, glucose and starch
works.
It has a very successful club, Creve
Coeur, where its business men take
their lunches and every night many
dinner parties are served. The city's
new hotel, The Jefferson, is a hand
some fire-proof building of 9 stories, so
well patronized that the adding of two
more stories is contemplated.
Peoria is a good convention city.
While Mr. Greene was there, the G. A.
R. held its state encampment there and
he had the pleasure of meeting in re
view his old regiment, the 47th Illinois,
and marched with about 100 who were
present.
The undertakers, grain dealers, trav
elers Protective Association national
convention, Shriners and several other
associations met in conventions, keep
ing the city filled with visitors and the
hotels crowded.
Speaking of the political situation,
Mr. Greene says he went away a Taft
man but the action of seating the dele
gates who were not entitled to seats
in all fairness caused him to side with
the friends of Roosevelt and he be
lieves he may be elected. There was
no possibility in his estimation of elect
ing Mr. Taft had there been a split
in the party. The people, especially the
common people do not and will not
support him. There is much to be of a
combination ticket of Roosevelt and
Bryan and if that can be brought about
it would carry the whole country.
Mr. Greene says Los Angeles is as
well known and he believes next
winter will see the largest influx of
visitors and investors ever known.
Correspondence with old friends and
every person that may be reached by
Phoenix real estate and other business
men will result in much good.
Crops throughout the Middle west
are very backward. The winter wheat
was a total failure, being winter killed,
owing to backward spring and much
rain. Oats, a big grain crop in that
section, is of small acreage and corn
late planted and backward and will re
quire late fall to mature. Many grain
dealers predict there will not be enough
wheat this year in the United States
for home consumption, none for ex
port. Under such conditions, it is not
hard to convince the people of the sta
bility of farming in the Salt River val
ley and a large influx may be looked
for this fall and right here he says he
would like to put in a work for a home
paper. The Progressive Farmer, as the
greatest medium of reaching the far
mer. Every real estate dealer and mer
chant and the board of trade should
see that this worthy publication be
sustained by advertising and sending
copies to their correspondents.
o

Following are some of the negro's beliefs
about ghosts:
To feel a hot breath of air strike
you at twilight signified the nearby
presence of a ghost. Should you wish
to avoid him, stop and turn your coat
and trousers and hat wrong side out
and the spirit cannot encounter you.
If, however, he is a pugnacious
sprite and approaches despite the
change, turn and address him thus:
"In the name of the Lord, what do
you want?" Whereupon he will tell
you his business upon earth, then de
part and never, never trouble you
again. If, on the other hand, it is a
prowling ghost who crawls under the
house, bumps against the floor,
makes strange sounds, and whimpers
in the midnight hours, you have only
to put in a new floor and he will do
so no more.
Some ghosts are obtrusive and will
not only prowl about the house, but
creep in through the crack of the
door in the wee small hours of the
night, and, once inside, expand to
vast proportions.
To spare yourself in this way, sow
mustard seed about the doorstep
just before going to bed, or place a
sieve on the doorstep.
Before entering, the spirit will have
to count all the holes in the sieve or
all the mustard seeds, and by this
time daylight will come and he will
have to go. As the counting for one
night will not do for another you are
always unsafe. Southern Workman.

GOVERNOR HADLEY JOHN WANAMAKER MEN

CHICAGO. June Governor Herbert S. Hadley of Missouri and John
Wanamaker of Philadelphia, both mentioned as possible Republican candi
dates for the presidency, are men of widely differing types. Mr. Wanamaker
was postmaster general in Harrison's cabinet before Hadley had cast his
first vote. Mr. Wanamaker has been a business man all his life, while
Mr. Hadley has been an attorney. Mr. Wanamaker was in Europe and was
delayed in returning, so he reached New York after the convention, to
which he is a delegate, had assembled; He came from New York in a
special train that broke speed records in its flight.
