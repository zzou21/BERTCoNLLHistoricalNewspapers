HEATED SEASON'S HEIGHT
Drawing Thousands Toward Redondo
Beach.
Redondo, July 29. (Special corres
pondence to the Republican.) Now
that the heated term is fully on, peo
ple are flocking seaward and Redondo
is getting its full share of tourists. In
addition to the healthfulness of its
climate, the fact that one of the very
best hotels on the Pacific coast is lo
cated here gives this beach greater
prestige than others can hope to ac
quire. Nearly all rooms are now taken
for the season and inquiries for accom
modations are coming every day.
Yesterday there were seven ships in
port, discharging cargoes, and the
eighth came in the evening. The consignments
were of lumber and oil, and
were principally for Los Angeles and
Redondo business firms.
This place is on a bluff overlooking
the sea and the location being com
manding, about ten o'clock in the
morning a sea breeze sets in and con
tinues during the day, while land
breezes occur in the evening. Then its
accessibility by land and sea makes it
desirable, for the Pacific company's
line of steamships, the State of Cali-

A CLEANLY AGE.
Twentieth Century Ideas Incline To
ward Sanitation and Preventatives.
Nowadays scientists believe that in
cleanliness lies the secret of preven
tion of diseases.
To prevent a disease, remove the
cause.
Just as unclean habits breed many
diseases, so careless habits will breed
dandruff. Improper use of another’s
brushes, combs, etc., will surely cause
dandruff, and, in time, will just as
surely cause baldness.
It is microbic infection, nothing more
nor less.

VERY ANNOYING
This Hardly Expresses What Phoenix
People Say of it.

Any itchiness of the skin is annoying.
Little danger in itching skin diseases.
But they make you miserable.
Doan’s Ointment is a never-failing
cure.
For Piles, Eczema, all Itching
troubles.
Phoenix citizens endorse it.
W. J. Cain, bookkeeper of the Na
tional Bank of Arizona, residence
North Center Street, says: “Some
itchiness of the skin annoyed me far
too long to be pleasant, and although I
experimented with remedies of various
kinds nothing brought absolutely posi
tive relief until I procured Doan’s
Ointment at the Brisley Drug Co.’s
store, corner of Adams and Center
Sts. The first application gave relief
and less than a box effected an abso
lute cure. Should there be a recur
rence of the trouble any time I now
know what to do to stop it.”

cents. Foster-Milburn Co., Buffalo,

Baseball Players and Foot Racers!
Louis J. Kruger, ex-champion long
distance foot racer of Germany and
Holland, writes, Oct. 27th, 1901: “Dur
ing my training of eight weeks’ foot
races at Salt Lake City, in April last,
I used Ballard’s Snow Liniment to my
greatest satisfaction. Therefore, I
highly recommend Snow Liniment to
all who are troubled with sprains,
bruises or rheumatism.” 25c, 50c, $1
bottle. Sold by Elvey & Hullett.

Some men may have had monkey
ancestors, but those who are always

HEAD SOLID SORE
Awful Suffering of Baby and
Sleepless Nights of
Mother.

CURED BY CUTICURA
Skin Fair as a Lily with no Scar
to Recall Awful Sore
Writes Mother.

“I herewith write out in full the be
ginning and end of that terrible disease,
eczema, which caused my babe untold
suffering and myself many sleepless
nights.

My babe was born seemingly a fair,
healthy child, but when she was three
weeks old a swelling appeared on the
back of her head, and in course of time
broke. It did not heal but grew worse,
and the sore spread from the size of a
dime to that of a dollar. I used all
kinds of remedies that I could think of,
but nothing seemed to help; in fact, it
grew worse. Her hair fell out where
the sore was, and I feared it would never
grow again. It continued until my aged
father came on a visit, and when he
saw the baby he told me to get Cuticura
Soap and Ointment right away.
“To please him I did so, and to my
surprise by their use the sore began to
heal over, the hair grew over it, and
to-day she has a nice head of hair, her
skin is as fair as a lily, and she has no
scar left to recall that awful sore, and
it is over eight months and no sign of
its returning.”
Mrs. Wm. Ryer, Elk River, Minn.

Cure permanent.” So writes Mrs.
Ryer, Feb. 25, 1903, six years later:
“Your letter of the 14th inst. received,
asking in regard to the cure of my baby
some six years ago. Well, the disease
has never returned to her head which at
that time was a solid sore on top and
down the back. Once or twice since
then a patch has come on her hand near
the wrist, but it finally disappeared
after proper treatment with Cuticura.”

“I have suffered with plies for thirty-six years.
One year ago last April I began taking Cascarets
for constipation. In the course of a week I noticed
the piles began to disappear and at the end of six
weeks they did not trouble me at all. Cascarets
have done wonders for me. I am entirely cured and
feel like a new man.” George Kryder, Napoleon, O.
