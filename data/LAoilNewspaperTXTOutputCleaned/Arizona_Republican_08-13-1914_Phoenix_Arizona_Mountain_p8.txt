THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, THURSDAY MORNING, AUGUST 13, 1914

Cesspools

Pollute
Milk
Neither can cows stand in and
ponds and give pure milk.
The public is demanding the inspection of the valley milk
herds, the enforcement of sanitary measures and pure milk.
We have learned that inspection is going to be very rigid and
that all necessary sanitary measures will be enforced. One of
the first requirements will be pure cool water.
Why not get a PUMPING PLANT NOW. Furnish your stock
pure, cool water, improve the health of all your livestock,
increase the yield of your milk and your income, which means
bigger profits for you.
We are making a specialty of the installation of pumping
plants, have a well-trained crew and can quickly install
you a plant just suited to your requirements.
We are state distributors for SAMSON WINDMILLS. We
have a big line of gasoline engines and pumping machinery.
WE DO NOT CLOSE ON THURSDAYS
