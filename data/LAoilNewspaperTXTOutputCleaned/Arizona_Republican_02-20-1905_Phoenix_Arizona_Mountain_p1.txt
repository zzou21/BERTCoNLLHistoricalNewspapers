**A SNOWSHROUD**

Assists in Hiding Signs of Moscow Tragedy

**ASSASSIN OF SERGIUS**

Refuses to Disclose His Identity. The Funeral of the Grand Duke to Take Place Thursday. Ancient Capital Still Feels Shock of the Crime.

Moscow, Feb. 19. A thin layer of snow today has dimmed the blood stains in Senate square. The windows of the palace of justice have been replaced and other hasty efforts have been made to obliterate the traces of Friday's tragedy. Evidence of it, however, is being found in the most unexpected places. Soldiers this afternoon discovered many pieces of the carriage in which the Grand Duke Sergius was riding when he met his death, and fragments of flesh were found at the twelve-foot parapet of the arsenal, mimicking the Napoleonic guns.

Until the funeral, which has been fixed for Thursday, Feb. 23, the remains of the Grand Duke Sergius will rest in the ancient dining room of the Chudoff monastery, to which throughout the day the people of Moscow have been admitted to pay their last respects, in parties of one hundred. This precaution was taken because it was thought necessary to avoid the possibility of a demonstration.

The assassin remains persistently silent. His identity has not yet been established and although the police have been trying diligently they have been unable to find any clues to any possible accomplice. The assassin's papers and clothes offer no means of identification and his pass was evidently forged and appears never to have been issued. His photograph has been taken, to be dispatched to all the universities, but if the assassin is actually a workman and not a student the police may find themselves at sea. The Grand Duke Sergius' coachman, who was thought to be dying at the time of the affair, is now alive and may recover.

The city presents an aspect of deep gloom. There is no music in the restaurants and there are no performances at the theaters. An Imperial manifesto, voicing the grief of the emperor, is posted on the street corners throughout the city and the crime still forms the only topic of discussion. Many mourning wreaths from royal personages and prominent officials have arrived and been placed in the monastery around the coffin.

**THE OTHER GRAND DUKES**

Remain Within the Fastnesses of the Kremlin.

St. Petersburg, Feb. 20. It has now been definitely decided that the remains of the Grand Duke Sergius will not be brought to St. Petersburg for the present but will be placed in a temporary receiving vault in the Cloister of Chudoff monastery to await the completion of alterations now in progress in the Romanoff mausoleum in the fortress of Saints Peter and Paul. On account of lack of space in the mausoleum it was decided last year to henceforth bury only the rulers of the dynasty in the old mausoleum and a new sepulchre in the new wing of the cathedral is now being built for other members of the imperial family.

So grave is the danger of a repetition of the Moscow tragedy that several grand dukes have not stirred out of their palaces since the murder.

**MOURNING IN NEW YORK**

A Requiem for the Soul of the Murdered Sergius.

New York, Feb. 19. At the Russian cathedral of St. Nicholas a "panikhida" or requiem mass for the Grand Duke Sergius of Russia was celebrated today. The scene was most impressive as the great congregation holding lighted candles responded to the chants of the black-robed priests officiating at the catafalque, which had been placed in the center of the edifice.

Rev. Alex. Hotovitzky, the pastor, in his sermon said that the assassination of Sergius was a sad blow against the real freedom of Russia; that the act of the assassin would not bring about a betterment of conditions, but that violence would retard the liberal tendencies of that country; that the act furthermore was not perpetrated by Russians or by men who had the welfare of Russia at heart, for no real patriot would throw a bomb into the Kremlin, which is a sacred place. Russia, said the preacher, was maligned and calumniated throughout the world, and many of the infamous charges against the Russian government were wholly untrue and other happenings were exaggerated for political purposes.

**EDWARD'S CONDOLENCE**

London, Feb. 19. King Edward and the prince and princess of Wales paid a visit of condolence today to Count Benckendorff, the Russian ambassador here.

**JAPANESE SYMPATHY**

But Reason Is Found for the Crime.

Tokyo, Feb. 19. Commenting on the assassination of the Grand Duke Sergius at Moscow the Jiji Shimpo expresses its sympathy at his cruel death, but declares that the action was attributable to the high-handed manner of the Russian government in suppressing the recent labor demonstrations. The paper says that oppressive measures against an expression of a national wish invite such outrages from the oppressed.

**THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE**

St. Petersburg, Feb. 19. Emperor Nicholas received through Ambassador McCormick a message of condolence from President Roosevelt, which contains a strong expression of abhorrence with which both the American government and the people view the crime perpetrated at Moscow on Friday.

**ARRIVING RUSSIANS**

Naval Officers Paroled After the Fall of Port Arthur.

San Francisco, Feb. 19. Three paroled Russian naval captains and eleven lieutenants arrived here today from Port Arthur en route to Russia on the steamship Siberia. The party consisted of Captain N. O. Von Essen, commander of the battleship Sevastopol; Captain E. Spensnovtsh, commander of the battleship Retvizan; Captain N. A. Saxe, commander of the naval transport Yermack; lieutenants Bestoujev, Rumin, A. J. Bezestuzeff, V. Beklemishev, V. Butkevitch, K. Krotkoff, B. Ostelzki, A. Rigex, S. Tirtov, P. Wesslken, V. Denissoff and S. Kovalevski.

The naval officers had no criticism to make of General Stoessel or his conduct of the defense of Port Arthur beyond the fact that the Russian fleet was undermanned and had not a sufficient supply of ammunition when the war began.

**SAID STOESSEL WAS A COWARD**

Victoria, B. C., Feb. 19. Aboard the steamer Tartar which arrived today were Lieutenants Below and Bondy, officers of the Russian cruiser Sevastopol, captured at the fall of Port Arthur. They were released by the Japanese after giving their parole.

Lieutenant Below characterizes Gen. Stoessel as a coward. "The world will know Stoessel as he is," said Below. "He is a coward. Stoessel was buried a great deal of the time in a cave. The real heroine was Madame Zouboff, who, when her husband was killed, took command of a battery of three 11-inch guns at a point commanding the water supply and held them until she was also killed. The garrison was deceived by false reports of the approach of Kuropatkin's army and the Baltic fleet."

A number of outbreaks have been started recently by the Russian prisoners at Matsuyama.

**RUSSIANS FORTIFYING**

Tokyo, Feb. 19. Field Marshal Oyama reports that the Russians are continuing their defensive works in all directions. They continued to shell portions of the Japanese line on Friday, on the same day they essayed a small infantry attack but were repulsed.

**IN LARGE NUMBERS**

Chinese Bandits Pouring Out of Mongolia to Aid Japanese.

Harbin, Feb. 19. A party of Japanese and Chinese bandits destroyed the abutment of a railway bridge near Yaomen, 100 miles distant from here, early this morning, but the damage was repaired in a few hours. These attempts on the railways are believed to have been made to cover the movements of large bands of Chinese bandits across Mongolia.

**BRITISH STEAMER CAUGHT**

Tokyo, Feb. 19. The navy department announces the seizure of the British steamer Kilviana bound for Vladivostok with Cardiff coal. The place where the seizure was made is not stated.

Too Much Excitement Already in Colorado

**Gov. Adams Discourages a Labor Demonstration In His Favor at the Capital Next Friday.**

Denver, Feb. 19. Governor Adams disapproves of the demonstration in his favor at the capitol on March 2, which has been proposed by the building trades council of this city and in deference to his wishes the labor organizations may decide to hold mass meetings elsewhere instead of assembling at the capitol.

The governor says: "In the present excitement of the public mind I deem it unwise for the people to assemble en masse at the state capitol on March 2, as intimated in the resolutions published. I am not surprised that the threatening danger to the ballot and free government should awaken the people, but this is a time for calmness and not excitement.

"So humiliating has been the failure of the Peabody side in the contest, so complete the annihilation of their phantom evidence that there can be no question as to the verdict. No honest man who has read the testimony can for a moment doubt my right to the governorship. So clear is this that I am willing to trust to the integrity of the legislature that their sense of justice and their duty to Colorado will master even the strongest partisanship."

**A JAPANESE LESSON**

It Teaches What May Be Done With Cotton

The Manufacturers of This Country May Profit by It in Making Use of the Raw Material.

Washington, Feb. 19. Some figures just supplied to a distinguished member of congress by the department of commerce and labor, through its bureau of statistics, suggest the possibilities which await the cotton manufacturers of the United States when they may find time to enter seriously upon the task of turning into the manufactured state the cotton produced in this country and now supplied in the natural state to the manufacturers of other countries.

The figures in question show merely the exportation of cotton manufactures from Japan to China during the term of years, but as Japan draws largely from the United States the raw cotton with which it produces the manufactures in question the suggestion which they offer is naturally an interesting one to us. These figures of exports of cotton manufactures from Japan to China show that the total value of cotton yarns exported from Japan to China in 1893 was $29,580, and in 1903 $14,112,507; and of other cotton manufactures in 1893 $221,783, and in 1903 $2,013,547, making the total of cotton yarns and finished cotton manufactures sent from Japan to China in 1893 $251,363, and in 1903 $16,126,054.

Meanwhile the quantity of raw cotton exported from the United States to Japan has grown from 793,242 pounds in 1893 to 161,601,219 pounds in 1900, the value of the same being in 1893 $68,423, and in 1900 $12,712,619. The quantity and value in 1903 were somewhat reduced by reason of the very high price of American cottons and the fact that Japan in years of high prices in America turns for a part of her cotton supply to India, where she finds a shorter staple and therefore lower prices. The general fact, however, that Japan increased her purchase of our raw cotton from $68,000 in 1893 to $7,500,000 in 1903, and in the same period increased her sales of manufactured cotton to China from $251,000 in 1893 to $16,000,000 in 1903, suggests the possibilities which await the cotton manufacturers of the United States when they may choose to turn the cotton produced into the finished state before permitting it to pass to the cotton consumers of the world.

This industry, which has recently sprung up in Japan, of buying American cotton, turning it into the manufactured state, and selling it to other countries is, of course, merely a reproduction of a process which has been going on for many years in the older manufacturing countries of Europe.

The United Kingdom, for example, took in 1903 $125,000,000 worth of cotton from the United States, basing this statement upon our figures of exports to that country; in the same year exported $322,000,000 worth of finished cotton goods and $36,000,000 worth of cotton yarns. Germany in the same year bought $85,000,000 of cotton from the United States, as shown by our own figures of exports to that country, and exported $80,000,000 worth of cotton manufacturers, of which $71,000,000 was finished goods and the remainder yarns.

France took in 1903 $35,000,000 of cotton from the United States, basing this statement again upon our export figures, and exported $35,000,000 worth of cotton manufacturers, practically all finished goods, the quantity of yarns exported being less than $1,000,000 in value. Japan, as already indicated, took in 1903 $7,500,000 worth of cotton from the United States, as indicated by our expert figures, and exported $20,000,000 worth of cotton manufactures, of which but $4,500,000 was finished goods, while $15,500,000 was yarn.

The fact that yarns form a much larger proportion of Japan's exports of cotton manufacturers than is the case with those of European countries is apparently due in part to the fact that her manufacturing establishments have not yet reached that stage of perfection in the production of finished goods which the older countries of Europe have attained; and in part, also, to the fact that the people of her largest customer, China, utilize yarns largely in the household manufactures of cotton cloths for domestic use, especially in years of high prices of finished goods. This is also true of cotton exports of India, which in the year ending March 31, 1904, amounted to $31,000,000, of which $28,500,000 went in the form of yarns, largely to China and other oriental countries.

Figures recently compiled by the bureau of statistics show that the world's exportation of cotton manufactures amounts to about $653,000,000 annually, of which $400,000,000 goes in the form of cloths, $152,000,000 as miscellaneous finished goods, and $101,000,000 cotton yarns. Of the $653,000,000 worth of cotton goods thus exported by the various countries of the world for which statistics are available, the United States, although producing three-fourths of the world's raw cotton, exported in 1904 but $22,500,000 worth of cotton manufacturers, of which $14,700,000 was cloths, $7,500,000 miscellaneous finished goods, and $172,300 worth cotton yarn. In the same year, 1904, her imports of cotton goods were $117,000,000 in value, or more than five times as the exports of cotton goods in the same period.

**CONFLAGRATION RECORD**

A Blaze in Denver Costing a Third of a Million.

Denver, Feb. 13. The Symmes block, a three-story structure, occupied by stores and offices, was destroyed by fire today, entailing a loss estimated at $300,000. The cause of the fire has not been determined. The heaviest loss is the Grand Leader department store, whose loss of stock, fixtures, etc., aggregates $125,000, with insurance amounting to $95,000.

Other losses are, the Symmes estate owning the building, $100,000, insurance $72,000; John Carson and Bro., china and glassware, $13,500; Simon Pros., jewelry, $10,000; the Barrios Diamond company, $3,000. The latter losses are fully covered by insurance.

**A TEXAS FIRE**

Tyler, Tex., Feb. 19. A disastrous fire raged here at an early hour this morning. Seven business houses were consumed. The loss is $150,000.

**MILLION AND A HALF**

The Loss in an Indianapolis Warehouse District.

Indianapolis, Ind., Feb. 19. For four hours tonight the wholesale district bounded by Georgia and Meridian streets, Jackson Place and the Union depot sheds was menaced by a fire which started in the wholesale warerooms of the Fahnley and McCrea Millinery company. When the fire was brought under control eight buildings among which were three hotels, had been completely destroyed, causing a loss estimated at $1,500,000. Firebrands fell in a perfect storm over the business portion of the city and on every building were stationed companies of men with fire-fighting apparatus and a general conflagration prevented.

**POPULAR FATALISM**

Bishop Lawrence Combatted It in Dr. Rainsford's Pulpit.

New York, Feb. 19. The pulpit of the Rev. Dr. W. S. Rainsford was filled last night by Bishop Lawrence of Massachusetts. "There is a vast amount of popular fatalism abroad," said the bishop in his sermon. "We hear people say that it's no use taking a hand in politics because one cannot do it and preserve individuality. If a young man turns to business it is said that the trusts and inventions may thrust him out. And so it goes through everything.

"But these ideas are erroneous. We should not acquiesce so easily in habits and customs as if all things were predestined. We should not succumb to conditions. In spite of the skepticism of modern science, spiritual, not material, forces reign."

The bishop said that hard training is required of men in these days to make them efficient for any kind of work. "Men must read and study to keep abreast of the changes. No man who is posted can retain the convictions of boyhood or even of ten years ago. Only men of breadth and character will be tolerated among men and women of simple faith."

**TO DRILL FOR OIL IN ARIZONA**

Indications in the Neighborhood of Tonto Basin Favorable.

Los Angeles, Feb. 19. The movement to drill for oil in the neighborhood of Tonto Basin, Ariz., seems to be taking on definite shape.

Local oil men who have visited the region say that there are excellent indications of the presence of petroleum, such as seepage and general geological formation. The location is within a short distance of the government's irrigation works at Tonto Basin, where oil is now being brought from California at an expense of about $5 per barrel, including a wagon haul of 60 miles.

**SENDS NEGRO WOMAN $25**

She Wrote J. H. Hyde After Recent Ball That She Liked a Good Dinner.

Kansas City, Feb. 19. Mrs. Mary E. Yancey, an aged colored woman, presented a money order for $25 at the post office here yesterday. It had been drawn and was signed by James H. Hyde of New York.

When questioned as to how it came into her possession she stated that after reading of Mr. Hyde's $100,000 ball, she wrote him a letter telling him she was a poor negro woman and liked a good dinner herself. In return she received a post office order from the wealthy New Yorker.

**CAUGHT SHAVING $20 PIECES**

Rancher in Snohomish, Wash., Robbed Coins of Eighty Cents Each.

Seattle, Wash., Feb. 19. George W. Hess, a ranchman of Snohomish, is now in the custody of Captain B. W. Bell, chief of the local street service, charged with "shaving" $20 gold pieces. Gold pieces to the value of $300 were seized, and the machine with which the man was doing his work has been found at Everett.

Hess is said to have cut from the edges of each gold piece 80 cents worth of metal. The coin was then remilled.

**NIXON ON HIS WAY TO RUSSIA**

**MONTANA DIVORCE SEQUEL**

Helena, Mont., Feb. 19. The house this afternoon passed Representative Bennett's bill preventing the defendant in a divorce suit where unfaithfulness is charged from re-marrying within five years and then only on proof of good behavior.

**FIRE LOSS ON OCEAN VESSEL**

Plymouth, Feb. 19. The steamer Sophooles from Brisbane, N. S. W., reports that a fire on board during the voyage did $125,000 damage. Several of the crew, while fighting the flames, were overcome. They were rescued with difficulty.

**FURTHEST SOUTH IN AUTO**

Boston, Feb. 19. Charles J. Glidden cabled today that he had arrived at Bluff, New Zealand, the most southern point in the world ever reached by an automobile.

**SPITTING CRUSADE IN PA**

Mahanoy City, Pa., Feb. 19. The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis will urge the legislature to pass a bill making spitting in public places a misdemeanor.

Boards of health throughout the state approve the measure, which provides for the placing of cuspidors in public places and carries a provision for a $5 fine for each violation of the law. There is no imprisonment clause in the proposed law.

**SUICIDE IN BURNING OIL**

Jealous Farmer Shoots Wife, Fires Tank and Jumps In.

Sistersville, W. Va., Feb. 19. Linsey Owens, a farmer, fifty-five years old, maddened by jealousy, it is alleged, shot at his wife and, thinking he had wounded her fatally, walked to the farm of a neighbor, set fire to an oil tank and plunged into the burning fluid. When the body was recovered it had been burned beyond recognition. Mrs. Owens may recover.

**A HOT CONTEST**

Promised in the Senate Over Statehood Bill

**WILL GO TO CONFERENCE**

In Event of a Recess by Senate Conferees There Will Soon Be a Strong Continuing to the Last Moments of the Session.

Washington, Feb. 19. The senate will begin the week with a consideration of the motion to appoint conferees on the joint statehood bill. The general understanding is that this motion will prevail and that the bill go to conference. In case the committee recedes from the important senate amendments a sharp contest will probably ensue.

**AT THE LAST MOMENT**

Washington, Feb. 13. The statehood bill is to be considered in conference by the house committee during the week, but there is nothing to indicate that an agreement will be reached before the session is in its last moments.

**KANSAS CITY MARKETS**

A Review of Prices and Conditions of the Past Week.

Kansas City, Mo., Feb. 19. Offerings of cattle from distant points were scarce last week, but Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma each contributed a few. Prices on steers were a little lower each day until Friday, by which time receipts had dropped down so sharply that packers found themselves unable to get enough cattle for local trade without active competition, and since that time the market has gained 15 to 30 cents on steers. Colorado and Panhandle killing steers, 1250 to 1300 lbs., sold at $4.35-$4.75. Cows and heifers got better all of last week and gained 15 to 25 cents in price. Full western cows sold at $3.25-$3.75 and one drove of western heifers at $4.05. Stockers and feeders did not change much, as the supply is small, and the cold and stormy weather made the demand quiet. Prices ranged from $3.25-$4.23 for fair to good cattle. Run of cattle, 2,000 head; market active and 15 cts. higher than close of last week, and called the busiest since the first of January. The present advance is probably temporary on account of abnormal conditions, but it is hoped a part of it will stick.

All sheep and lamb price records at Kansas City were passed last week, but market yesterday was 13 to 23 cents higher than last week on lambs. 13 doubles of which make up the supply. Light western lambs, 63-70 lbs., sold at $7.70, and 68-72 lb. stock sold at $7.75. In the condition of the market, choice heavy lambs would make $8.00. Western yearlings closed last week at $6.25-$6.75, wethers $5.25-$5.83, up to $5.25. Prices on sheep were tested yesterday as nothing but bulls were received. Most of the supply of 29,000 head last week came from the Arkansas and San Luis valleys in Colorado. Present prices look dizzy. If they stand without a serious break, it will be a fine commentary on the foothold the mutton men have planted in consuming centers in the last few years.

**GUN PLAY IN CHURCH**

Cumberland, Md., Feb. 19. Yesterday Walker, the class leader, escorted Miss Agnes Spiker of Lonaconing at Methodist church at Frostburg night and was leading the singing when James Rehman, aged twenty-one, arose and pointed a revolver at him, declaring in loud tones that he would kill him. He was ejected and the meeting was continued. Walker soon saw Rehman outside a window pointing a revolver toward him and sought refuge behind the pulpit. The meeting was broken up.

**EIDERDOWN ROBE COSTS LIFE**

Chicago, Feb. 19. An eiderdown robe cost Mrs. Mary Dennison her life. With the garment buttoned about her, a spark from a gas stove ignited it and in an instant she was ablaze. Before assistance reached her fatal burns were inflicted.
