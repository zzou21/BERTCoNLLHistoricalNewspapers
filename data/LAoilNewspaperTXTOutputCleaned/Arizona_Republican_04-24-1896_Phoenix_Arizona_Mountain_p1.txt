THE UPPER COUNTRY
Doings of a Week at
Mesa City.
Amateur Theatricals and a Surprise Party.
A Worthy Society that Seeks the
Preservation of Relics of a
Prehistoric Time.
MESA, Ariz., April 22. (Special
Correspondence of The Republican.)
The boys who went to represent their
lodge of the grand lodge I. O. O. P.
(recently held at Prescott), came back
with the idea that Prescott people did
not know how to entertain. They say
that they had a royal time, of which there
is no doubt; such affairs are usually
very enjoyable.
The Lorraine-Barlowe company ap
peared in "Trilby" at the opera house
on Tuesday night. This famous drama
was presented in a masterly manner
and a treat is expected in their presen
tation of "Jane" Friday evening.
The M. I. A. committee will give a
ball at the Co-op. hall on Friday even
ing. As usual a pleasant time may be
expected.
The young ladies of the Y. L. M. I.
A. association tendered their retired
president, Miss E. Pomeroy, a pleasant
surprise party on Monday evening.
In order to show their appreciation of
her past leadership they gave her a
handsome present.
A. L. Hendrix is spending the week
with us looking after the bicycle busi
ness. The thrilling war drama from
"Sumter to Appomattox," which was
to be presented on Friday, will be
given on Monday and Wednesday,
April 27 and 29. The militia boys are
enthusiastic about the play and by
their earnest efforts and those of
Professor J. Nelson, a good rendition
may be expected.
Miss Mary E. McNeil and Mary
Wingar, two of Tempe's charming
young school ma'ams, were callers on
Monday.
VENEZUELAN QUESTION.
London Papers Still Harping on the
Attitude of the United States.
LONDON, April 23. All the after
noon papers commented on the dis
patch from Washington to The Times
which its correspondent is said here to
have been instructed to publish, con
cluding with the remark: "This de-

lay us most perilous. The Washington
executive still shows a strong desire for
an honorable and reasonable agree
ment on the Venezuelan question, but
it takes two to make a treaty."
The St. James Gazette says the
statement that Mr. George W. Smalley
was instructed to publish shows the
United States government still hopes
we shall help them out of the difficulty
by surrender. When it is finally con
vinced of its mistake what will happen?
The Globe remarks: "If the Ameri
cans are wise they will understand
that the Marquis of Salisbury's at
titude means the steady determination
of Great Britain not to allow interference
in what she rightly considers to be
her own business."
The Pall Mall Gazette says that it
sees no reason for alarm. On the
other hand the Westminster Gazette
urges the Marquis of Salisbury to set
tle the Venezuelan question out of
hand even at the cost of losing his pride.
RUSSIAN RED CROSS.
The Society to Send an Expedition to
Abyssinia.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 3. France
has notified Russia that the former will
permit the Russian Red Cross detach
ment going to Abyssinia to cross the
Obok territory.
The Russian Red Cross expedition
referred to has aroused considerable
comment in Europe. It was fitted out
in Russia by popular subscription.
The outward object is the succor of
wounded Abyssinians. It is led by
General Shevedorf, who has as as
sistants Captain Svejadin, the Rus
sian explorer of Abyssinia, Lieutenant
Kocho-visky, an engineer officer, ten
surgeons, six assistant surgeons, six
ty attendants, one paymaster and three
interpreters. It has been hinted that
these surgeons are really Russian army
officers of different ranks ready to aid
actively the Abyssinians.
COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM.
Tennessee Convention Condemns the
Cleveland Administration.
NASHVILLE, April 23. The Repub
lican state convention convened today
and elected delegates to the St. Louis
convention, who were instructed for
McKinley for president and H. C.
Evans of Tennessee for vice-president.
The platform adopted renews the
party's devotion to reciprocity, protec
tion, sound finances, progress and
human liberty; demands readjustment
of tariff so as to afford protection rea
sonable and adequate; calls for reciproc
ity agreements, condemns the adminis
tration of Cleveland; endorses the
Nicaragua canal and demands the
early adoption of a policy that will
bring the war to Cuba to an end.

Make an Assignment to Their
Creditors.

Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of
Tempe Brings three Attachment
Suits.
There was considerable excitement
in business circles yesterday over the
report that the firm of Wildman-Pet
ers-Goldman of Tempe had made an
assignment for the benefit of their
creditors. The firm was considered
as solid as the rock of Gibraltar and
its news of the failure was at first
discredited.
Late Wednesday night Sheriff Oraie
went to Tempe and attached a section
of land valued at several thousand dol
lars. The attachment was for the sum
of $3,500 and was instituted by the
Farmers' and Merchants' bank.
The first attachment was followed by
two others against the firm filed by
Mons. Ellingson and the Farmers' and
Merchants' bank. The first was in the
sum of $11,000 and the other for $1,200.
The first was for an amount loaned by
the bank on a wheat deal and the
other was an indebtedness assumed,
brought about by the defalcation of
Larry Napier, a contractor on the
Normal school.
Yesterday morning in order to pre
vent their other creditors from attach
ing the firm they made an assignment
to J. B. McNeil, head clerk in the
store. According to their statement
the total liabilities of the firm is $37,260
and the following are the principal
creditors: Sach Bros., San Francisco,
$1,500; Baker & Hamilton, $1,000;
Standard Oil Co., $1,200; H. B. Claflin
& Co., $1,200; Hart, Bond & Co., $400;
Farmers' and Merchants' bank, $9,000;
Murphy, Gram & Co., $400; Baker &
Hamilton, $1,000; Byron Jackson, $100;
Morgainthail & Co., $600; Buckingham
& Hecht, $250; M. Wormser, $2,000;
J. S. Armstrong, $3,000; H. P. Tude,
$1,500; E. Olsen, $1,000; H. Ohnisk,
$1,000; Strauss & Co., $1,200. Besides
these debts there are numerous other
debts ranging from $100 to $300.
According to the statement filed
with the recorder the assets will cover
all outstanding indebtedness which
is set at $65,000, classed as follows:
notes, $16,000; stock, $25,000; miscell
aneous, $2,000. In addition the firm
owns real estate valued at nearly
$13,000 which, however, is mortgaged
for $10,000. Even if the property and
stock is sold at one-half its listed price
the assets are sufficient to free the
firm from debt.
The firm has been doing business
for many years at Tempe and was
always considered a staunch institution
and their failure can only be ascribed
to their making some unfortunate deals
and doing too much of the credit sys
tem on their books. It is supposed
that the firm will shortly be doing its
usual good business and such is the
hope of every merchant in the valley,
for each of the gentlemen comprising
the firm have records for honest,
square dealings and there is no doubt
that creditors will receive dollar for
dollar.
WILL DO AWAY WITH COAL.
Southern Pacific Locomotives Will
Burn Petroleum.
San Francisco Chronicle: The South
ern Pacific company has for some
months past been experimenting with
petroleum as a substitute for coal as
fuel on its locomotives, and the officials
are so pleased with the result of the
experiment that they have decided to
do away with the use of coal entirely
on all the locomotives operated by the
company south of Fresno.
W. G. Curds, engineer of the mainte
nance of way department, said yester
day that the uncertainty of the perma
nency of the oil supply in southern
California had caused the company to
hesitate before equipping all its loco
motives with tanks and spraying de
vices, but it has been decided to use
oil in lieu of coal on both the San
Joaquin and Los Angeles divisions
without further delay.
"Should the supply of oil turn out
to be unlimited," he added, "we will
use it all over the Pacific system.
"We have been experimenting with
the new fuel for some time past, and
the results have justified the change.
It has been found that the use of pe
troleum effects a considerable saving
to the company. We have been burn
ing oil in two engines for the past
few months and we have found that
four barrels of petroleum, or 1,200
pounds of fluid, does the work of one
ton of coal. Coal costs us $5.50 a ton
down there, exclusive of the cost of
handling it from the seaboard to the
point of distribution and consumption.
Oil is selling for 60 cents and 75 cents
a barrel, so that a perceptible saving
is to be made by using petroleum for
fuel. The company has let a contract
with a Los Angeles firm for the erec
tion of two storage tanks at that
place with a total capacity of 160,000
gallons. The materials will be ordered

The Flesh of a Young Lion Is So
Sweet and Palatable.

Tucson Citizen: Heretofore the
killing of mountain lions has been done
in the interests of stockmen who sought
by the payment of a given sum to rid
the country of a lot of predatory brutes
whose fondness for colts, calves and
fat shoats too frequently led them to
impinge on the purse strings of the
rancher. As an article of food the
genus Felis has never held high place
as the cuisine of civilization except at
such times when Tabby and Tom in
cidentally found their way out of the
small end of a sausage machine. It is
known, however, that Mexican hunters
never leave the carcasses of dead lions
to coyotes and buzzards, but use the
flesh for food. Others who have tried
it report it not only palatable, but
really good. Hon. Zack Vail who re
cently visited his ranch in the Santa
Catalinas, reports having dined for a
whole week on the flesh of lions killed
thereabouts. On reaching the ranch
it was nightfall and when supper had
been prepared he was asked if he
would have a plate of stewed venison.
He would and did. Later when com
plimenting the cook on the delicate
and toothsome flavor of the venison
he was told that he had fared sump
tuously on the flesh of a mountain lion,
which had been killed on the preced
ing day. He was a little disconcerted
at first, but in the morning the pleas
ant memories of the night before still
lingered and his regular steak went the
way of the stew. For dinner a steam
ing pot roast graced the board and met
a like fate with equal relish.
In the opinion of Mr. Vail the flesh
of a young lion is sweet and palatable
and the equal to that of any deer ever
killed. There is nothing of the strong
gamey flavor that characterizes the
flesh of the bear and even the smaller
of the mammalia. Prejudice has,
however, been educated against it and
the flesh of the lion will hardly ever
be much sought after by the gourmands,
but all the same it will occasionally
come in handy with a good square
meal for a hungry man.
THE CEDAR VALLEY MYSTERY.
Finding of a Body in a Shaft and the
disappearance of a Weed Chopper.
Two weeks ago the body of a man
was discovered in an abandoned shaft
sixty miles south of Kingman in the
Cedar Valley mining district. The
body was nearly naked and was in an
advanced stage of decomposition, so
that it was impossible to identify it.
The shaft was filled with water to
within eight feet of the surface, the
body being found floating on the wa
ter and was buried without the form
ality of an inquest. It has since de
veloped that the skull had been crushed
in from behind with some blunt in
strument, and the body had evidently
been carried to this old shaft and
thrown in, after having been stripped
of clothing. A strap around the waist
was probably used to assist the assas
sin in carrying the body to the spot.
A man who had been chopping wood
for the mining company has disappeared,
leaving behind a sum of money due him.
It is believed that the remains found
are his. His companion has also dis
appeared and is suspected of having
murdered him. Officers are searching
for the latter, but with little hope of
finding him. Both were Mexicans.
A DEAD PHILANTHROPIST.
London Papers Eulogize the Deeds of
Baron de Hirsch.
LONDON, April 23. The newspapers
here this morning are full of accounts
of the death of Baron de Hirsch, the
distinguished Hebrew philanthropist,
telling of the loss which his death will
be to charities, the turf and especially
to royalty, to members of which it has
long been common gossip that he lent
vast sums of money in matters which
are much discussed in the clubs.
ATTACKS THE MINISTERS.
A Rome Newspaper Violently Censures
the Government
ROME, April 23. The Tribune,
commenting upon the rupture of peace
negotiations between Abyssinia and
Italy, violently attacks the government,
declaring the ministers to be responsi
ble for the dishonor suffered by Italy
through King Menelik's attitude.
A GENEROUS GIFT.
BOSTON, April 23. The Harvard
university has received a gift of $100,
000 from a Boston donor whose name
is not made public, for the establish
ment of a department of comparative
pathology.
GREATER NEW YORK.
ALBANY, April 23. The assembly
has passed the greater New York bill
over the vetoes of the mayors of New
York and Brooklyn.

Bill to Admit Oklahoma Re
ported Favorably.

Two Congressmen Have a Fight and
Several Blows Are Exchanged.
WASHINGTON, April 23. The
house committee on territories today
decided by a vote of 6 to 2 to report
favorably on the bill to admit Okla
homa to statehood.
Congressman Money, Democrat of
Mississippi, and Congressman Hall,
Democrat of Missouri, had a personal
encounter in the committee of naval
affairs today. Felix McCloskey, a
messenger standing at the door, heard
Hall say "I'll allow no man to call me
a liar." With these words he planted
his fist on Money's face. Before
Money, who is no match physically
for Hall, could recover himself, Hall
grabbed a large glass inkwell and hurled
it at Money. It struck him behind the
ear, cutting an ugly gash; Money fell
back against the wall. At this juncture
McCloskey crowded between them and
prevented further onslaughts.
There is a strong possibility that the
delegates from the territories who
have statehood bills in charge will not
attempt to secure congressional action
until next session. Delegates Catron
and Murphy made a canvass of the
house since the New Mexico and Ari
zona bills were reported and encoun
tered obstacles which lead them to
believe the bills will command more
votes next session than in the present
one.
EQUALS PROFESSIONALS.
The Amateur Production of a
Successful Affair.
"Jane"
The Lorraine-Barlowe company was
greeted last night by a large and in
telligent audience to witness the pro
duction of "Jane." To judge from
the generous applause and hearty la
ughter the company was accorded the
credit due them. It must be said that
"Jane" as a mirth provoker is above the
ordinary plays.
The Lorraine as "Jane" was a de
lightful surprise. She proved herself
an emotional actress in the character
role of "Trilby" Monday night, but as
the laughable servant girl she was the
embodiment of comedy. The lines of
light and shade of pretense and reality
were so clearly drawn that it is read
ily agreed that Miss Lorraine is a very
versatile actress.
Elwin Barlowe as "Chas. Chekelton"
and spendthrift showed up more lik
ely against the background of tragedy
given by this actor at the last perform
ance. As a "comedy heavy" character
he is very successful.
Mr. E. E. Ford as "William," con
firmed the opinion of the public that
he is a comedian, and draws laughs
from people as well as critics.
Mr. O. C. LiaccilG's Mr. Markham
added new laurels to this young man's
name as an amateur actor.
Mr. Peter E. Dunn's "Fitzsim" was
character and showed talent of a high
order as a mimic.
Col. Cotton as "Mrs. Fitch" was a
very prominent character in his
role. The general actor is a success
as an actor.
Mr. E. Proctor took air, "Clarjde"
was the fresh servant to perfect him.
Mrs. Nolan proved herself no stranger
to the footlights in the part of "Mrs.
Chadwick," and was as funny as her
cork-screw curls.
Mrs. E. E. Ford as the lovable "Lucy
Norton" was charming, with stage
presence seldom found outside of the
professional.
Taken in all "Jane" was a most suc
cessful play. The amount of attention
paid to detail in costume and stage
business gives much credit to the man
ageiment. A special train runs to King
ton tonight to "Jane" returning after
the performance.
HEAVY LOSS.
THE HAGUE, April 23. An official
dispatch from Biritavia says the en
dangered post in Achin territory has
been relieved after a fight with the
rebels under Toeckdjohiam, who lost
seventy killed and had two hundred
wounded. The Dutch loss was one
officer wounded and thirty-three killed
and wounded.
SENATOR TILLMAN'S SPEECH.
OWENSBORO, Ky., April 23. Hon.
Ben R. Tillman, senator from South
Carolina, spoke to 5,000 people here
this afternoon. His rousing speech
caused much enthusiasm, especially
his denunciation of the financial policy
of President Cleveland.
On Saturday next the Alkire company
will offer a special on negligee shirts
and spring suits. Many of these goods
will be sold at less than New York
prices. They have a large lot to select
from and will retail at the closest fig
ures.
