ENCOURAGED

ON MOTOR TAXATION

Hon. Claude Kitchin, Chairman, and
Members of the House Ways and
Means Committee, Washington, D. C.
Gentlemen:
As the spokesman in an organized
form of the motor car owners of the
country, we did not seek a hearing be
fore your committee, as we are of the
opinion that the present comprehensive
use of the automobile is entirely clear
to all of you. There are a few points
however which, briefly, we would like
to bring to your attention.
Of 1,798,600 motor vehicles produced
in 1917, less than 3 per cent sold at
$1,500 or upwards. Three out of every
four cars cost not over $1,200. These
1,365,000 represented 76 per cent of the
total. Every other car was of a cer

tain popular make selling close to
$500. Farmers were the best buyers
as a class, absorbing 53.1 per cent of

the total vehicles manufactured.
Our investigations recently by chair

men of the good roads, legislative,
and touring boards supports anew the
contention that the passenger automo
bile is now nine-tenths for utility and

scarcely one-tenth devoted to what has
been designated as "pleasure riding."
True it is that vacation periods may
be spent in the form of interstate road
journeys and there may be local even
ing and Sunday trips, but the fact re
mains that a preponderating percent
age of the car's mileage is employed by
members of the family to crowd more
work into one day than was ever be
fore possible.
If your committee decides that there
should be substantial taxation of an
essential like highways transportation
and all forms are considered we
shall accept without protest your find
ings, believing that war revenue nec
essities demand such action.
Railroad conditions have compelled
an increasing use of the highways, to
the extent that long-distance traveling
is more general than in previous years.
The figures come to us through the
distribution of thousands of maps by
the road bureaus at our national head
quarters in Washington and New
York, besides which we supply our

several hundred clubs in all parts of

the country.
One illuminating example of what
can be done where a highway is con
structed capable of meeting present
maximum traffic demands, ex
ists in a forty-mile stretch of Ohio road
connecting Cleveland and Akron. A
census for a week, taken in March by
students of the Case School of Ap
plied Sciences, gave a total of 13,979
vehicles, of which only 685 were horse
drawn. Fifteen per cent of the total
were motor trucks, which carried 5,014
tons of freight as compared to 6,630
tons shipped by three railroads.
Thirty-three thousand people were
transported in passenger automobiles.
Proposed levies upon users of gaso
line motors and engines would amount
to about one-quarter of a billion dol
lars. Purchasers of new cars, of course,
would pay the tax imposed on the
dealer, who would "pass it along" to
the consumer. The gasoline tax would
be determined by the car's mileage,
which undoubtedly would be reduced
to a minimum. A federal license tax
in addition to that now imposed in all
states is manifestly unfair, and espe
cially so if based on the original price
of the automobile. All these would be

largely a tax on industry, and it would
seem unreasonably excessive on one
branch of industrial activity, already
taxed heavily by the states.
The proposed taxes will hamper the
agencies of production, the fuel and
the power they employ. We might as
well tax coal as gasoline, which is do
ing more than any other agency to re
lieve the conditions resultant upon the
scarcity of coal. It is estimated that

the power generated by gasoline ex
ceeds that generated by coal and
steam nearly ten to one; the horse
power produced by steam being esti
mated at about 11,000,000 and that by
gasoline at over 100,000,000.
In these days when our social sys
tem is on trial, one of the chief con
cerns of the congress should be the
safeguarding and the promotion of the
sources of national wealth, this to the
end that we may endure the great and
prolonged strain to which the war will
subject us. Industry is the greatest
source of national wealth. Is it good

economics to tax this greatest source

go anywhere you want to

go in 1918.

In the opinion of some of the Akron
tire manufacturers, the salvation of
motorists, when the big curtailment in
tire production begins to be felt seri
ously, depends almost entirely on the
quality of tires they use.
It is now generally known that for
war reasons the output of each pneu
matic tire manufacturer for August
and September of this year has been
cut to 50 per cent of the output for
the corresponding months last year.
It is also stated on the best of au
thority that no definite improvement
of the situation is apparent just at this
time. Scarcity of tires seems immi
nent. Therefore, it is argued, the con
sumer who fares best will be the one
who purchases the longest wearing
tires.
"A shortage of tires would naturally
mean a greater demand than ever for
the highest grades of casings and

tubes," declared K. C. Millhoff, general
sales manager of the Miller Rubber
company, to newspaper men the other
day. "The silver lining in this parti

cular war cloud is the fact that the tire
manufacturers were never in position
to give the motor car user such a big
return on his investment as they are
today.
"In our own case, for example, we
know that our product never before
reached the high stage of perfection
that it now maintains and, of course,
this is true of many other companies.
"A few years ago we set at work to
make Miller tires uniform in wearing

qualities. There were those who
laughed at such an idea. They argued
that as long as tires were built by dif
ferent men, those tires would have dif
ferent qualities. Our theory was that
if the men were of uniform experience
and workmanship, the tires would be
uniform. Within the last year, Miller
Uniform tires have been perfected,
our theory proved practicable and I

can say conservatively that this one
make of tires alone will represent a
saving of thousands of dollars in tire

bills to motorists during the coming

months.

"Not only will the demand be for
tires that wear the longest, but it will
include tires that give maximum rid
ing comfort, thereby adding to the

life-time of the cars equipped with

them. A buoyant, resilient tire one
that neutralizes road shocks will add
surprisingly to the service of the car
itself. And, that is just what consum
ers want nowadays, they want the big
gest possible return on every invest
ment that pertains to motor vehicles.
"In this connection, it should be re
membered that there is a great pos
sibility of a much more serious short
age of cars than of tires. Therefore,

buy your new cars and tires now and
get only those of the best quality.
Cheap goods have no place in the af
fairs of today."

"The closed type of motor car is
coming into favor rapidly," says Bert

O. Brown, local Chevrolet dealer.

"People are coming to more and more
appreciate, the wide range of utility
it affords.
"Much more is demanded of a motor
car today than ever before. It must
be, first of all, a utility car, fit for any
kind of service. It must be able to
furnish, at all times, economical trans
portation. It must afford comfort and
convenience at all seasons of the year.
If it answers a double purpose like the
convertible type, all the better.

"Naturally, in seeking the ideal util
ity car, the merits of the sedan or
coupe assume a new significance. Here
is a machine which is really two cars
in one. It is an exceedingly comfort
able and enjoyable car to travel in, if

the weather is wintry or tropical. In
summer, it is an open, easy riding
touring car. In winter, a warm, roomy

closed car as comfortable as a cozy
den. The up-to-date model of this
type can be converted from a closed
to an open car in a moment's notice
without changing the body. Special
receptacles are provided into which the
windows and posts are deposited. The
roof is permanent.
"We are often prone to regard any
important innovation as a luxury. It
was so at first with the closed car.
But now it is possible to secure this
style at a modest figure and on ac
count of the double purpose it renders,
it is becoming a very popular type.

In all there are three types of
closed car mounted on Chevrolet
chassis two sedans and a coupe. Five
passenger sedan types of bodies are

mounted on the "FA" and Four-Ninety
chassis, and two passenger coupe on
Four-Ninety chassis."

Points of Interest in the Automobile

Blue Book was originally a part of

the Plymouth Colony. It was settled

on grant from Plymouth to 26 resi
dents of that town in 1666. The deed
was signed in 1669 by Wamsutta and
his wife, Meetamo, the price paid then
being 20 coats, 2 rugs, 2 iron pots, 3
kettles, 8 pairs of shoes, 6 pairs of
stockings, 12 hoes, 3 yards of cloth,
in payment of a small debt owed by
Wamsutta to John Barnes.

The following extract from a letter
sent by the Stanley Motor Carriage
company of Newton, Mass., to the Ari
zona Steam Motors Co., the local dis
tributors of the Stanley Steamer is of
interest to auto owners here:
"We have on good authority that the
government has given every phase of
the situation serious consideration,
and has concluded that concerns that
are producing 1,200 cars or less, should
be encouraged to go ahead instead of
discouraged, as their factories and
facilities are not well adapted to the

government work to good advantage.
The government knows of course, that

passenger cars are a necessity, and
also it knows that it must eliminate
the unnecessary use of pleasure cars.
We have good reason to believe that
our car will be looked on with favor
because of the limited production of
our factory and the general economy
of operation."

BUILT IN COLONIES

Large manufacturing centers may
boast of the progressiveness and de
velopment they have brought about in
their communities, and yet the Auto
mobile Blue Book assures us in its
"Points of Interest" that Richmond,
Indiana, has the first Colony Factory.
This consists of several independent
manufacturing plants under one roof,
supplied with heat, power and light
from a central plant.

"SOMEWHERE

HOUSES MADE GET-AWAY

How would you like to own a gaso
line well not an oil well but an
honest-to-goodness gasoline well whose
product you could pour directly into
the fuel tank of your car, and then
crank up and go on your way rejoicing?

It sounds almost too good to be true,
but H. O. Waterman, loyal citizen of
Ventura, California, and Maxwell
dealer under Harold L. Arnold, of
Los Angeles, has found just such a
well, a short distance north of Ventura
on the road to Ojai.
The well which, incidentally, has
established a new world's record for

quantity production of extreme high

grade, has produced as high as 135

barrels per day of "oil" of 56 to 57
gravity. When it is considered that
the average gasoline that you buy

today tests about 58 gravity, it can
be readily seen that the new well is in

a class decidedly by itself.
Waterman brought pictures of the

well, and of himself pouring its product
direct into the gasoline tank of his
Maxwell, and he declares that the
Maxwell apparently did not have the
slightest suspicion but what it had
been fed a high-grade refined gasoline.
At any rate it assimilated the natural
gasoline without giving the slightest
hint of difficulty.
The new well is a good indication of

the wide range of California's oil prod
ucts. The big Montebello field near
Los Angeles, of which so much has
been heard recently, produces vast
quantities of oil, but it contains practi
cally no gasoline. No gasoline what
ever results from putting the Monte
bello oil through the ordinary distilla
tion process. While the Ventura well's
product, when bleached with acid to
remove a yellow tint, is virtually a
good high-grade gasoline and nothing
else, without any distillation process.
A considerable quantity of water
accompanies the gasoline in the Ven
tura well, but it does not occasion any
difficulty. So light is the "oil" that
separation from the water is instant
as quick as the settling tanks are
reached.
"I suppose a good many people will
be inclined to be skeptical about the
existence of such a well," said Water
man. "I'll admit I was a little skeptical

myself until I actually burned some of

the product in the Maxwell."

"Harry I. Radcliffe, a real estate
man of Houston, Tex., has discovered
a new ideal way of spending a vacation

without the usual worry of railroad
connections and the customary incon
venience of having to rely upon the

hotels for accommodations," says Mr.
Roper of the Roper Motor Company,
distributor of the Maxwell and Chalmers
cars for Phoenix. "This is in the form
of a specially constructed Maxwell 'every-purpose'
body, which was designed
by Mr. Radcliffe, and which he has been
using, accompanied by his wife, for
touring the United States.
Equipment Is Complete
"The car was beautifully planned and
executed, the body being thoroughly

rain-proof. The interior equipment

contains the following:
"An electric fan, three electric lights

operated by a switch, two water tanks

with a capacity of four and a half
gallons each, three mirrors along side
walls and one in front to show the

roadway behind, ten windows covered
on the outside with copper screens
and within by silk curtains, a patented
two-burner alcohol blast stove for
cooking purposes, writing table and
stationery, a rack filled with periodi
cals, a revolving chair for the person
seated to the right of the driver, rub
ber matting on the floor, upholstery in
Spanish leather, two large lined draw
ers to permit the carrying of lettuce,
tomatoes, celery and season's fresh
vegetables, also meat, eggs, butter,
etc.
"There is storage space for consider
able canned goods and provisions to
last on a tour of many weeks' duration.
There is also plenty of room for the
couple to carry several complete
changes of clothing and a surplus
supply of alcohol for the stove and
gasoline for fuel.
Uses "Dust Deflector"
"The car completely stocked with
provisions weighs approximately 3,050
pounds, and rides so easily and free
from vibration, that there is practi
cally not a rattle nor a squeak despite
the fact that it carries tinware, cook
ing utensils and dishes.

"A well devised locking arrangement

makes it possible for the owner to
leave the car on the beach or road
way, be gone for hours or days without
fear of anyone entering it.
"Two of Mr. Radcliffe's very special
features are a dust deflector adjusted
behind the car, and a curtain arrange
ment used in conjunction with the
windshield so that the draught can
be directed to any part of the interior
of the car.
o
Consistent tire and mechanical per
formance are two requirements that
contribute immeasurably to economical
operation of an automobile. A car
that is fitted with the proper sized
tires to carry its load, and with a
motor that can be depended on in all
emergencies, is a delight to any motor
ist. B. P. Lisenby of Mt. Vernon, Illi
nois, states that his experience with
Goodyear tires on a Buick car has ex
tended throughout a period of nine
years, during which time he has been
obtaining approximately 20 miles per
gallon of gasoline, and a tire mileage
that is excellent.

These things are money.

King Brothers' Cyclery, 110 East Ad

factory.
The King boys have re-arranged the

latest models exhibited in an artistic
manner on racks. They say that the
last month was one of exceptionally
good sales and that the demand for bi
cycles showed a gradual increase from
the beginning to the end of the month.
They say that with this increased de
mand for bicycles comes a call for the

that traffic congestion which is so
vexing a problem to all communities.

The importance of a mile depends
upon how quickly it can be traversed.
It has been made comparatively unim
portant by the automobile.
