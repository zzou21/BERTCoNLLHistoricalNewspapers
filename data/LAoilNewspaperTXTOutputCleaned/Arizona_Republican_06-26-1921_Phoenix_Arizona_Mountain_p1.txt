Believe Challenger Will
Attempt To Keep Out Of
Harm's Way Until Open
ins Presents Itself

MANHASSET, N. Y., June 25,
Taking his cue from the merciless
sun, Georges Carpentier waded into
two of his heaviest sparring partners
and lambasted them for five rounds
today. His smile was absent and he
actually appeared to be working seriously. . .
Big Paul Journee, his broken nose
and a black eye hidden behind a
mask, came out first. He worked
alone for ten minutes while Georges
punched the bag and jumped the
rope.
Georges vaulted into the ring and
was immediately at work. The mask
appeared to give Journee courage, as
he waded into the challenger. Georges
contented himself with punching
to the body. He hit Journee many
times, but there was a noticeable
checking of the blows. They were
heavy enough, however, to start Journee
pulling, and he rested while Chris
Arnold, a light heavyweight, worked.
Instructed by manager Descamps to
go fast and punch hard, Arnold did
his best. But Carpentier's head
bobbed so fast and he shifted that the
lad was unable to connect. After one
round Chris retired in favor of Journee
after attempting to find the challenger
with his left, let Arnold come in again.
The latter worked five rounds, but was
unable to connect. When it was over
he patted Georges on the back as if he
was the world's next champion.
This workout may have revealed
the secret of what Georges will do
when he meets Dempsey Saturday,
a defensive game and an attempt to
keep away from Dempsey's wallops
until he sees a chance to connect with his right.

Say Dempsey in Good Shape
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., June 25.
After a 24 hour lay-off to celebrate
his 26th birthday, Jack Dempsey swung
back into his training grind today,
working 45 minutes under a broiling
sun and before newspaper correspondents
and 1,500 other persons.
He perspired through the tens of
minutes of actual work, although he
only boxed six. He opened with a
three minute round of pulling the
weights and then followed a round of
shadow boxing. Eddie O'Hara, New
York middleweight, stepped the first
two rounds with Dempsey but it was
evident that the champion was pulling
his punches.
The champion frequently feinted the
fast moving O'Hara into openings,
but did not follow up his advantage
except two or three times. In the
second round he drove a couple of
heavy rights into O'Hara's body and
crossed him twice with a "one-two"
punch that shook the New Yorker.
He also drove him into a corner just
as the bell rang in the second and
crossed him with a vicious right to
the head. Larry Williams, who
faced Dempsey for the third and
fourth rounds, boxed almost too
cautiously to make the champion ex-
tend himself.
The title holder boxed the last two
rounds with Jack Renault. After
sparring the big Canadian heavyweight
around he wrestled for a round with
Bull Montana. He concluded with
some calisthenics.
Before the workout Dempsey chatted
for half an hour with the foreign
experts and boxing enthusiasts. They
also were impressed with his size and
strength. After watching him work
they agreed that he was well trained.

BODY OF MINER
FOUND IN HOLE

NEAR PRESCOTT

Republican A. P. Leased Wire

PRESCOTT, Ariz., June 25. The
body of a man which was found
wrapped in a sack in a shallow prospect
hole near the Palace station, 25
miles south of here in the Bradshaw
Mountains, was identified by Frank
Wilson of Mayer today as the body
of his uncle, Walter Steinbrooke. He
made the identification at a coroner's
inquest this afternoon. Steinbrooke
had been missing for more than three
months.
The body of George Freyda, an old
prospector, was found wrapped in a
similar manner at the back of a pros
pect tunnel on his property near the
place where Steinbrooke's body was
found.

The first round ended with Hutc
hinson leading by three strokes after
a bitter battle.
It was only in the second round
that Wethered began to fall behind
and after some troublesome holes
returned an 82 as against Hutchinson's 80.
Thus for the second time, the
championship has gone abroad, the
other foreign winner being Arnaud
Massy, French professional, in 1907.
A great crowd followed the players
and thirty thousand persons were
about the last green. Other spectators
were on roofs or were hanging out of
windows. . . .
At the close of the match Wethered
smilingly advanced and congratulated
Hutchinson, who was raised shoulder-
high and presented with the cham
pionship cup amid cheers. . .
Missed putts by Wethered and
wonderfully accurate pitches by
Hutchinson are briefly the story of
the American's victory. Many times
Hutchinson played mashie shots up
to one hundred yards, which flew
at a great pace toward the flag to
drop like a stone within a yard or
two of the hole.
When Hutchinson had victory
safely in his grasp, his game appeared
to slacken.

CHICAGO, June 25. With the
case of the 18 men indicted in
connection with the 1919 world's series
scandal but 85 hours away, the
prosecution tonight let it become
known that arrangements had been
completed for at least one defendant
to turn state's evidence and that
others alleged to have been "on the
inside," but not indicted, would testify.
From both prosecution and defense
came announcement that there would
be no further delay. Jurist Hugo Friend,
before whom the trial is scheduled
to start Monday, notified both sides
he would permit no unnecessary delay.
State officials, while refusing to
permit use of their names, did not
hesitate to outline the proposed
course of procedure.
"Our case is absolutely complete,"
one official said. "Our investigations
have uncovered every detail of the
conspiracy and we have more witnesses
than we need. Selection of a jury, I
think, will take more time than the
taking of testimony."
While 18 men are under indictment,
it is not believed more than 14 will
be present for trial. Carl Zork and
Ben Franklin of St. Louis, alleged by
the state to have been among "leaders
in the alleged conspiracy," will present
affidavits that illness prevents their
presence, according to their attorneys.
Hal Chase was released in California
some time ago after being arrested
and Abe Attell was discharged in
New York today.
Discharge of Attell in no way af
fects the state's case, officials said.
The eight Chicago White Sox
players indicted Eddie Cicotte, Buck
Weaver, Joe Jackson, Claude Williams,
Swede Risberg, Fred McMullin, Chick
Gandil and Happy Felsch all are
under bail. All but McMullin and
Cicotte are playing ball here with a
semi-professional team. Zork and
Franklin also are under bail. Ben and
Louis Levi and David Zeizer, alleged
gamblers, have given bail and are ex
pected to be present, but nothing is
known as to whether Rachel Brown
and Joseph J. Sullivan will appear.
Neither has been apprehended.
Bill Burns has not been apprehended,
but when he did not appear the
matter was pursued.

Veteran Leader Returned
To Office By Majority
Of Almost 2 to 1 Makes
Brief Statement

Republican A. P. Leased Wire

DENVER, Colo., June 25. Presi
dent Samuel Gompers, America's
veteran labor leader, overwhelmingly
defeated his first serious opposition
since 1894 today and was returned to
office with his entire administration
for another year by the American
Federation of Labor.
This sweeping victory, the labor
chief said tonight at the close of the
federation's forty-first annual con
vention, demonstrated that the
American trade union movement
will not submit to dictation from
the force of corruption or greed.
"Neither the Hearsts nor the Garys
can chart our course or select our
leaders."
Means Progressive Action
"Our movement is united. It is
prepared to be aggressive in defense
of the rights of the toilers. It will
not be swerved from its course. It
will be a sad day for the aspirations
of the working people of our land
when corrupt and intriguing interests
can either divide our movement,
change our course, or destroy its
leadership. The vote today has
demonstrated to the world that we
have not yet come upon that day.
"The whole work of the convention,
the resolutions and declarations
adopted, the policies indicated, mean
for the future a united progressive,
militant movement, following upon a
progressive, fruitful and militant
past.
"For myself, I may say that the
work of the convention and the result
of the election fill me with satisfaction,
gratitude and pride not for myself,
but for our movement. I am proud
of our movement and my life shall
be given to it in the future as it has
been for these many years.
"We are in serious times, but we
face them undaunted and with con
fidence and courage."
Gompers made a clean sweep from
the beginning when President Gom
pers was returned to the presidency
for the fortieth time by overwhelming
John L. Lewis, president of the United
Mine Workers of America, by a vote
of 12,324 to 5,022.
The vote was taken amid scenes of
wild enthusiasm, rivaling those of
national political conventions. The
galleries were packed with spectators.
The convention floor was overflowing
with delegates and their friends. Cheers
and applause swept the auditorium at
every vote.
Several attempts by the Gompers
supporters to stampede the delegates
for the veteran labor leader during
the demonstration failed, as scores
of delegates withheld their enthusiasm
and remained silently in their seats,
unmoved by the urgings of fellow
delegates.
This was the first time that
Gompers has been seriously opposed
since 1894, when he was defeated by
John McBride, a mine worker, at a
convention in this city, but he was
returned to office the following year.
When his victory was announced
the labor leader, who is now 71 years
old, could scarcely control his emo
tions and was on the verge of tears
when he took his place at the rostrum
to thank the delegates for their sup
port and confidence, declaring that
"my election will bring no comfort to
Gary or Hearst."
Lewis Supporters Few
Lewis, of the mine workers, arose
from his place at the rear of the hall
and declared in a stirring address that
he "accepted the verdict of the
American Federation of Labor with
out the slightest tinge of enmity in
my mind," adding:
"I have used no dishonorable
methods in my efforts to realize my
aspiration for the presidency.
"I have not been the candidate of
William Randolph Hearst. I do not
know the man.
"I stand more than ever before for
the great trade union movement of
America and my voice and ability shall
always be given to making the
American labor movement greater
than ever before."
He was given a tremendous ovation
as he concluded his speech.
The official roll call showed the
only five organizations voted solidly
for the mine workers' leader. They
were the United Brotherhood of Car
penters and Joiners, International
Association of Machinists, Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers, Tailors, and
the Draftsmen's Union.
The mine workers' delegation split
their vote. Frank Tarrington, presi
dent of the Illinois district; Robert
Harlan, president of Washington dis
trict; and Alexander Howat, presi
dent of the Kansas district, United
Mine Workers of America, cast in
their total votes of 1,596 for Gompers.
Lewis, who as a delegate held 358
votes, did not cast his ballot.
The railroad organizations, which
were reported to have backed the
Lewis boom, failed to support him.
Two of the largest unions, electrical
workers and railway carmen, voted
solidly for Gompers. The building
trades unions and a majority of the
metal-working organizations also
voted for Gompers.

WOULD SUPPRESS DANCE HALLS
AS SOCIETY SINKS

CENTRAL IOWA

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
DES MOINES, Ia., June 25. Sup
pression of dance halls as a menace
to the moral life of the nation and a
"united strike on moving pictures by
church people" was advocated by the
social service committee in its annual
report to the Northern Baptist conven
tion here today.
A far reaching program of social
reform, including national as well as
international relations, was outlined
by the committee.
Chief among the recommendations
provided that there be a continuance
of temperance education and an
amendment to the Volstead act to
make easy the enforcement of the
law; that there be a vigorous super
vision of the dance halls and moving
pictures, and, if necessary, the elim
ination of the dance halls; that the
social service work among the Baptist
churches be extended so amusement
features in the church may be included
to keep the young people from follow
ing the degenerate trend; that there
be a reduction of the crushing burden
of taxation included in the program
of armaments and the declaration of
a naval holiday between the United
States, Great Britain and Japan, and
that there be formal action by the
United States to limit the sale of liquor
by American citizens in China and
other non-Christian countries.
The following were chosen without
opposition to serve during the coming
term as members of the Northern
Baptist board of education:
Mrs. F. W. Ayer of Camden, N. J.;
Prof. E. D. Burton of Chicago; Rev.
J. R. Curry of Bozeman, Mont.; Prof.
E. Price of Chicago; Prof. Henry B.
Robins of Rochester, N. Y.; A. L.
Scott of Newton Center, Mass.; Rev.
H. F. Stillwell, Cleveland, O.; Rev.
Dr. F. M. Goodchild of New York
City, and C. R. Brock of Denver, Colo.
Messages of appreciation were sent
to President Harding, Secretary of
Labor Davis and Secretary of State
Hughes, thanking them for the fra
ternal greetings.

Believe Offer Of
Lloyd George Last
Effort For Peace
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, June 25. Pleasurable
surprise is expressed by the Sunday
morning newspapers at Premier
Lloyd George's invitation to Eamonn
de Valera and Sir James Craig to
engage in a conference with repre
sentatives of the government. It is
pointed out that this peace move is
the most liberal made thus far in
view of the fact that no conditions
are imposed for the meeting.
The Sunday Times refers to the
proposal as the "last offer the gov
ernment can make to the Sinn Fein,"
and adds:
It is a political potentiality that
Mr. de Valera may refuse to accept.
In that case the alternative of the
government is clear. The resources
of the British empire to enforce peace
are at hand.
The Sunday Observer says the
premier's letter is a counterpart and
an explanation of the cabinet's de
cision to increase the purely military
pressure on the Sinn Fein.
But, it adds, "full recourse to re
pressive measures will not be had
until or unless the Sinn Fein leaders
decline the offered conference."

Nevada Attorney General
Not Satisfied With Decision
Of District Judge In Dismissing
Action To Annul Divorce Decree
Granted Months ago
Republican A. P. Leased Wire

MINDEN, Nev., June 25. The state
supreme court is to be asked to pass
upon the divorce of Mary Pickford
and Owen Moore, which was sustain
ed today in a decision by District Judge
Frank C. Langan. Attorney General
Leonard H. Fowler announced he
would appeal and filed a list of ex
ceptions to Judge Langan's decision
preliminary to that action.
The action attacking the divorce
was brought by the attorney general
on the grounds that the laws cover
ing divorce had not been observed by
the principals.
In his decision Judge Langan held
that the laws did not confer authority
on the attorney general to institute
action for the setting aside of divorce
decrees. He ordered the service of
summons upon the interested parties
quashed and sustained the answer of
Miss Pickford's counsel to the at
torney general's complaint.
The court, and not the attorney
general, is the representative of so
ciety and the state in divorce cases,
the decision held, and the judgment
in the divorce action is the best evi
dence of the legality of that action
and cannot be contradicted. It con
tinued that the allegation of fraud
made by the attorney general cannot
be made the basis of depriving the
parties of the decree and that neither
state nor attorney general is aggrieved.
The findings of the court as to resi
dence, which were resisted by the
attorney general on the ground that
the residence in the state was insuf
ficient, are final and even if fraud has
been shown, the attorney general is
estopped from acting in the matter,
the decision said.
Summing up, the decision said the
complaint showed no cause of action
and that as the plaintiff was not an
aggrieved party no publication of sum
mons could be made legally and dis
missal of the complaint was the only
action that could be taken up.

This is one of the big scenes from the Clara Smith Hamon film story,
"Fate," now nearing completion in Los Angeles, in which the slayer of Jake
Hamon, oil magnate, replays her life role. Incidentally this is the first
picture to be sent out of Clara Hamon in the movies. It shows a portion
of the "struggle scene" shortly before the shooting. John Lice is shown in
the role of Hamon. The backers declare they are going through with the
production despite the fact that film men throughout the country declare
they would not show it.

HOOVER SUGGESTS DILUTION
OF PRIVATE CREDIT LINES OF
FOREIGN COUNTRIES

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, June 25. While
expressing disapproval of the Korr's
bill to create a $100,000,000 corporation
to aid farm exports, Secretary
Hoover today told a senate committee
that the administration recognized the
serious economic plight of American
farmers and was engaging in "mobiliz
ing private banking credits to prevent
the forced liquidation" of farm commo
dities, particularly of cotton and sugar.
"Let us first attempt," he said, "to
prevent forced liquidation of these
commodities by mobilizing private
capital, as has been done in the cattle
industry, and then if we fail, there
will be time enough to get the gov
ernment to take up the burden di
rectly."
Chairman Norris said there was ex
pressed belief that if pursuit of
Murgula and his band became too hot,
they will attempt to cross into the
United States.

F.I ad ance Curie Ends
Short Stay In U. S.,
FOR BUSINESS

Ninth-Six Per Cent Of
Depositors, the Bonding
Companies, Stockholders
And Officers In Agreement
That Brings Resumption

After a struggle of more than three
months, during which there has been
splendid co-operation between State
Auditor Fairfield on the one hand
and the officers and depositors and
stockholders of the Central Bank,
Phoenix, on the other, an arrange
ment was completed yesterday under
which the bank will be reopened on July 1.
The litigation which recently was
instituted by I. E. Accomazzo, one
of the depositors, to compel the State
auditor to report to the attorney gen
eral the condition of the panic, it is
believed will be dismissed, as Mr.
Accomazzo has stated that his purpose
was to expedite the movement for a
re-opening of the institution and not
to precipitate a receivership. It is
understood that the one change con
templated in the official list of the
bank will be the appointment of E.
C. Bradford, state bank examiner, to
be cashier. Mr. Bradford has not yet
been elected to the position and he
has not signified that he would accept it.
For this favorable outcome of the
bank's affairs the chief credit is even
to the zeal and firmness of Mr.
Fairfield.
Agree Upon Re-Opening
The plan of reorganization was fi
nally approved by the state superin
tendent of banks yesterday and the
officers of the bank were notified by
him that the bank may resume busi
ness as soon as it could arrange for
the re-opening.
His approval was based upon the
action of the nine bonding companies
interested in accepting and agreeing
to the plan of reorganization, following
the signing of the depositors' agreement
by 96 per cent of the depositors, and
by the acquiescence and co-operation
of the correspondent banks. The net
result of these is that the bank is found
to be solvent and is in safe condition
for resumption of business.
Following the notice by the superin
tendent of banks of his determination,
the officers of the bank fixed upon July 1
the date for the formal re-opening of the bank.
While an earlier date might have been
fixed, the clerical work of preparing
the certificate of deposit for delivery
under the depositors' agreements and
the other clerical work necessary made
it advisable to delay the formal re
opening a few days, and as the first of
the month is a convenient time, the
date was fixed as above stated.
Matter for Congratulations
While there has been delay in the
re-opening of the bank this has been
due to the fact that the work of adjust
ing the affairs of the bank under the
plan of reorganization necessarily re
quired time and labor. It is a matter,
however, of congratulation that suc
cess finally has been achieved and the
affairs of the bank put in such shape
as to receive the official approval of
the superintendent of banks and to
justify the confidence of all persons
concerned that the bank will open under
conditions which assure successful op
eration. Every friend of the bank feels
grateful for the disinterested and hearty
support given to the plan of reorganiza
tion by the community at large. The
sympathetic and helpful attitude assumed
by the other large banks has contributed
largely to the result. A generous sup
port was given by the three banks of
Los Angeles, El Paso, Kansas City and
New York, which have accounts with
the Central Bank, the nine bonding com
panies have accepted the reorganization
and the depositors have signed the
agreement.

MORE RECORDS FALL
ST. PAUL, Minn., June 25. Tommy
Milton of St. Louis, world's straight-
away and speedway driving champion,
today shattered several dirt track records
at a speed program arranged in his
honor by the Elks today. He drove a
mile in 47 1-4 seconds, shattering the
previous best record by a fifth of a
second; five miles in 3:33 3-4; 10 miles
in 7:14 1-2; 15 miles in 11:07 1-2. All
these figures are said to eclipse all pre
vious marks.

Two Kinds of Women
I know a woman, who when she needs
to purchase necessary things for the
home or the family puts on her shopping
costume, dabs a bit of powder on her nose
and sallies forth.
She shops one street here and up
there chases and chases and down
another hunting and hunting.
When she gets home she is lazy and
jaded. She feels all mussed up mentally
and physically.
We know another who has learned the art of reading
the advertisement before she starts out. She finds out
what she wants and where to get it. Then she goes
straight down town and right to the store that has it.
In this way she saves time, money and effort and comes
home fresh as a daisy and ready to get dinner for her
friend or husband a good dinner instead of taking him
to the cafeteria.
Which one are you?
