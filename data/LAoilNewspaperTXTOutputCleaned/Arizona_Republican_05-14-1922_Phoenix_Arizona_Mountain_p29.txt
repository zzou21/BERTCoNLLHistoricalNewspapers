CADILLAC WAS
BORN 1888
“Mother of the Automobile Industry," is a title which is applied to
the Cadillac Motor Car company by
veterans of the automobile industry.

The Cadillac Motor Car company
traces its origin back to 1899, for it
was the company organized in Detroit

realization of a wish which has never even been
encouraged into a definite hope, is the appear
ance of a new car with a Knight-type motor at $1375.
Few ever expected to see this amazing motor in
a worthy car at so low a price—The Willys-
Knight car —well bred, well made, well behaved,
gentle to its occupants. With Willys-Knight
Motor —the highest development of the Knight
sleeve-valve principle—quiet, dignified, proud,
untroubled, and, like a good friendship, improv

Out of the wealth of Packard experience has come, in this new Single-Six,
a mastery of production which has
now resulted in value little short of
revolutionary.
Packard has learned how to surpass
itself —and still widen immeasurably
the circle of Packard ownership.
For those who seek cars of the highest
caliber, the value plainly expressed in
these exquisite cars leaves literally no
choice but Packard.

While out of this veteran company
there have sprung a number of small

state, the average length of service
of foremen, assistant foremen and
superintendents—the real guides and
guardians of the precise manufacturing methods this company has come
to stand for—is approximately nine
years. A score of the employees have
served this company from 20 to 23
years.
It is declared by officials that the
long service of the workmen, who
have matured into the most skilled
craftsmen, is one of the main reasons
for the long-continued reputation
of Cadillac as a car of precise
workmanship and almost unlimited
dependability.

just received a description of this
speed wagon.
The “Sallies” will dispense from
this lunch room hot beverages and

Eventually it is hoped to make simi

FRANK ELLIOTT IS
CONTENDER FOR
THREE-THOUSANDS
Consistently placing in the money
in every race event of the year, Frank
Elliott, driver of the California made
Leach Special, is gathering plenty of
points and is one of the leaders thus
far for the 1922 A. A. A. championship. Elliott drove the same car last
year with great success and although
he was in several serious accidents
and smashups, both he and his mechanician came through without a
scratch.
Elliott’s latest notable performance
was at the recent Fresno Raisin Day
150-mile race, where he won second
money and 160 points towards the
year’s speed title. His Leach performed beautifully throughout and
showed plenty of speed.
The first success of the year was
on the Los Angeles speedway in
March, where Elliott picked up 80
points and considerable prize money,
despite having a few narrow escapes
from bad spills. Then in the sprint
race on April 5, he grabbed off the
fourth heat in good style at the fast
time of 114.6 miles per hour and
would have been a figure in the finals
but was in a nasty clash with Klein
and Bordino but managed to get his
car back in the grind and still fin
ished within the money. His next
appearance was in the San Carlos
race two weeks later, where despite a
broken kingbolt, he again managed to
annex championship points and prize
money.
The Leach is entered in all the big
race events of the year, with Elliott
at the wheel. Harry A. Miller, vice
president of the Leach company of
Los Angeles, is now building dupli
cates of Elliott's speed car for Tommy
Milton and Jimmie Murphy both cars
and motors are expected to be ready
for the Indianapolis grind.
BRITISH TO
PARTICIPATE IN
SPEEDWAY GRIND
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., May 13—
(Special)—The British colors will
precede the annual band parade be
fore the start of the tenth annual
500-mile race on the Indianapolis
motor speedway, Tuesday, May 30.
Although Louis Coatalen is expected
to make an eleventh hour entry of a
team of Sunbeams, from Wolver
hampton, Eng., it was not a certainty that there would be an English
competitor. Any doubt was dispelled
recently with the receipt by W. E.
Myers, secretary-manager of the In
dianapolis motor speedway, of a
cable from London, entering a Bent
ley car.
This will be the debut of the Bent
ley in American racing. The entry
is made by W. Douglas Hawkes, the
engineer and designer of the car, who
may drive the racer in the dash for
$100,000 on Memorial Day. Reports
from England imply that Hawkes will
make Jules Goux and his pair of
Ballot entries hurry to defend the
European honors in the international
classic.
Goux, one of the craftiest pilots
who ever came over to represent
France, has two new Ballot mounts,
but has not announced his team
mate. Last year in the French Grand
Prix, Goux took one of the small two
litre (122 cubic inch) Ballots and
drove it into third place. The car
did not have the speed of several it
defeated but Goux had the skill to
outgeneral his speedier competitors.
Goux was also the first foreigner to
win an Indianapolis race, taking the
1913 event with a Peugeot. Goux
has a warm spot in his heart for In
dianapolis, he was unsuccessful in
his last attempt to win the 1920 race,
but he did win a bride the same year
and Madame Goux is coming to visit
home folks while Monsieur Goux tries
to add to the family exchequer.
In addition to the French and Eng
lish flags, the Italian colors are ex
pected to vie with Old Glory in the
parade before the start and to be
hurled into the air by signal bombs.
Only Belgium or Germany will be
missing among all the countries
which have ever had cars in the 500-
mile classic,

OLDS STARTLES
NATIVES WITH
SPEED ABILITY
Better than a mile a minute for
1,000 consecutive miles. This is the
established record of the Oldsmobile
Twin Four made about six months
ago in San Francisco on the Cotati
speedway, under the official newspaper observation.
It is a record that is pointed to with
pride by the Snow and Tufts organiza
tion, Arizona state distributors, as
proof conclusive of the power, speed
and durability of the Twin Four and
a speed mark that will bring home
to the minds of the motoring public
the many merits of the Oldsmobile
Twin Four.
The actual time as recorded by the
stop watches was 1,000 miles in 899 minutes. The car
started on the record run at 1:05
Sunday morning and crossed the fin
ish line of the one thousandth mile
at 4:04 Sunday afternoon, piling up
the very pleasing average of 66 2-3
miles per hour.
“We are mighty proud of the per
formance of this car, as it shows so
very clearly that, due to its splendid
oiling and cooling systems, the Oldsmobile Twin Four is capable of sus
tained high speed with open throttle.’’ declares Manager Bob Coulter,
“We knew this Baby Eight was ca
pable of withstanding a lot of pun
ishment and have notified most all
of the owners of this model that once
they get their motor properly broken
in, they can step on the throttle just
as hard as they want to and that the
motor will stand all the punishment
you can possibly give it and really
like it.”
“There are many automobiles that
can travel one mile or five miles
at the rate of 66 2-3 miles per hour,
but, when you ask them to travel
1000 miles at such speeds as to net
66 2-3 miles per hour, that is an en
tirely different story and there are
mighty few cars that can do it. The
greatest part of the journey had to
be driven at 75 miles per hour, and
some of the laps were traveled at
the rate of 82 miles per hour.
“Not once in the thousand flying
miles did the motor falter or com
plain against the severe strain to
which it was constantly being sub
jected.
“It proved again and again during
the test that it has power, speed and
stamina, and that it is equal to any
thing that even the most critical
drivers could demand.”

WILLYS OVERLAND
TURNING OUT 10
MOTORCARS DAILY
Production of Overland and Wil
lys-Knight cars has now passed the
400 daily mark, according to H. H.
Hotchkiss, of the Overland-Arizona
company.
April production exceeded that of
any April since 1917 and even with
this large production orders con
tinue to exceed it.
The company is employing 8,000
workers. It is adding to the force
gradually and carries daily adver
tisements in the papers for skilled
mechanics of various kinds.
A statement of the company says
that “Willys-Overland orders con
tinue greatly in excess of production
in spite of the fact that shipments
exceeded those of any April since
1917.”
Without a dissenting vote pre
ferred stockholders of the Willys-
Overland, at a special meeting, rati
fied the proposal of the directors for
funding of Overland bank debt by a
$17,500,000 seven per cent bond issue.
The bonds will mature December 1,
1923.
The action of the preferred stock
holders constitutes one of the most
important steps in the placing of
Overland finances on a permanent,
sound basis.
The management will make no pre
dictions as to probable yearly pro
duction of the company, but it is
understood that if production during
the entire year is maintained on the
basis of the first quarter, the Overland will have enjoyed one of the
best years since the War.
Difficulty in getting raw materials
is holding back production to some
extent not only with the Overland
but with many other Toledo com
panies. This is especially true of
steel products. Operating on greatly
curtailed programs the steel com
panies were unprepared for the sud
den reopening of business on so
large a scale.

THE SIX RAN
16 MILES WITH
NO OIL IN CASE
Information has been received by
the Smith Motor Sales company,
Packard distributors, that a Packard
Single Six roadster ran over 16 miles
in Los Angeles the other day without
a drop of oil in the crankcase.
Exploding volumes of contention
by lubrication experts that a motor
car must have oil and lots of it to
run, the car driven by Earl A. Garrettson, traveled 16.4 miles through
the business and residential thoroughfares of Los Angeles with the
crankcase of the motor as devoid of
oil as a billiard ball.
And equally strange in the prece
dent wrecking trip was the fact that

the motor bearings did not seize nor
did the engine heat; in fact, imme
diately at the close finish of the run
that consumed one hour and 50 min
utes of continuous operation of the
motor, the observers placed their
hands on the power plant. Further
more the motometer registered cool
motor, which is considerably below
the summer average level at which
engines attain the highest efficiency.
The feat, which was declared on all
sides to be impossible, was planned
by Earl A. Garrettson to prove the
lasting lubricating qualities of Oildag, for which he is Pacific coast
distributor. The trip of 16.4 miles
was completed without a semblance
of difficulty and proved Mr. Garrett
son’s claims that Oildag adheres to
the cylinder walls so completely that
scored cylinders and burned bearings
are next to impossible.
Throughout the run the Packard
battled with traffic, which is best
shown by the fact that it required 1
hour and 50 minutes to complete 16.4
miles, during which time the engine
never stopped for an instant. Eigh
teen stops were necessary because of
congestion at street intersections in
the course of the run; and the av
erage speed outside the congested
zone was about 20 miles an hour. As
high as 35 miles an hour was regis
tered, showing that after slow speed
and stop-and-go work downtown, the Oildag
remaining on the cylinder walls after the oil had been drained before the
start was functioning perfectly.
Veterans in the automotive indus
try who witnessed the test were dum
bfounded by the performance of the
car.

J.W. HAWK IS NEW
SALES MANAGER OF
MICHIGAN DURANT
NEW YORK, May 13.—(Special).—
The appointment of J. W. Hawk as
sales manager for Durant Motor
company of Michigan, is announced
today by M. B. Leahy, general sales
manager for all the Durant plants.
Mr. Hawk has gone to Lansing to
assume his new duties. He succeeds
Leon R. German, who tendered his
resignation recently, and who plans
to enter business himself.
Mr. Hawk has been identified with
the motor car industry since 1909.
Originally with Overland, he later
joined the Chalmers sales staff, and
since 1915 has been connected with
the sales department of the Chevrolet Motor company as zone sales
manager in Texas and other sections
of the country, and more recently as
special representative of the sales
department of Chevrolet, with head
quarters in Detroit, a position which
he leaves to join the Durant staff.
o
Fierce Clutch
The car owner should remember
that when the clutch is fierce in tak
ing hold and does not have a slight
slip, the mechanism that transmits
the power from the engine to the
drive wheels, particularly as regards
pinions, universals and gear teeth,
receives destructive strains.
When Brakes Are Dangerous
In descending long, steep hills, if
the brakes are applied so that the
wheels cannot turn, the car is apt
to skid in a most precarious man
ner. Under such conditions tire
chains with cross chains on every
link and a transmission brake form
the best method of descent.

♦
Why Take the Short End?—
In any tire you buy the rubber
, tread represents only 30% of
your investment.
When the tread is gone, the
fabric or cord carcass becomes
practically worthless—and you
have fully “cashed in” on only
the short end of your investment.
Building the tread wider and
thicker gives it more rubber to
wear and protect the fabric.
That’s why Gates Super-Tread
Tires are giving you the long end
