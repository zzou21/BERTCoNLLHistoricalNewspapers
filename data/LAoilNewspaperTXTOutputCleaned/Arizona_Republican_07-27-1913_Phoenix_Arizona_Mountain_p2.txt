Phoenix Team Makes Out

deemable With One Good
Game at New Park With
Maroons This Afternoon

i i
! PETE DALY WORKING
HIS HEAD OFF I

The new captain, Ritchie, laid
a cheque on the desk of the sport
editor. It was drawn in the sum
of $5000 to the credit of The
Arizona Republican, "for services
rendered baseball in the Salt
River valley." The endorsements
on the other side were as fol
lows :
( Spiller )
P. Kelly and Barngrover.
1b. Franz.
2b. Ferguson.
3b. Barclay.
ss. Ritchie.
lf. Bagley.
cf. Lewis,
rf. Clow.
Subs. Kearns. Yates.

The sport editor will not attempt
to cash that cheque. But it was a
clever way of announcing the line
up for this AFTERNOON'S game
against the Maroons in the new
park. "Afternoon's" is in caps be
cause the gentle typo made the pa
per say yesterday that the game was
to have happened in the morning,
which is untrue, or at least, unre
liable. About six hours so.
Ritchie says:
"I am going to take the Phoenix
lemons into the field this afternoon
to see what they can do."
Ritchie has said little more than
just that. But he has put that team
through a most awful series of ses
sions at the park. If gallons of sweat,
hundreds of degrees of heat, a dash
of cuss words, mountains of work
and a flock of good advice can make
a winning team out of nine ordinary
players, the Regulars are made.
Either Von Tyne or George Byers
will umpire this afternoon. The
Maroons will be glad.

And Here's Why
Refugio Gomez: "I wanta tell you,
the umpire is no good. He's give
us bad deal. Sunday, he put Cholo
on third base, when he oughta gotten
home. He called home run by the
third base foul ball, and take
three runs from the Maroons. I
no like him. The boys not like him, too. I told you, we gotta just
lick these umpires all time."
Mr. Gomez was referring in his not
to be imitated way to the Mesa
Maroon game Thursday, a contest
that ended two to one for Mesa
after the umpire had awarded Resvoloso third on an interfered hit. The
game will probably be protested be
fore the league at the Tuesday meet
ing. Manager Venne will also bring
out the fact that the umpire Thurs
day was not one of the officials elect
ed by the league.

Pete Daly the local welterweight
who meets George Memsic before
the Phoenix Athletic Club on the
night of the first of August is
working out for his bout as
though his life depended upon
making the best of condition. He
acquired a new sparring partner
to add to his already long list
yesterday one Dan Matthews,
well known to the Phoenix fight
fans who saw him box Phil
Brock and Jack McMahon here.
Dan is giving the husky the
workout of his life over the fire
house each day. The Monday
workout at 5:30 is open to all
and all are invited. Pete is also
putting in some good licks at
road work.

TEMPE AND MESA TO
FIGHT FOR LEADERSHIP

One of These Two Teams Will
Emerge as Top of League
Today.
TEMPE. July 26. With Roseola
Tweed working on the slap for the
locals big things are expected of the
Tempe nine by its home rooters in
the game against Mesa to be played
at the local park tomorrow afternoon.
With the Kansas twirler's arm once
more in usable shape after a lengthy
rest, caused by a sprain gained
shortly after his arrival in Tempe,
Tweed is being looked upon as
Tempe's white hope today.
That he will win with the accustomed
support given a Tempe pitcher
is vouched for by all the local fans,
still there is a sort of feeling that
Mesa has got something under her
hat that means the locals will not
score an easy victory.
With the possibility that Hudson
will be out of the game this afternoon
things are beginning to get interest
ing. Just who will fill the vacant
place on the Tempe nine is not given
out yet. Nutt will work behind the
bat today with the infield composed
of Griffen, Moeur and Spikes, second
base excepted, and Mullen, Harris
and Oviedo in the gardens. Interest
over the contest and who will be
the first to head the newly organ
ized Salt River Valley league, is con
stantly on the increase with Tempe
fans, especially after a month with
out a ball game on the home dia
mond. The contest starts promptly
at three-thirty o'clock.

BARNSTORMERS OF THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
N. B. The great yard dog that
made so much noise on Thursday
night, during the last act of "King
Richard the Third," will be sent to
a neighbor's over the way, and on
account of the prodigious demand for
places, part of the stable will be laid
into the boxes on one side and the
granary be open for the same purpose
on the other. Playbill, 1758, Quoted in
Sampson's History of Advertising.

Just to stimulate a little extra in
terest in the local baseball situation
and to show the players that the
business men of Phoenix are with
them in their efforts to put base
ball on the map, the REPUBLICAN
originated prepared and herewith

presents an entire page of Base Ball
Prize Announcements. Judging from
the reception the proposition met, 99
out of every 100 business men are
base-ball fans and the two Phoenix
teams need never fear lack of support.

$400.00 worth of prizes for each
game is a nice little collective purse
and undoubtedly will make the boys
tear loose just a little bit harder
and try to put over a few more Ty
Cobb stunts than usual. Judging
from the prizes offered what most
folks like to see is base stealing and
heavy hitting.
The only man who objected was
John Hyder of the Store de Luxe.
You see, John has been giving away
a fine hat for the first "over-the-fence"
hit at the Sunday games, and
so he feels that he should be allow
ed the exclusive privilege of giving
prizes to the ball-players. However,
John is really of a generous nature
and so is mighty glad to see the
long list of prizes hung up for the
boys, even if he can't give them all
himself.

Here is a swell chance for some
tosser to catch the eye of McGraw
or Connie Mack. The winning pitch
ers are to be "mugged" by Turnbull,
the local photographer, and the Harry
Robertson of the Phoenix Engraving
Company will make a dandy halftone, in his usual classy style, a
map which will be printed in the
paper that always prints the base-ball
news first. Some advertising for the pitcher.

If some of the men are fortunate
enough to win a couple of prizes,
some nifty combinations can be
worked out. For instance, "a drink
a day for a week" is offered by the
Central Pharmacy to the player who
steals the most bases, for Wayland says, "I sure admire a good slide."
Now if this same player also happens
to be the first to steal home, then
all he has to do is to present his
order to Eddie Doyle and walk off
with four bits worth of smokes. And
then there is Dave Goldberg who says
that "base stealing is the perfection
of the ball-player's art" and so Gold
berg's also hung up a prize of a
silk tie for the gentleman most ac
complished in the gentle art of piratieism. Dave is one of the men
that first made base-ball a go in
Phoenix and some there be who say
that his old team, "The Browns"
was the swiftest lot of players ever
seen together here.

Opposite views of the same ques
tion are taken in one case, for McKean's Dye Works has put a prize
for the player whose uniform is the
dirtiest at the end of the game, while
the REPUBLICAN is offering a six
months subscription to the man who
starts with the cleanest, neatest outfit.

"If you don't know Vic Hanny, you
ought to." When the adman asked
Vic what he'd put up to help out the
ball-team he said, "Help 'em, sure,
why I'll give a $25 suit of clothes
and a trunk to the player on the
visiting team that makes the most
bone-head stunts, I guess that would
be helping Phoenix some." Vic fin
ally tamed down and put up a nice
little prize for the player making the
most base hits.

Berryhill's very proud and justly
so, of being Spalding headquarters,
offers a Spalding League Ball, while
the other extreme is represented by
the Valley Hardware Supply Com
pany with a neat little take-off
that the fans will sure appreciate.

Massie can always be counted on
to be different, being a relative of
Mrs. Malone, and his offer is the
straight stuff, while another cracker
jack is that of George Hageman, who
when he heard of the proposition went right up in the air and when
he landed on his elliptical springs he
put up a prize that is in a class by
itself, same as is the FRANKLIN.
Real money is offered by the Phoe
nix Savings Bank and Trust Com
pany "The Bank for Savings," and
Mr. Foster says that all big league
players have Savings Accounts. So
here is a chance for some ball-player
to get in that class in one respect
at least.
A safety razor is the prize offered
by the OWL DRUG CO., for and he
likes to see the ball-players faces
when he goes to a game. Miller has
congenial company in this regard for
a similar weapon was also put up by
the ADAMS PHARMACY. Hard on
the barbers. And then to help this
along McBEAN OF BOEHMERS, the
busy Drug Store, paused in his rush
for the cash register long enough to
say, "Put us down for that William's
Stick, everybody's stuck on that."

Baseball is mighty serious matter
with Pinney and Robinson and they
wouldn't put a limit on the number
of prizes they offered. Draper and
Maynard Shoes and "bats no limit."
"We hope there are about eight
home runs each game," said they.

Three shoe shines by Jesse, the
only shines a Phoenix player ever
gets, and a bunch of smoking tobac
co put up by the Mary Ann Grocery
are two other prizes. It is hoped the
same man doesn't cop all the weed.
Jesse says he hopes to get some of the
light-footed players that Hageman is
talking about.

Reeves says, "Him that takes gets"
and "like unto like," so his prize is
the most suitable, everything con
sidered in the list Sunday he'll en
tertain the whole team at the Col
iseum or Empress.

Lyle Abbott, the studious and au
thoritative Sporting Editor of the
Republican, is to be official scorer
and awarder of prizes and will award
all certificates immediately after the
winning of the same. He has full
power and authority to settle all dis
putes, draws, ties, etc. Players be
sure to get their Premium Certifi
cates at the game.

Just so the fortunate player will not
be all "bust" with pride, the New York
Store is offering a leather belt as a
prize, and Elwell's grocery company,
just to give the winner his choice, says
so much merchandise from us.

AMERICAN LEADS
IN WORLD TENNIS

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
WIMBLEDON, July 26. The result
of today's victory by Maurice E.
McLoughlin of San Francisco and Har
old H. Hackett of New York over
H. R. Bassett and C. P. Dixon in the
doubles match is that the United
States team leads by two matches to
one in the struggle for the Dwight F.
Davis lawn tennis trophy, and requires
only one more victory in the two re
maining singles matches to carry off
the cup. The match went its fullest
extent, five sets of which the Ameri
cans took three and their opponents
two.
The score: 5-7, 6-1, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.
The English defenders, who began
to play tennis together when Mc
Loughlin was still in knickerbockers,
tried all the wiles of which they are
the masters, but without avail. Mc
Loughlin had recovered his form, and
lost only one of his service games.
Once Hackett played a game which
his opponents liked by feeding them
two volleys at the net, where the
English veterans formed an absolute
stone wall. They made every possi
ble return to Hackett, recognizing in
him the weak link in the American
defense.
Although often tempted, McLough
lin did not poach on his partner's
preserves, often heroically allowing
him to take overhead balls which he
himself loves to smash. Toward the
end of the match Hackett became
more sure of his volleys and lobs,
which had been falling short before.
McLoughlin smashed his racquet in
the fourth set and the Britons were
within a point of winning the set and
the match, but the Californian never
faltered and pulled his own service
out of the fire.
If the draw adhered to for the
singles be played on Monday, Mc
Loughlin will face Charles P. Dixon,
who was defeated by Williams in
Friday's match, while the young Har
vard player will be sent against John
C. Parke, who took the Californian's
measure on Friday.
