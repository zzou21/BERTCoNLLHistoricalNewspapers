EASY GLASSES
FOR UNEASY EYES
Are your eyes uneasy?
Are they beginning to rebel?
Are they pleading for help?
Sometimes with tears, other times
with pain of eyeball or that ever re
curring and persistent headache.
BE GOOD TO YOUR EYES.
They are your faithful servants.
They bring the beauties of nature to
you. Help them to serve you. Give
them proper windows to look through.
You may be sure of proper attention
when you come to us.

PERFECT
SODA WATER
Daintiness marks the making
and serving of our soda water;
satisfaction and refreshment fol
lows the drinking. Fairly good
soda is not hard to find, but ab
solutely perfect soda is a rarity.
We serve perfect soda because
we have the fountain; the exper
ience, the skill, and do not hesi
tate to spend money to make our
soda best. We look after the
cleanliness as carefully as though
we had to do all the drinking our
selves. To drink our soda is to
go out glad.

SCHOOL BUILDING REPAIRS
Masterers and decorators have been
at work the past week making the
necessary repairs in the school build
ings of the city preparatory to the
opening of school in the fall. At the
Central school, the oldest of the
buildings, some $500 has been ex
pended. A MOUNTAIN EXCURSION To-
morrow, a party composed of Vernon
Cook, Frank Hildebrand, Stratton
Copeland and Morris Cook will leave,
overland, for the Sierra Anchas moun
tains, where they will spend a month
hunting big game and enjoying the
pleasant fishing said to be afforded by
the hill streams of that district.
IRRIGATIONISTS' OUTING To
morrow. Louis Hill will arrive from
Roosevelt and join Mr. and Mrs. U. A.
Fowler, all three leaving for Los An
geles tomorrow evening. At Los An
geles Mrs. Hill will join the party and
the trip on to Portland will be made.
There the gentlemen will attend the
meeting of the National Irrigation
congress and the ladies will visit the
fair.
REMOVAL OF A LANDMARK
The first of the coming week work will
be begun tearing down the brick
building at the foot of Seventh street
formerly used by the M. & P. road as
a depot. The building will be entirely
demolished and the ground where it
now stands will later be used as the
location of a switch to be used for un
loading purposes. Some of the brick
taken from the walls will be shipped to
Tempe and there used in the construc
tion of the new mission style depot,
plans for which were received at the
Phoenix office this morning.
THESE PEACHES ARE SOME
Much rivalry has been going on the
past five weeks among ranchers of the
south side over fruit specimens they
have sent to the board of trade for
display purposes. Several most elegant
samples have been received and placed
on exhibition by Mr. Van der Veer, the
secretary of the board. Today there
was received from Burt Wingar of
Mesa a sample of peaches of the Sel
lers Creng variety, fifteen of which
weighed 8 1/2 pounds. While it is hard
to judge which lot of the various spec
imens received would win the first
prize, it may be some consolation to
the fruit growers to know that every
man has so far won the praise in his
particular variety of fruit.
NEW CORPORATIONS Articles of
the following corporations were filed
in the office of the county recorder
yesterday: Shoshone Mines Securities
company, capital stock $100,000. In

ACCUMULATIONS OF THE SAB
BATH Yesterday was a busy day in
both of the justices' courts. Joe Gla
due, of whom little has been heard for
some time, was before Justice Bur
nett on a charge of a disturbance of
the peace. He paid $7. It turned out
that most of the defendants were
moneyed gentlemen. A. Martinez and
R. Chavez, found guilty of peace dis
turbances, each had seven dollars for
the enrichment of the county treasury.
Y. Mora and F. Alvarez each turned in
$8. A. Montoya got seven days in jail.
A more impecunious class appealed
before Justice Johnstone. Antonio Rosas,
Pedro Williams, Guadalupe Florez were
each sent to the county jail for seven
days. Jose Sotello and Juan Bravo
paid in $5. and Louis Peralta contrib
uted $7 to the school fund.
JUST OUT.

People throughout the territory are
beginning to realize that there is a
home manufacturing plant where they
can buy their harness or have them
made almost while they wait where
the proprietors take pains to get the
correct idea as to what the customers
want made either in harness, saddles,
bridles, shaps or tapaderos. Where
they give goods well worth the money,
do repairing neatly and well, buy their
leather from one of the best tanner
ies on the coast, carry a fine, well
selected line of silver-inlaid bits and
spurs, and also or collars, sell whips
from 10c up, thereby building up a
good healthy trade.
