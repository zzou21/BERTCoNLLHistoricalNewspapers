THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN; SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 17, 1898

SOCIETY

I shall be pardoned, I am sure, if I
tell you something of the dress that
created the greatest sensation on
Easter day. It was of quartz ladies'
cloth, a pretty blue steel color. The
fastenings and small metallic trim-
mings were of cut steel, and at the
throat there was a very large ruche of
quartz chiffon.
They say that the only woman whose
coat ever flies open is the one who
wears a coat lined with bright satin.
This one was lined with brilliant
parme taffeta which was put on to the
very edge of the collar so as to show the
hue. Mrs. Woodruff, Mrs. J. U. Early, Mrs.
Will C. Barnes, Mrs. Ancil Martin,

fashionable at the same time. recovery after a week's severe illness.
If you are interested in the colors Fossil is a deep grey; quartz is a steel grey; sultan yellow is a brilliant orange, and callan red is the gorgeous sunset note.
The purples range from daffodil,
which is a yellowish purple, to laven
der, parme, new purple which is deep
and rich. Castor is a leaf grey and the
new green is walnut shell green.
On many of the spring designs this
year there is much simple, but very ar
tistic decoration. Sometimes it is satin
in straps and at others fine braid,
sometimes a touch of exquisite passe
menterie and at others the strong con
trast of widely different materials. In
the cutting there are few radical de
partures from the lines in vogue last
year. The plaits fit a little closer,
and now and then an attempt is made
to show the handsomer lines of the
wearer's figure.
One of these attractive suits is made
of Vicuna cloth with medium finish
and of rather finer texture than usual.
The skirt falls smoothly in front,
forms two folds on each side and three
folds in the back. The waist is a mod
ified blouse, with but little pouching.
It has a novel rolling front and a high
stand-up collar. The sleeves are neat,
following the arm from the waist al
most to the shoulder, where they are
lightly puffed and stiffened on the up
per side. The lining is of taffeta silk
in Roman stripe or fancy mixture.
The collar, front, folds and sleeves of
the blouse and the front and sides of
the skirt are handsomely embroidered
in silk braid. The suit is bound to
wear well, vicuna cloth being almost
equal to broadcloth in its strength,
durability and other excellent qualities.
Vicuna cloth is one of the neatest and
comeliest of woolens, and its attract
iveness is but little changed by wear,
rain or rough usage.
The Easter services at the Phoenix
churches were thoroughly enjoyed.
The display of flowers was unusually
rich, and the music was of a very high
order. At the Presbyterian church
Miss Sargent sang "Easter Bells," with
violin accompaniment by Mr. Feuerstein,
in her most effective style. The
selections by the choir were exceedingly
happy. At the Episcopal church the
large congregation was delighted with
Messinger. Miss Cora Brill sang a solo
at vespers at the Catholic church.
The Philharmonic society will give
a concert for the benefit of the pro
posed library sometime in May.
The recital given by Miss Margaret
Randal at the M. E. church Tuesday
evening attracted a large and fashion
able audience. The program was a
varied and most attractive one. Miss
Randal is an artist in her profession
and her selections were well calcu
lated to show the wide range of her
talent. Miss Randal was assisted by
Mr. Andrews and Miss McKinney. Mr.
Andrews' rendering of the "Armorer's
Song" from Robin Hood was particu
larly pleasing. Miss McKinney sang a
sparkling ballad entitled "Almond
Blossoms," which was enthusiastically
received. The violin solo by Mr. Halsey
was especially good. Last on the
program, but by no means least, were
the "Scarf Fantastics" participated in
by Miss Plank, Miss Graham,
Miss Halsey, Miss Addine Bury,
Miss Sherritt, Miss Nutter, Miss
McKinney, Misses Tweed and Miss
Smith. The graceful postures and
charmingly simple costumes of the
young ladies were a source of artistic
satisfaction to the audience. The in
tricate tableaux, executed with admir
able ease and skill, were particularly
effective.
On Wednesday Mrs. Clinton Miller
entertained a few friends at a luncheon.
Mrs. E. M. Depew gave a baby party
on Monday afternoon. Light refresh
ments were served and the babies, to
judge by appearances, enjoyed them
selves immensely. Those present were
Walker Burtis, Francis Devereux, Har
old Turney, Harold Depew, Roswell
Walters, Dorothy Heighton, Etta Nor
ton, Harold Davidson.
The Daughters of Rebekah gave
a supper on Wednesday evening at
Masonic hall in honor of the visiting
Odd Fellows.
On Friday afternoon a delightful
card party was given by Mrs. E. R.
Holbrook. Her charming apartments
were tastefully decorated with roses,
and delicious refreshments were
served. Those present were: Mrs.
William Coon, Mrs. Joseph Kibbey,
Mrs. William Pinney, Mrs. Swetnam,
Mrs. J. B. Alexander, Mrs. J. W.
Evans, Mrs. Clay Leonard, Mrs. Frank
Covert, Mrs. Frank Smith, Mrs. Wylie,

The many friends of Mr. James Grif-

Delicious fruit punch and cake were served.
