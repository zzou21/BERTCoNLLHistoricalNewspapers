BROWN CURRY MEETING
TO OPEN JANUARY 10.
Revival Postponed Owing to Delay in
Finishing Southern California
Meeting of Similar Nature.
A big streamer was strung across
the street from the Southern Methodist
Church to the post office yesterday,
announcing the Brown Curry meeting
to begin on January the tenth, one
week from last night, and not on
Sunday night as had been previously
planned. This caused considerable
comment among those who had been
counting on attending the meeting and
some fear was expressed that the
distinguished revivalists would not be
able to reach Phoenix at all. This fear
was, however, allayed when it became
generally known the postponement was
made at the request of Reverend John
K. Brown, who stated by wire the
Southern California engagement had
been unexpectedly extended one week.
All of this made the arrival of Brown
and Curry at their home in Arkansas
much later than they had anticipated
so it became necessary to postpone
the Phoenix revival five days. In doing
this, while it delays the opening of
the services somewhat, no feeling was
engendered against Brown and Curry
because they had shortened their own
vacation one full week so as to be in
Phoenix even by the tenth.
The publicity committee is now at
work arranging to bill the town and
place additional streamers on prominent
corners. A number of attractive
photo cards of the two men have ar
rived and will be placed at points of
vantage during the next few days.

BY ESPEE ATTORNEYS

Say Oil Land Grant Case Is Most
Unprecedented.
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. Criticism
of the course of Attorney General
Wickersham in the Southern Pacific
Oil Land litigation was made by Maxwell
Evarts and Henry V. Clark,
counsel for the Southern Pacific Railroad
company, in
a brief filed today
in the supreme court
of the United
States in defense
of a claim involv-
ing millions in western oil lands. It
is said that the title of Southern Pacific
oil lands depends on the outcome of
the litigation.
The case now before the supreme
court involves the question whether
Edmund Burke and other private litigants
have better claims on the land
than the railroad company. The government
recently filed a suit seeking
to annul the patents on the land issued
to the Southern Pacific.
"It is unparalleled in the whole
history of judicial procedure," elo-
quences the railroad's attorneys, "for
the attorney general of the United
States to be permitted to intervene
as a 'friend of the court' in a case
between private litigants, and then
to use the privilege granted him as
to attempt to have decided issues not
now before the court, which may or
may not ever come before it in
the government suit just begun
against one of the parties in the case
now at the bar.
"It is certainly unjust and unfair
that a railroad be compelled in this
court of last resort, not only to defend
the present case, but also to defend another
case arising from different facts, which
has not proceeded beyond the filing of a
bill of complaint. Especially is this so when
the great seriousness and the vast
importance of this matter not only to
the Southern Pacific railroad but to
all land grant railroads is considered."

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3. Mrs. Rita
Di Rovey, wife of Frank Di Rovey, a
retired Italian army officer, was shot
and killed at her home here tonight by
M. J. Howley, of Scranton, Pa. Howley
then committed suicide.
A letter was found in Howley's pocket,
addressed to his mother in Scranton,
which upbraided her for her refusal
to give him money, intimated his
intention of taking his life and supplied
only a conjecture as to the motive of
the crime. Friends of Mrs. Di Rovey
said she sent Howley away from the
lodging house, where she boarded a
week ago, and had quarrelled with him
after he made an unsuccessful attempt
to borrow money from her.

sitting as a court of impeachment in
the trial of Judge Robert W. Archibald,
of the commerce court, will convene
again tomorrow after a lapse of more
than two weeks. The trial was scheduled
to resume today, but the death of

cluded a session today. A. S. Vorn-

THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY 4, 1913.

SANTA FE DOES
Superintendent H. C. Storey
Announces in Central and Eastern Arizona
Were Never Hotter Than
Kirkland Now
That conditions in Central and
Western Arizona were never better
and that the prospects for continued
and increasing business activity in
those sections of the state were never
brighter, is the statement of H. C.
Storey, superintendent of the
Santa Fe, Prescott-Phoenix railroad. With
the smelters running full blast at
Swansea and Humboldt, with heavy
shipments of ore being made daily,
with the construction of a new town at
Clarkdale and the development of mining
properties at Skull Valley, Parker and a
dozen other districts, a condition of activity
almost unprecedented in recent years
obtains.
With interests that are to a large
extent mutual in this because of the
necessity for an interchange of fluxing
ores the activity of one district
depends largely upon the activity of
the other, the Swansea and Humboldt
smelters are affording employment to
hundreds of mine and mill men. With
good wages being paid and employment
easily obtained the families of
these workmen are better situated
financially than they have been for
some months and the business houses
in the sections where these smelters
and mines are located are doing a
better business than
ever before in
their history.
The section through
which the Santa
Fe lines under Mr.
Storey's supervision, which is just
the greater part of
that in the Skull Valley region. From
that section there is now being sent
out of the railroad by trams, large
quantities of high grade ore, which
is being shipped down to the Phelps-
Dodge smelters at Douglas. It is believed
that it will not be long before a
railroad will be constructed
over to the mines in Skull Valley and
thereby eliminate the tedious work
of sending the ore out by trams and
teams.
Since the Verde valley extension
was completed in October many car
loads of structural material have been
shipped into the town now building
and already named Clarkdale in
honor of Senator W. A. Clark, who
owns the mines and who is causing
to be erected what will one day be
one of the largest smelters in Arizona
if not in the United States.
In the point of freight the Santa
Fe in Arizona has carried more merchandise
in than in any previous
year in its history. Locally, according
to Mr. Storey, the freight handling
facilities have been doubled
twice in the year and they are still
inadequate. In Prescott there has
been a remarkable increase in freight
business and this is true too of practically
all the smaller stations.
According to Mr. Storey the Santa
Fe has under contemplation just now
considerable improvement and extension
work, but the exact nature of
this he said he was not prepared to
disclose at this time.

FEDERATION MEETING
OF WOMEN POSTPONED
In Order to Assure Presence of National
President of Women's
Clubs.
The State federation of Women's
Clubs meeting which is to be held
in Douglas has been postponed from
the original date and will now convene
for January 27, 28 and 29
next, the change having been made
in order to insure the attendance
of Mrs. Percy V. Pennybacker of
Texas, the president of the national
federation who had promised to be
on hand.
As soon as the information was
conveyed to Dr. Agnes McKee Wallace
the state president, arrangements
were immediately made to postpone
the state federation meeting. In the
meeting the additional week's time
thus afforded gave opportunity to arrange
also for other features for the
club meet.
The women of Arizona are congratulating
themselves on the coming of Mrs.
Pennybacker, for she
is in addition to being one of the
most prominent members of the Women's
Club movement in the world, also
one of the woman historians of
the United States. Mrs. Pennybacker
is the author of a history of Texas
that has general circulation and is a
textbook in the Texas schools.
