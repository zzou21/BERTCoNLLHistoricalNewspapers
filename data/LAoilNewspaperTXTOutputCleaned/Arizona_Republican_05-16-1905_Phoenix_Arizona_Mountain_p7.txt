if you are wise.

in my family and find it a most excellent medicine. Its effects upon my

EXPOSURE.
To cold draughts of air, to keen and

perature, scanty clothing, undue ex
posure of the throat and neck after
public speaking and singing, bring on
coughs and colds. Ballard's Hore
hound Syrup is the best cure.
Mrs. A. Barr. Houston, Texas,
writes, January 31, 1902: "One bottle
of Ballard's Horehound Syrup cured
me of a very bad cough. It is very
pleasant to take." 25c, 50c, $1.00. Sold

A POSITIVE NECESSITY.

of Ballard's Snow Liniment. I can
cheerfully recommend it as the best
medicine for bruises ever sent to the
afflicted. It has now become a posi
tive necessity upon myself. D. R.

FINED SIXTY DOLLARS.
Miguel Montijo was brought before
Justice Neilson yesterday on a charge
of misdemeanor which consisted of in
decent exposure and the use of unbe
coming language on the street Sunday afternoon.
His language at one time became so
offensive to several gentlemen who
were standing on the street, that one
of them knocked him down and uncon
scious for several minutes. This gen
tleman was also arrested but in the
hearing yesterday morning, the justice
decided that the blow was excusable
under the circumstances, and the de
fendant was dismissed. Not so with
Montijo, however. His case was more
serious, and after a due consideration
of it, the justice fined him $60, or as
many days. Not having the cash he
took the other alternative, and will
spend two months in Phoenix at the
expense of the county.
PERSONAL, OTHERWISE.
M. E. Conboy, representing the Wes
tern Wholesale Drug company, was a
visitor here yesterday. He makes reg
ular trips through this part of the
country, and on this one he was ac
companied by the president of the
company, who expressed himself as be
ing well pleased with as much of the
valley as he had seen so far.
Chas. P. Richmond, of Phoenix, is
the guest of H. B. Griffen, of this

A GRAY WOLF SKIN.
Mr. and Mrs. A. M. Harmer received
a valuable and unique present a day or
two since from V. V. Perkins, a large
sheep owner in the northern part of
the territory. It was a gray wolf hide
which Mr. Perkins had killed himself.
He sent the pelt to Denver where it
was tanned nicely and it makes a
beautiful rug. It is exceptionally large,
measuring over five feet from tip to
tip.
PUBLIC SCHOOL COMMENCEMENT.
The annual commencement exercises
of the Tempe school will occur on next
Friday evening. The evening before
the lower grades of the school will
give an entertainment and Friday ev
ening will be devoted to the graduates
alone. The class this year will be a
large one, and an unusual feature re
garding it will be the number of boys
in the class. Ordinarily there are not
to exceed a couple but this year the
class is almost evenly divided. The
stage has already been erected on the
east side of the main building, and
practice goes on daily.
JUST RECEIVED A new supply of

awarded in the inter-society contest,
which will be held one evening during
commencement. The question for de
bate Wednesday evening is, "Resolved
that there should be an educational
qualification for voters equal to work
in the first eight grades of the public
school." The question will be defended
by Karl Leebrick and Clarence

resented by Halbert Miller and Alma
Jones.
A DAY OF QUILTING.
The Ladies' Aid Society of the Chris
tian church will meet at the home of

cial good time is anticipated. Those

lunches.
CAUGHT A YOUNG COYOTE.
While riding horseback through a
field a day or two ago, J. F. Haigler
came upon a family of coyote kittens.
There seemed to be more than half a
dozen in the bunch, but most of them
got to their burrow before he could
get very close. One, more bold than
the others, started across an adjoining
wheat field and by dismounting from
the horse he easily captured it. It
was taken to the house where it is be
ing fed on milk and gives promise of
making a nice pet.
WILL OCCUR AT LAST.
The entertainment called "An Old
Curiosity Shop," which was to have
been given some time ago by the la
dies of the M. E. church, but which

Albert Miller.

"GOOD GROWING WEATHER."
When the New Scalp Antiseptic is Used
A good head of hair is as much a
"crown of glory," for man as it is for
woman, notwithstanding all the eclat
on the subject applied to the female
sex exclusively. In the season when
flies bite, the bald-headed man can
sympathize with the Egyptians who
were so sorely plagued on account of
the children of Israel. Why not try
Newbro's Herpicide? Others have been
benefited and are loud in its praise. It
cleanses the scalp, kills the germ at
the root of the hair and by keeping the
scalp sweet, pure and wholesome, the
hair is bound to grow as nature intend
ed, regardless of the temperature. Try
it and be convinced. Sold by leading
druggists. Send 10c in stamps for
sample to The Herpicide Co., Detroit,

GROWING ACHES AND PAINS.
Mrs. Josie Sumner, Bremond, Texas,
writes, April 15, 1904: "I have used
Ballard's Snow Liniment in my fam
ily for three years. I would not be
without it in the house. I have used
it on my little girl for growing pains
and aches in her knees. It cured her
right away. I have also used it for
frostbitten feet with good success. It
is the best liniment I ever used."

BABY GIRL'S
Would Scab Over, Break Open, and Be Raw Intense Suffering for
Two Years Doctors and Medi
cines Failed to Help Her.
CURED BY CUTICURA
AT COST OF 75 CENTS
Writing under date of Aug. 15, 1904,
Mrs. L. C. Walker, of 5 Tremont St.,
Woodfords, Me., says: "My sister
had a terrible humor on her shoulder
when she was eighteen months old,
causing intense suffering for two years.
We had several doctors, and tried
everything, but in spite of all we
did it kept spreading. One day it
would scab over and then crack open
and a watery matter ooze from it and
the scabs would all fall off. It would
be raw for a time, then scab over
again. Someone recommended Cuticu
ra, and we immediately procured
a box of Cuticura Ointment, and a cake
of Cuticura Soap. She was much bet
ter after the first bath with warm water
and soap, and an application of the
Ointment. Before it was half gone we
saw a marked change for the better,
and she was entirely cured, without a
scar being left, by the one box of Oint
ment and one cake of Soap. Her skin
is now entirely clear, and she has
not had a sign of trouble since."

Daily Tell Other Mothers
That Cuticura Soap is the best baby
soap in the world for cleansing and
purifying the skin, and that Cuticura
Ointment is of priceless value for
soothing and healing itching, tortur
ing, and disfiguring eruptions, itch
ings, and scalings. A single appli
cation of Cuticura Ointment, preceded
by a warm bath with Cuticura Soap,
gives instant relief, and refreshing
