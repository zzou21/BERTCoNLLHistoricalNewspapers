IN FREIGHT YARDS

PLAYGROUND.

Parents Warned to Keep Children
Away From Railroad Tracks.

Inquire of Our
Depositors

If you are a stranger in Phoenix and are
contemplating a banking connection, we
wish to refer you to any of the hundreds
who have maintained business relations
with us continuously for the past thirty
years. This is the pioneer bank of the Salt
River alley, and its heaviest depositors
today are those whose accounts were small
when the bank was first organized. Ask
our depositors where you should make
your bank home they know us.

National Bank of
Arizona

A few days ago the ticket agent
of the Santa Fe was a spectator of
an odd dinner party. It was held
under a freight car in the switching
yards under a freight-car that might
have been moved any minute. The
invited guests were a number of
young boys of Phoenix who have
formed the "freight yard habit." The
menu began and ended with watermelon. This spectacle was the last straw
to the number of frights the agent
has had during the last year for fear
some of the boys who habituate the
place should be ground under the
wheels. The perilous leap from car to car of moving trains has been
taken by any number of boys be
tween the ages of 8 and 14, who are,
without doubt, said Mr. McNeley yesterday, there without the knowl
edge or consent of their parents. This
fact does not lessen their danger.
Similar complaints have been made
at various times by nearly every railroad office in the United States. The
railroad yards have been a popular
gathering place for boys of a certain
age ever since the first train was
known its first run. The youngsters
are attracted first by their wondering admiration for the machinery of

the engines. Later they are seized
with the wanderlust, and long to
board the moving cars to go any
where. They come to the shifting
yards again and again, and before
they know it, and before their par
ents know it, they have formed the
"jumping" habit, and there is no
more dangerous habit for a boy. Men
whose lives depend on being expert
at crossing the tops of the swaying
cars and leaping for the rods and
handholds meet with accidents.

Referring to this matter yesterday
General Agent W. S. Goldsworth
said: "The parents of these boys
should be notified of their danger and they should make it a point to
keep them away from the railroad
yards if they value their lives. We
have careful men in the yards, but a
crew of fifty could not keep these
youngsters from boarding the cars.
They climb all over them and under
them, regardless of the danger.

"I will communicate it to the police. I hope the parents of these
boys will take warning and keep the
children away from the freight yard
before an accident occurs. The yards
are dangerous playgrounds."

Fragments of Pottery and Human
Bones Laid Bare by Pick.

Two workmen of the Pacific Gas and
Electric company had a gruesome ex
perience yesterday about 11:30, when
one of the men, a Mexican laborer,
drove his pick into the remains of
a human skeleton. It was hard to
realize for a moment that the bones
were those of a man. When the jaw
bone, with teeth, and the unmistakable
curve, was dug up, there was no
longer any possibility of doubt.

Broken fragments of pottery were
found with the bones, and some of
the workmen believe the gas company
is driving its new main through a
prehistoric burial place. Whether the
grave disturbed yesterday is the only
one, or one of many, will be developed
as the work goes on.
The bones were crumbling, and
many could not be lifted without
breaking and falling in fine, white
powder. Although there is no way
of determining, on account of the ex
treme decay of the remains, the men
who were present at the time the
discovery was made believe there were
two people buried in the grave.
It is possible that the bones are all
that remain of people who lived thou
sands of years back, when the valleys
of the southwest were held by an
other race of men, who came and
went before the Aztecs. When they
were buried the site of Phoenix was
a desert, and the people who saw to
their interment may have thought
they were selecting a spot which
would never be disturbed.
o .
SHE HAD A BETTER PLAN.

PASTEURIZED MILK

It was the dreamy hour after the
Christmas dinner, and the girls were
talking in the hushed tones appropriate
to the occasion.
"I've just heard of a new charm to
tell whether anyone loves you, and if so, who it is," whispered Elsie.
"What is it?" queried Sophie, absently fingering with her new diamond ring.
"Well, you take four or five chest
nuts, name each one of them after
some man you know, and then put
them on the stove, and the first one
that jumps is the one that loves you."
"I'm," said Sophie; "I know a bet
ter way than that."
"Do you?"
"Yes, indeed. By my plan you take
one particular man, place him on the
sofa in the parlor, sit close to him
with the light a little low, and look
into his eyes. And then if he doesn't pop, you'll know it's time to change
the man on the sofa."

R. P. Davie, vice-president and gen
eral manager of the Southwestern Sugar
and Land Company, concerned in
other large undertakings in this valley,
and who was here from his home in Los
Angeles when the sugar campaign be
gan, returned again on Tuesday to see
how everything is going. He spent
Wednesday and a part of yesterday at
the factory and in riding about the
valley with a couple of friends who
came with him on this trip. Last even
ing he went to Marinette and tonight
will return to Los Angeles. Naturally
he is very much interested in the sugar
machinery just now, but admits that with
such a manager as Lafayette Myers in
charge, there is little for him to do ex
cept to stand around and feel good at
the way everything is going. But that
is enough, for when everything is go
ing as smoothly as it is now it is about
all one man can do to represent the
company in feeling good.

Mr. Davie is accompanied by Arthur
Reynolds and Lycurgus Lindsey of Los
Angeles, both being associated with his
investments in the valley, including the
enterprises of the sugar factory. Both
are well known Los Angeles capitalists.

Mr. Lindsey is largely concerned
in the operations of the Palmer Annex
Oil company, the Los Angeles Trust
Co., and the First National Bank of
Los Angeles. Their visit here is to
look over the projects in which Mr.
Davie has interested them and to sat
isfy their natural curiosity, for the
Salt River valley, like the Grand Can
yon, and the White House, is something
that every American should see some
time. Yesterday afternoon these gentlemen
held a sort of a "hot-air" reception on
the sidewalk in front of the Ford hotel,
so-called both because the tempera
ture warranted it and the event was
the meeting of various and sundry
friends, who grew reminiscent and
swapped stories of other days. Among
them was Patrick Molloy, who knew
Davie in Cripple Creek when his chief
claim to fame rested on the fact that
he organized R. P. D. hose company
No. 1 and had Molloy for spike on the
team.
Molloy told a great many things
about his old chief before he became
such a quiet and retiring old gentle
man, and when his vocations were
selling pills in a corner drug store
and running to fires. Mr. Davie on the
other hand recalled a number of things
that happened to Molloy before his hair
was silvered and he was weighted with
the heavy responsibilities of family life
and the career of a mining expert.

Among other things, the rivalry be
tween the R. P. D., and another Cripple
Creek hose team was mentioned. On
the occasion of one little fire in the
middle of a block, Molloy responded
so promptly that he pulled the cart
alone to the place of action, unreeled
his hose and got ready for business.
In the meantime the competing team
put in an appearance and did likewise.

When Captain Davie arrived, Molloy
and the other nozzle man stood facing
and deluging each other with water,
each swearing by the god of fires that
he was on the job first. In the mean
time, someone else had put out the in
cipient blaze.

Mr. Molloy is now engaged in min
ing in the Sierra Ancha mountains,
forty-five miles north of Roosevelt, and
is here enroute to Los Angeles where
his family resides.

When tempted to put the results of your savings,
which represent days, weeks or months or even years
of labor, into some questionable enterprise, remem
ber this:
It is better to get four per cent regularly with the
principal always yours, than to get perhaps seven
per cent this year and probably no principal the
rest of the time.
Four per cent and Safe is the Safe Course to fol
low unless you prefer speculation with the chances
involved.

A second Pan-Pacific congress
to be held at Honolulu, Hawaii, Feb
19 to 24, 1912. The honorary presi
dent is the governor of the island;
the president is W. H. McInerney, and
the secretary, H. P. Wood, who is
also secretary of the Honolulu cham
ber of commerce.

It is the duty of every expectant
mother to prepare her system for the
coming of her child; to avoid as
far as possible the suffering of such
occasions, and endeavor to pass
through the crisis with her health
and strength unimpaired. This she
may do through the use of Mother's
Friend, a remedy that has been so
long in use, and accomplished so
much good, that it is in no sense an
experiment, but a preparation which
always produces the best results. It
is for external application and so pen
etrating in its nature as to thoroughly
lubricate every muscle, nerve and ten
don involved during the period before
baby comes. It aids nature by ex
panding the skin and tissues, relieves
tenderness and soreness, and perfectly
prepares the system for natural and
safe motherhood. Mother's Friend
has been used and endorsed by thou
sands of mothers, and its use will
prove a comfort and a benefit to any
woman in need of such a remedy.

Mother's Friend
is sold at drug
stores. Write for
free book for
expectant moth
ers, which con
tains much valuable information.
