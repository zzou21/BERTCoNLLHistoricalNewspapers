FRIENDS OF THE PRESS.
House bill No. 80, a crystallization of
Mr. Skinner's distorted notions of re
trenchment, was yesterday filed away
among the archives of silly and impos
sible things. The bill itself is not of
much moment one way or another, ex
cept as a measure of the caliber of in
experienced reformers. Its passage
would not have impoverished the news
papers of the territory, nor will its
failure to pass enrich them.
The bill has, however, served a good
end, such an end as an invasion of
cholera or any similar calamity may
serve by developing or bringing to the
surface the nobility and humanity of
man. Mr. Skinner's bill was not suffi
ciently important, however, to be re
garded in the light of a calamity and
at its best, or rather its worst, hardly
deserved to be considered even a slight
irritant.
The purpose it served was to make
a striking array in the house of the
friends of the press, of the gentlemen
so mentally broad and liberal and just
as to appreciate the service and use
fulness of the newspapers of Arizona.
The highest commendation is due
Mr. Ross and Mr. Marshall for the sen
timents expressed by them yesterday
in their opposition to a measure which
expressed a hostility to the press of the
territory. Their opposition was one of
principle which makes it all the more
appreciative. They did not know that
the bill would greatly reduce the pres
ent rate for territorial and county print
ing. In fact they rather thought that
it would not, but that was not the point
at issue. The intention of the bill was
inimical and if it failed of effect it had
not been the purpose of the framer
that it should do so. The papers of the
territory had deserved well of Arizona
and had earned not only the support of
individuals but also public recognition.
Through them the resources of the ter
ritory had been made known to the
outside world.
Dr. Wright, Mr. Hunt and Mr.
Brewer have also shown themselves to
be true friends of the papers. Although
they took no active part in the debate
called out yesterday their opposition to
the printing bill from the day it was
given its first reading has been unceas
ing. Their work has been done in the
committee, in the corridors, on the
street and elsewhere.
The newspapers of Arizona will also
remember kindly the following public
spirited gentlemen whose votes yester
day will tend in the future to discour
age legislation of the Skinner variety:
Messrs. Behan, Bruce, Burke, Dryden,
Field, Heily, Rogers, Schumacher,
Southwick and Baxter.
It is not to be inferred that all gentle
men who supported the measure were

moved by a spirit of hostility toward
the newspapers. Most of them have in
fact shown from time to time that they
are not. Neither is it to be inferred
that they coincided with Mr. Skinner
in his misdirected scheme of retrench
ment. Concerning the part taken by news
papers in territorial affairs, Mr. Brewer
gave it as his opinion that in the mat
ter of the bonds alone the press of Ari
zona have deserved more than the ter
ritory can do for them. He believed
that it was the newspapers, supple
mental to the work of the loan commis
sion, that effected the remarkably fav
orable sale of the territorial bonds.

THE NEW CHARTER.
The bill introduced into the house by
Mr. Hurley to provide the city of Phoe
nix with a new charter, is one whose
course will be awaited with great in
terest and its passage is much to be de
sired. Its provisions were determined
by the gentlemen of the chamber of
commerce after having obtained the
fullest possible expression of the views
of those interested. That a new char
ter is almost indispensable none can
deny and that one based on the terms
of Mr. Hurley's bill will as nearly as
possible meet all requirements is equal
ly undeniable.
The charter voted down at the special
election contained two fatally objection
able features, one of which invested the
council with too great power while
the other deprived property owners of
any voice in the matter of improve
ments affecting them. In the new
charter, both of these evils will be cor
rected. It has been prepared by men who
have informed them as to the precise
needs of the city and it should be passed.
CLEAN UP.
Every day brings fresh news of the
spread of cholera in Europe. It has be
gun early, is spreading rapidly and this
country can hardly escape. It is the
duty of the government officials to keep
it out if they can, but we must not rely
on them. It is the duty of every city
and every citizen to do everything pos
sible to ward off the dreaded scourge.
Clean up; see that wells and ditches
are kept clean and pure, let old rubbish
be burned. Everyone can quarantine
against cholera, and other diseases at
the same time, by surrounding himself
with pure air and eating and drinking
pure food. To clean up and keep clean
will repay us a hundred-fold even if
cholera never crosses the ocean.
PUZZLE FOR THE EYES.
A Number of Very Pretty, et IliaXly
Mails, Optical Illusions.
The eye is a good and accurate instru
ment of measurement and comparison;
but it is not infallible. The English
periodical, Nature, printed lately a
pretty optical illusion which can be
easily described, and any of our read
ers who can draw fairly well can con
struct it for themselves.
Draw a figure to represent two pillars
surmounted by a gothic arch, three
inches wide outside and five inches high
from the base to the apex of the arch.
Let the pillars be one-fourth of an inch
wide, and let the arch spring from a
point three inches from the base of the
pillars. Now draw a third pillar one
half inch wide, so that one side of it
will cut the arch exactly in the apex
and will project an inch or two above.
You will be surprised to find that if
this be done neatly, so that the lines of
the arch do not show behind the third
pillar, the curves of one side of the arch
will seem to be lower than those of the
other.
The illusion is most complete when
the figure is drawn in outline without
any shading; and that part of the arch
which is concealed by the pillar should
be omitted, not rubbed out, as the traces
of the lines will destroy the illusion.
Another optical illusion is made very
simply by terminating lines in different
ways. The lines are not set directly
opposite one another, for if they were
the vision would easily be corrected.
The reader will find it of interest, first
to judge of the length of the lines, and
then to measure
them.
A puzzle al
most identical
with the above
was printed
a year or two ago in some of the trade
journals. The puzzle is, of course, to
determine by the eye alone which is the
longest and which the shortest of the
lines, A A, B B and C C.
In the third, curves are introduced to
confuse the measure still more. Look
at the cut and,
without measur
ing, say which is
the greater dis
tance across
the top of the
hat, or from top
to bottom.
Then put your own hat on the table,
about a yard in front of you, and care
fully reconsider the problem. When
you have made up your mind, take a
foot rule and measure your hat both
ways.
