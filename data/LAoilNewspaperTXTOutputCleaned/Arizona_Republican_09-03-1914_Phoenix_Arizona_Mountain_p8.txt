THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, THURSDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 3, 1914

IF

The ROSS Alfalfa Mills enable the feeder to grind Alfalfa, Corn Fodder, Clover Hay, Pea-vine Hay,
Kaffir Corn and Milo Maize in the head, with a portion or all of the stalk, either alone or mixed in
varied proportions with Wheat, Shelled Corn, Rye, Oats or any other small grain.
Feeders generally now have such a thorough understanding of the need for getting the maximum nu
trition to the animals that to attempt to feed the above mentioned products in any other form than
ground feed is gross wastefulness. We have them in two sizes come in and let us show you their
advantages.
