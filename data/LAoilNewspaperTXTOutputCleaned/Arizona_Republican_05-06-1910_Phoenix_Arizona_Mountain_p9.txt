MOTHER'S FRIEND

. A LINIMENT FOR EXTERNAL USE. ;

Baby's coming will be a time of rejoicing, and not of apprehension and fear, if Mother's Friend is used by the expectant mother in preparation of the event. This is not a medicine to be taken internally, but a liniment to be applied to the

body, to assist nature in the necessary physical changes of the system. Mother's Friend is composed of oils and medicines which prepare the muscles and tendons for the unusual strain, render the ligaments supple and elastic, aid in the expanding of the skin and flesh cords, and strengthen all the membranes and tissues. It lessens the pain and danger at the crisis, and assures future health to the mother. Mother's Friend is sold at drug stores. Write for our free book, containing valuable information for expectant Mothers.

A STILL WIDER USE
OF ARIZONA SANDSTONE

A Los Angeles Company for Development
of Quarries.

Los Angeles, Cal., May
(Correspondence of The Republican.)

The Pacific Consolidated Stone company, a Los Angeles corporation which recently acquired the grand sandstone quarries at Flagstaff, Arizona, is preparing to develop the property on an unprecedented scale. H. L. Thornton, who for twenty years was identified with the Hertford, Indiana, quarries, and who has furnished the material for many of the finest buildings, both public and private, on the continent, is a member of the Pacific Consolidated and has been made general manager of its properties. Under his guidance it is believed Arizona sandstone will

be made to take its proper place among the building materials used not only in the southwest, but in the whole country.

Among federal, state and municipal buildings, clubs, churches, residences, etc., in which Arizona sandstone has been used, are:
Residence of Bishop Warren, Louis Mack block, Brown Palace hotel, Denver Athletic club, Club building, Arapahoe; Ernest & Cramer building, D. K. Ut residence, R. McFarland residence, Hotel Metropole, Frank Dillingham residence, Dr. Leinen residence, in Denver; Tempe normal school in Tempe, Arizona; public library in Phoenix; Indian schools in Truxton Canyon, Arizona; Commercial Club building and four school buildings in Albuquerque, N. M.; Methodist church, Hotel Adams, Goodrich building, Carnegie library of Phoenix; a normal school in Arizona; Oregonian building in Portland, Oregon; postoffice in Sacramento; city hall, county courthouse, Bradbury building, residence of Alfred Salomon, Harper & Reynolds building, Willard Stinson block, postoffice, O. T. Johnson building, Hotel Lankershim, federal building and postoffice, Westminster hotel, Henne block, Lankershim building, Germain building, La Franco building, I. W. Hellman building.

The building materials used not only

in Los Angeles, but in many buildings throughout California and Arizona and in Mexico, attest the beauty and general excellence of the stone.

Arizona sandstone resists a strain of about 5,000 pounds per square inch, which will stand the weight of the stone in a column over a mile high without crushing. It was used in the Oregonian building, Portland, Oregon. The building is nine stories high, with a corner sixty-three feet higher than the main building. Arizona stone was used for the first three stories of both building and tower in 1891, and is in perfect condition today.

Owing to its very fine texture and to its being void of sharp grit, Arizona sandstone has very few equals for ease in working. It has no superior for fine carving, admitting of very heavy relief and presenting clean, sharp edges. It is without doubt the best sandstone in the United States for figure carving. In the Spreckels mansion, San Francisco, built of Arizona sandstone, in a balustrade which shows on both sides, several panels were set which were afterwards carved in scroll work, leaving after carving less than one-eighth of the original panel. These stones were all set before carving and not one was broken in working.

While color is a matter of taste alone, the fact that the brownstones have always been the most popular of all building stones presupposes a reason. A dark stone gives a building a gloomy or sombre appearance. The lighter grays and buffs do not give the appearance of massiveness and stability suitable to a stone structure. The brown stones alone give the desired harmonious effect. The brown stones also work very well in combination with brick, giving both contrast and harmony which is very desirable. Arizona sandstone is a very bright and peculiar shade of brown. It is warm in color, but has none of the reddish brick tint so common to many brown stones. It does not fade or dull by exposure and presents a better appearance in large quantities in completed buildings owing to its absolute uniformity of color than in smaller samples. The ability to withstand the severe cold of winter in many building stones is owing to the large percent of water absorbed. The average absorption of sandstones is from 3 to 13 per cent of the bulk of the stone. Arizona sandstone absorbs 3.76 per cent of moisture, which places it among the very best of sandstones. Ohio sandstones (with a national reputation) absorb 6.35 per cent of moisture, nearly twice as much.

The new million dollar federal building in Los Angeles is built of Arizona sandstone and is pronounced by those who know to be one of the most beautiful government buildings in the country outside of the city of Washington. The development of the Flagstaff quarries on the scale proposed by the Pacific Consolidated Stone Company means much to Arizona, as, not only will it bring money to the territory, but will serve to advertise it as well.

This mill will be equipped with the latest in stone working machinery and will give employment to about 100 skilled men.

The quarries at Flagstaff have been worked in a more or less desultory fashion for the past fifty years and in working, it has no superior for fine carving, admitting of very heavy relief and presenting clean, sharp edges. It is without doubt the best sandstone in the United States for figure carving.

All aboard for the following Hotels, Summer Resorts, etc. You can wear knock-about clothes or a dress suit, fish, hunt, sail or camp, play tennis, golf, bowl, dance or lose yourself among shady nooks and quiet retreats.

Arizona sandstone resists a strain of about 5,000 pounds per square inch, which will stand the weight of the stone in a column over a mile high without crushing. It was used in the Oregonian building, Portland, Oregon.

The building is nine stories high, with a corner sixty-three feet higher than the main building. Arizona stone was used for the first three stories of both building and tower in 1891, and is in perfect condition today.

In selecting a building stone it is essential that it possesses strength, durability and a pleasing color; that can be worked easily; that can be finished in large sizes if desired, and that can be obtained without delaying the construction of the building.
