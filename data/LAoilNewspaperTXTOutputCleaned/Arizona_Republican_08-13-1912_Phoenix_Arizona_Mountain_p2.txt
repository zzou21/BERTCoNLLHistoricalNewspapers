All
Indications Point Toward a Splendid School Year
Barely a month more and the Tempe
normal school will open for its nine-
month term which begins on the ninth
day of September. President A. J.
Matthews says that judging from all
present indications this will be the
best school year the institution has
enjoyed yet. An unusually large
number of inquiries are being re-
ceived at this early date in regard to
the time of opening and accommoda-
tions the dormitories will afford.
Some are planning to move to Tempe
and rent a home where they may en-
joy the full benefits of Tempe's school
facilities. In other cases there are
some who desire to find a place where
they can work for their board and
room and attend school. This has
become a common custom in past
years and a number of the students
have worked their own way through
in that way. If there are any who
care to take a student on those con-
ditions they can most likely make
arrangements with President Matth-
ews to do so.
In the way of repair work in antici-
pation of the coming year there has
been more done this summer than
probably ever before in one season.
Every room in both dormitories has
been thoroughly overhauled, re-
calci-
mined and the woodwork varnished.
All the furniture has also been revar-
nished. In the rear of the girls' dor-
mitory there has been constructed two
new large sleeping porches making a
total of three and giving room enough
to allow every inmate to sleep out-
side if they desire. In the rear of the
boys' dormitory has been built anoth-
er large sleeping porch extending the
full length of the building which will
also accommodate all the inmates.
Following the general custom the
school buildings have all been thor-
oughly cleaned and revarnished and in
some instances new furnishings put in.
The faculty this year will be com-
posed of every member that served
last year with the exception of Dr. T.
L. Bolton. His place will be filled by
Prof. F. C. Aver who previous to last
year served the normal for three years
in the capacity of teacher of biology
and physiology. This year he will
have charge of these two subjects and
possibly one other.
AUTO PARTY HOME
Councilman Frank Fogal and S. Z.
Earl returned late Saturday night from
a month's outing in the northern part
of the state. The trip was made over

WOMAN SICK
TWELVE YEARS
Wants Other Women to Know
How She Was Finally
Restored to Health.
Louisiana, Mo.: "I think a woman
naturally dislikes to make her troubles
known to the public,
but complete restor-
ation to health means
so much to me that
I cannot keep from
telling mine for the
sake of other suffer-
ing women.
"I had been sick
about twelve years,
and had eleven doc-
tors. I had
dragging down pains,
down pains at monthly periods, bilious spells,
and was getting worse all the time. I
would hardly get over one spell when I
would be sick again. No tongue can tell
what I suffered from cramps, and at
times I could hardly walk. The doctors
said I might die at one of those times,
but I took Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
ble Compound and got better right away.
Your valuable medicine is worth more
than mountains of gold to suffering wo-
men." Mrs. Bertha Muff, 503 N. 4th
Street, Louisiana, Mo.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, made from native roots and herbs,
contains no narcotic or harmful drugs,
and today holds the record of being the
most successful remedy for female ills we
know of, and thousands of voluntary
testimonials on file in the Pinkham
laboratory at Lynn, Mass., seem to prove
this fact.
If you want special advice write to
Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Co. (con-
fidential) Lynn, Mass. Your letter will
be opened, read and answered by a
woman and held in strict confidence.

bound first for Camp Verde where a
short time was spent at the Tempe
Verde Oil company well, accompanying
them at that time were L. L. Har-
mon, Dr. W. G. Devore and C. G. Jones
but when travel towards the north
was resumed the latter two gentle-
men remained at the well to super-
vise work being done there in the
absence of I. V. Stewart. The Grand
Canyon and Flagstaff were first vis-
ited by the party, after which they
took in practically all the other scenic
points of interest in that part of the
country. At Oak Creek a short time
was spent fishing and hunting. On
the return to Camp Verde another
side trip was taken to Mr. Harmon's
range about fifty miles from Prescott.
Mr. Fogal's range, located at Date
Creek, came in for the last visit and
there Mrs. Fogal and the children
were left to remain until school opens
the coming month. Messrs. Earl and
Fogal report a very pleasant and in-
teresting trip throughout, there being
very little trouble experienced with
the automobiles. The roads are said
to be rather bad in places but in no
instance were they forced to cover
any extra ground on that account.
The remainder of the party which is
now located at Camp Verde is ex-
pected home the latter part of this
month.

are heated and get a stiff neck or

FROM PHOENIX
John Hyder, of the firm of Hyder
Bros., spent Sunday in Tempe from
Phoenix.
NEARLY FINISHED
W. H. Salyer's new residence on
East Eighth street is now nearly com-
pleted there being little left other
than the finishing work to do. It is
thought that everything will be con-
cluded and ready for occupancy by
the middle of the month. Mr. Sal-
yer plans to move his family in at
once.
REMAINS SENT EAST
The remains of John Fauver, who
died last Thursday, were sent to the
home of his parents in the east Friday
night. Mr. Fauver came here several
months ago suffering from tubercu-
losis trouble but apparently he was
too far gone for the change to have
any effect upon his condition.
TEMPE VISITOR
F. R. Marsh, proprietor of the Casa
Loma hotel, was over from Phoenix
yesterday afternoon looking after
business interests.
CASA LOMA GUESTS
Those registered at the Hotel Casa
Loma yesterday were: V. Alexander,

son, Phoenix; Stanley Hibbs, Phoe-
nix; Ed F. Rassat, Phoenix.
GOOD HUNTING
Local sportsmen report the white
wings to be unusually thick in the
district south of here this summer.
Every day someone can be found
hunting in that territory and nearly
always with good success. Especially
on Sunday is the country filled with
hunters. Phoenix parties have spent
the day south of here off and on for
the past month. For the past number
of years it has been the custom of a
few Los Angeles men to spend a week
in the Kyrene district just shooting
birds. So far this summer, though,
they have not shown up.
BARN DESTROYED BY WIND
The Kyrene Land and Improvement
company suffered a rather expensive
loss Sunday evening when its large
barn on the J. B. Flumerfelt ranch
was blown to pieces. The barn was
full of baled hay but there was prob-
ably little injury to the latter.
TO FLAGSTAFF
F. H. Simmons left last night to
spend ten days at Flagstaff with his
wife who has been there the greater
part of the summer.
TRIAL POSTPONED
The trial of Ramon Chavez, which
was to have been held in the local
court yesterday afternoon has been
postponed a week. The cause of the
delay is due to the chemists who are
examining the whiskey which it is
alleged the offending man sold.
RETURNED TO SCHOOL
Cecil Windes left yesterday morning
for Flagstaff where he will enter the
northern Arizona normal school which
commences the winter term this morn-
ing. LIGHTNING AND RAIN
Tempe was visited Sunday evening
with another of its lately accustomed
showers. The Kyrene country that

NEWS

afternoon, though, received one of the
heaviest rains of the year. Some of
those who witnessed it described it as
a cloudburst but at all events enough
water fell to practically flood every-
thing. The belt in which it fell only
came within eight miles of town and
it is not known how far south it
went. On the I. B. Brooks ranch, lo-
cated in supposedly the heaviest part
of the cloudburst a cow was killed
by lightning. Mr. Brooks had just
bought a herd of milch cows the day
before and it was a member of this
herd that was the victim of the storm.
She was standing under a tree, the
lightning first striking that. It caught
the cow on the back and fairly singed
all the hair off her entire body, going
down the two hind legs into the
ground.
CONVICTS LOSE A GAME
The convict nine lost a ball game
Sunday afternoon to what is left of
the local town team. The game was
fairly close all the way through
though terminating in a score of seven
to nine. The convicts seem to put in
a greater part of Sunday, playing ball,
for during the early part of the after-
noon they played a game with an
Indian nine from the north side. Good
practice was derived by all from the
two games and that is just what the
local boys are looking for. Spikes
and Mullen, who have been at Fort
Huachuca for the past twelve days
with the militia are expected home
today so that the Tempe nine will be
complete once more and ready for
other teams of the valley.
"Were all medicines as meritorious
as Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and

be much better off and the per-
centage of suffering greatly de-
creased," writes Lindsay Scott, of

gists. MESA
HELD TO ANSWER
ON BURGLARY CHARGE
Hat Worn By One of the Prisoners
Contained Name of Man Whose
Goods Were Taken from Car
In justice court yesterday Mamie:
Alea res and Aurelia S. Tornezon were
held to answer on a charge of havi-
ing entered a car used by August Zahn
at a residence at Queen Creek, Au-
gust 8th. The men will be taken to
the county jail at Phoenix today to
await action by the superior court.
At the preliminary held yesterday
the two men swore that they were
in Mesa on the 5th, accompanied by
a third man, one Jose Ruiz, and that
at 10:00 that afternoon they met
a white man at the corral near the
creamery and from him bought the
plunder that they had in their pos-
session when arrested, except the
rifle, which they claimed was loaned
to them by Jose Ruiz. The fact that
they claimed they went from Mesa di-
rect to the Weeks' ranch,
then right to Superior, when
the hat of old clothing bearing J
name was found near the car
discredited their statement.
A hat
worn by one of them was a new hat,
somewhat soiled. August Zahn said
that he lost a hat of the same kind
when the car was robbed, but that
his hat had a horsehair band sewed
over the original band, black thread
being used. An examination of the
band found several ends of black
thread clinging to the inside of the
hat and sticking through the hat
band. Still Mr. Zahn did not like to
swear to the hat, because it was quite
dirty and his was a clean one, but
he felt pretty certain it was his prop-
erty. He had forgotten whether he
wrote his name in the hat or not.
Constable Burton examined the hat
again and on the inside of the sweat
band, somewhat dim but easily dis-
tinguishable with the naked eye, was
found the name. "A. Zahn." This evi-
dence and the fact that the flour
sacks in which they carried the
plunder contained the address of B. C.
Irons, Higley, were sufficient to hold
the men to the higher court. It left
no doubt of their guilt, taken in con-
nection with the story they had told
of their travels.

AN INTERESTING GUIDE
R. B. LaFamboy, publisher of the
Arizona Guide, was in Mesa yester-
day delivering copies of his publi-
cation to the people most interested.
The August number contains a large
amount of valuable information, in-
cluding time tables of all the rail-
roads in the state, their connections
with stage lines and auto lines, the
various roads of the state, a list of
the leading hotels, and a map show-
ing the various routes by which any
section in Arizona can be reached
by wagon or auto. Mesa has a two
page advertisement, one of the pages
showing the Mahoney block ten years
ago and a view of the same block as
seen today. The other page displays
a new map of the roads show-
ing the state highway in completing
the work. The data from which this
map was made was secured from the
state engineer's office.
Mr. W. S. Gunsalus, a farmer liv-
ing near Fleming, Pa., says he has
used Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy in his family for
fourteen years, and that he has
found it to be an excellent remedy,
and takes pleasure in recommending
it. For sale by all druggists.
DEATH OF BROTHER
Mrs. M. B. Cosper and Harry
Jones
have just received word of the
death
of their brother, Dr. R. Bryson
Jones,
which occurred at Marietta, Okla., on
August 7th. Dr. Jones had been ill
a long time, being confined to his bed
for five months. Typhoid fever was
the primary cause of death, liver com-
plications setting in toward the last.
Mr. Jones was the oldest member of
the family of children, his age being
34 years. He leaves a wife and three
young children. Dr. Jones was also
a cousin of Mrs. G. S. Irwin of Mesa.
Mrs. Cosper and Mr. Harry Jones
feel the death of their brother very
much, as only a short time since they
had word that he was apparently get-
ting better, the fever had left him
and the doctors gave hope of ulti-
mate recovery.

dose of Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera

IN POLICE COURT
The police justice was quite busy
yesterday morning. Marshal Peterson
picked up a young man who was
trying to carry a heavier load than
is allowed by law, especially in a lo-
cal option district and on Sunday at
that. The marshal persuaded the
man that it did not become the dig-
nity of the town to labor so strenu-
ously on the Sabbath evening. The
delinquent put up seven dollars as a
guarantee of good faith. Two other
young men were taken in for the of-
fense of disturbing the slumbers of
peaceful citizens by loud and nerve
racking noises, and one of them con-
fessed that he was in error and was
fined ten dollars. The third secured a
stay of proceedings and his case will
be heard today.

BACK FROM RANCH
D. H. Kleinman returned Sunday
evening from his cattle ranch out to-
ward Florence, where he had spent
several days looking after the live-
stock and things generally. Mr. Klein-
man reports everything flourishing in
that part of the range country, the
stock looking fine.
PEACHES FOR EXHIBIT
Mrs. W. A. Trent brought a box of
fine peaches to the Mesa Commer-
cial club for exhibition in the Pacific
Electric building, Los Angeles, yester-
day. The peaches were boxed and
sent to their destination by the Mesa
Commercial club. Other fruit for the
exhibit has been promised. The club
hopes to make a good showing for
this section, as it will be a big ad-
vertisement for the Mesa section of
the Salt river valley.
TAKING VACATION
Miss Josie Trinkle, reporter for
the Free Press is laying off this
week for a short vacation. She has
been a steady worker and has earned
a short lay off.
RETURNED FROM CASA GRANDE
Charles Smith and S. H. Sabin are
back from an auto ride to Casa
Grande, where Mr. Sabin is the own-
er of some very valuable mining
property. They had a safe run and
found everything looking fine. Mr.
Smith is branching out as quite an
expert, and has been the successful
promoter of the Roosemore mine, lo-
cated twenty-eight miles from Mesa.
STORE ROBBED
The general store at Chandler was
broken into Sunday night and con-
siderable money and property taken.
The officers went down there yester-
day to investigate, and think they
have found clues that will lead to
the apprehension of the burglars. The
amount of the loss has not yet been
reported. The store was kept by E.
E. Morrison and the United States
postoffice is located in the same
building.
NEWS IN BRIEF
W. A. Tway has a force of men at
work on his alfalfa field, turning hay
that got caught in the rain Sunday
night. He had just sent out a party

of men to begin baling hay yester-
day morning, when the rain began
falling.
The weather observer gave out the
following report yesterday: Maximum
temperature, 98; minimum, 73; mean,
85; character of day, partly cloudy;
precipitation, .10 inch. Forecast un-
settled, with rain.
Mrs. Carruthers of the Mesa Inn
has made another cleanup at her
place, thus setting a good example.
She has had the lawn mowed and all
the Johnson grass and weeds pulled
up, thus adding to the appearance of
the premises.
Max Viault is away for a short
business outing, and is not expected
back for a week.
A report was current yesterday
morning that lightning had done con-
siderable damage east of town, but
this was not confirmed.
Phil Mets and party have decided to
start for the mountains
if it doesn't rain.
next Monday
RETURNED TO COAST
Sol X. Sheridan, representative of
the Sunset Magazine, left last even-
ing for the coast and will begin at
once putting the material gathered
while here in shape for the printers.
The copy will be first submitted to
the Mesa Commercial club for ap-
proval. While here Mr. Sheridan was
kept on the move. He was aided in
getting the desired information by
members of the club, particularly W.
S. Dorman, M. R. Bowen, J. J. Fraser
and the assistant secretary. The Al-
lison Bros., Phil Mets, M. P. Holladay,
D. C. Babbitt and others gave Mr.
Sheridan valuable information, in-
cluding statistics. In the matter of
information regarding the canals, Mr.
Howard S. Reed supplied important
and correct data, from official files
in his office facts that would have
been impossible to obtain from any
other source.
A short time later a photographer
will be here to take many views of
the town and surrounding country,
for it is the intention of the Com-
mercial club to leave nothing undone
to make the advertising booklet at-
tractive as well as filled with cor-
rect information regarding this part
of the Salt river valley.
CHILD DROWNED
The little two-year-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. Angel Tapia fell in the wa-
ter ditch at the Harry Chandler ranch
near town, Saturday evening and was
drowned. The little one was swept
down and lodged against a headgate
and when the gate was raised to let
the water out, was found by the
searchers. The child had wandered
from the house and fell in while un-
observed by the parents. No one was
to blame for the accident, beyond the
carelessness of the parties who had
charge of the child's welfare. It was
one of those accidents that is liable
to happen to any of the small child-
ren of parents living close to the
canals and ditches, if parents or
guardians fail to keep close watch on
them. Little Angelito was buried yes-
terday. NOT BULL MOOSERS
Saturday afternoon. Jay C. Sexton,
Ed W. Jones, C. A. Baldwin, Charles
Pine, Dan Hibbert and one or two
other republicans attended a confer-
ence of the faithful at the Hotel
Adams. It was expected that Chair-
man Hubbell would be present, as
there were representatives from other
counties, but Mr. Hubbell was caught
in a railroad wreck and failed to ar-
rive. After a short and enthusiastic
meeting, an adjournment was taken
to await the arrival of the state
chairman. It was shown at the con-
ference that the Bull Moosers had
failed to corral a great number of the
republicans of the county, and re-
ports from other counties was to the
effect that the one man party was
losing its grip on the republican
voters of the state.
SPENT DAY AT HOME
John A. Gaut, business man of
Phoenix but a resident of the Mesa
section, spent Sunday with his fam-
ily. Mr. Gaut drives a dandy auto
and is very generous in giving his
friends free rides.
MEDALS DISTRIBUTED
The pupils of the high school who
won the medals offered by various
business men of Mesa were distributed
by Prof. Robertson last week. For
the best four years scholarship, Miss
Tlan Brack carried off the honors.
She was given the Lesueur & Co.
prize. Miss Brack's average for the
four years was 93 and a fraction.
The Republican medal, for the best
essay was won by Miss Josie Trinkle.
For declamation, Miss Mabel Clark
received the Free Press medal.
Dr. A. J. Chandler gave a medal
for the best declamation, and Walter
Longmoor was the successful con-
testant. FINE FRUIT
Nearly every fruit grower in the
Mesa section can show as fine fruit
as grows in any country finer than
that produced in many localities where
the people brag of their products.
An especially large peach was taken
to the Commercial club which was
grown in J. B. Lauffer's orchard. It
weighed one pound, and was 13
inches in circumference one way and
twelve inches around the cross way.

A fine collection of pears was
brought in by Mrs. W. A. Trent, for
preserving as part of the commercial
exhibit.
Sam L. Williams brought a sample
from his orchard, which was especial-
ly fine as to coloring and flavor.
In addition to the various fruits,
Geo. Radell brought in from the A
May farm, near Mesa, five ears of
White Dent corn, four of the ears
measuring nine inches each and the
other a trifle over eight inches. The
kernels are all well developed mak-
ing a fine showing. The corn was
planted in March and gathered July
20th.
Fine samples of Egyptian corn, or
maize, were also contributed by W. C.
Smith, who owns a forty of the best
land in the valley. At least he thinks
it some of the best, and forms his
judgment by what the soil produces.
WILL LEAVE NEXT WEEK
Phil Mets and his party of moun-
tain climbers will leave early next
week for the Pine and other sections
of the mountain country. They will
remain several weeks. Another party,
headed by Ed W. Jones, are trying to
get ready to start at the same time,
planning to return about the first.
