MUCH SILVER VEIN

prospectors Make a Good Find
Near Silver King.
Early days in Arizona was a most silver-producing -- its
early reputation as a territory was largely built on
that foundation. But when silver ceased to be the metal
and the world its light talk to gold and copper, attention
within the often must in Arizona. The result has
been no big silver mines have developed for years and a great
many, if they ever knew it, have lain idle. A clear is an Arizona
good silver mine is a good thing at the low price of silver.
It is of course, that it is rich.
Jake Pfeiffer and H. Montes
party went out prospecting a
one ago and returned home
with ore samples that, to say
give them courage to con-
tinue operations on the vein to
they went up into the Silver
King, with which they were
less familiar, and about a mile
farther north of that famous
mine, onto a little ledge only a
few four inches thick, that excited
curiosity. They sunk down on it
to twenty-five feet and it
widened out to two feet and
they had better find out
they were digging in before they
try farther, they came back to
town with an assortment of ore
samples, which they turned over to
Porterlie to assay. He made the
assay yesterday and says the best
ran 1,000 ounces in silver and
.01 once in gold. The lowest re-
ture 305 ounces in silver and no
doubt. Porterlie says the ore is
likely the same as the samples
taken from the Silver King and
carries stromeyerite or silver-
glance, antimonial silver, ruby
and native silver.

Old Silver King which is said
to have been first discovered by one
Captain Grooks soldiers while on a
campaign against the Indians, and
worked and worked, has been a
famous mine, in its day, and no
doubt will be again when it is sys-
tematically worked, though its history
is a variegated one. Some of the
richest and most attractive speci-
mens of native silver ever found any-
where have come from that mine, and
a large amount of the white metal has
been taken out of it in the past. It is
quite possible or, for that matter, im-
probable, that the recent discovery
to-day prove equally as rich.
Many have prospected the hills
in that vicinity without satisfying re
sults.

"TRUST."

He throws aside all caution and
doesn't seem to care a rap

In a lull, he sez, sez he;
"Ju'st need some o' Alaska," and he
takes it with a swallow;
"Yer Uncle lets me take it jest as

PAN-AMERICAN STAMPS.
Various Series Authorized By the
P. O. Department.
Washington, April 4. Announcement
was made at the postoffice department
to-day that arrangements have been
completed for turning out the new
Pan-American stamps and that the
printing of the issue will be com-
menced within a few days. Those who
have been favored with a glimpse of
the proofs already run off pronounced
the stamps the most artistic series ever
issued by the United States govern-
ment. Like the series issued in com-
memoration of the Columbian and
Jamestown-Mississippi expositions those intended to commemorate the show to
be held at Buffalo this summer are of
many denominations and each of a par-
ticular tint and shade. The builders
take the colors of the regular series
on the same denominations in use.
The words "Commemorative Series,
1901," and "United States of America"
next below appear above the vignette:
the legend in a line below the central
opening, with the denomination in a
line at the bottom, appears in the same
order on all the stamps of the series.
All the lettering is in white Roman
capitals. All the central illustrations
are from photographs as the objects
represented appear today, and are to
be printed in black. These designs are
as follows:
One Cent The black lake steamer
presents the port bow, the pilot house
is well forward and it is propelled by
side wheels. Color, green.
Two Cent A train of four cars
drawn by a locomotive with four driv
ing wheels; four parallel tracks are shown.
Color, red.
Four Cent An automobile of the
closed coach order, with two men on
the box and a part of the United
States capitol at Washington in the
background. Color, red brown.
Five Cent A view of the largest
single span steel bridge in the world:
two trolley cars are seen upon it, and
a full view of Niagara Falls is seen
under, beyond and up the river. Color,
blue.
Eight Cent A view of the great ship
canal locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
Color, lilac.
Ten Cent An ocean steamship of the
American line, with two smokestacks
and masts, presenting its starboard
bow lapped by a rising wave. Color,
light brown.
It is expected that the entire series
will be ready to be issued to post-
masters about the 26th of this month
and will be placed on sale throughout
the country May 1.

"THE ANGEL OF THE ALLEY"
Coming Soon Just a Little of the riot
and Story,
The haunts of New York city and the
characters of the wretches who infest
them; this may seem an exaggerated
and melodramatic offering. It is not. Its
central motive is founded on facts, and
the realistic representations are literal
reproductions of actual conditions.
They are sensational; they are surpris-
ing; they are funny; they are un-
familiar, but they are there.
SYNOPSIS.
The play opens in one of the pictur
esque underground dives so common in
the lower part of New York. Gamblers
of the type of Harry Morgan lure their
victims there with the assistance of un
scrupulous women, such as Ethel Sheri-
dan. She decoys Walter Bennett to the
den and persuades him to join in a
friendly game. Walter notices that
Bob Turner, another gambler, cheats,
and tells him so. The latter insults him
and Walter, who has been drugged
half crazed threatens to kill Turner.
Morgan snatches up the burning lamp
and throws it at Walter's head, but the
depraved Ethel pulls him away, and
the lamp crashes against the wall and
extinguishes. In the darkness Morgan
draws Walter's revolver out of the lat-
ter's hip pocket and shoots his pal,
Turner, then drops the weapon by the
dead body. As the lights flare up every
one realizes that a foul murder has
been committed, and as Walter was the
last one to quarrel with Turner, all ac
cuse him of being the assassin. The only
one who believes in his innocence is
Ethel, the woman who first decoyed
him. Realizing that every proof of
guilt points against him, she advises
him to fly, which he does, and, with her
assistance, after an exciting struggle,
reaches the street in safety.
The second act shows "The Alley,"
and in one of its miserable houses Wal
ter is hidden by Ethel, but, after think
ing the matter over, he gives himself
up for trial, knowing the woman can
swear and prove that Morgan fired the
fatal shot. Morgan, realizing that Ethel
will betray him, abducts and transports
her to a lonely hut on the Palisades,
where he uses every means, even tor
turing her, to make her swear that Wal
ter is the murderer. However, at the
last moment, after most thrilling
events, she is rescued through the
clever machinations of two friends.
The third act takes the spectator to
the condemned cell and electrocution
chamber in Sing Sing prison, showing
for the first time the instrument of
death so widely known. The entire
scene is taken from a photograph of
the original, secured through the ser
vices of a newspaper man. Walter Ben
nett is awaiting his hour of execution,
Ethel, on account of her abduction, be-
ing unable to save him from convic-
tion. His mother comes to bid him a
last farewell. All hope seems to have
vanished. Ethel, after her clever and
daring rescue, has mysteriously disap
peared again. She is the only one who
can save the innocent Walter. The hour
of death arrives and still no sign of
Ethel. The clock strikes the hour. With
a heart-rending shriek the mother is
forced to leave her boy. The very
heavens seem to frown upon the execu
tion of the unjust sentence. Flashes of
lightning are seen through the barred
window the rolls of thunder seem like
a dirge. The suspense is terrible. The
executioner reaches his hand to the
death-dealing button the mother
shrieks for mercy a terrific crash the
other wall of the chamber has crum
bled to dust Ethel, on horseback, ap
pears in the breach the man is saved.
In the fourth and last act, after a few
more exciting events, all is straightened
out, right triumphs, and villainy is
justly punished.
The comedy element has not been
forgotten. The parts of Pat Mulligan,
Willie Brummell, Nancy Oliver and
Mrs. Katzenjammer will afford no end
of laughter. Specialties of the highest
order and merit will be introduced, and
we promise an evening of unalloyed
pleasure and enjoyment to all who wit
ness "The Angel of the Alley."

CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD.
Marion Rooke, manager for G. M.
Thompson, a large importer of fine mill
inery at 1658 Milwaukee avenue, Chi
cago, says: "During the late severe
weather I caught a dreadful cold which
kept me awake at night and made me
unfit to attend my work during the
day. One of my milliners was taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy for a se
vere cold at that time, which seemed
to relieve her so quickly that I bought
some for myself. It acted like magic
and I began to improve at once. I am
now entirely well and feel very pleased
to acknowledge its merits." For sale

Shop-Worn Socks.
The National Advertiser tells a story
of an old bachelor who bought a pair of
socks and found attached to one of
them a slip of paper with these words:
"I am a young lady of 20 and would
like to correspond with a bachelor,
with a view to matrimony." Name and
address were given. The bachelor
wrote and in a few days got this letter:
"Madonna was married 30 years ago.
The merchant you bought those socks
from evidently did not advertise or he
would have sold them long ago. Mam
ma handed me your letter and said
possibly I might suit you, I'm 18 years
old."
Man's Iruishedness to Insects.
According to Grant Allen, in the
Strand Magazine, beetles and other in-
sects participate man in the burial of
the dead and meaning of his body by
devouring and burning dead animals
where they emit the smell and promote
the growth of vegetation. "There is,"
he says, "hardly a human trade or civ
ilization which does not find its
counterpart in animal and vegetable
life."
GOOD ADVICE.
The most miserable beings in the
world are those suffering from Dyspep
sia and Liver Complaint. More than
seventy-five per cent of the people in
the United States are afflicted with
these two diseases and their effects;
such as Sour Stomach, Sick Headache,
Habitual Costiveness, Palpitation of
the Heart, Heartburn, Wakefulness,
Gnawing and Burning Pains at the Pit
of the Stomach, Yellow Skin, Coated
Tongue and Disagreeable Taste in the

ing, Low Spirits, etc. Go to your Drug

tion of the two hemispheres of the

FACTS ABOUT THE LADRONES.

The Ladrones are northeast of the
Caroline Islands and three thousand miles
east of the Philippines, not over a day's journey from either.
Although small and apparently in
consequential, for few people have
ever heard of the Ladrones until now,
these islands have an ancient history.
They were discovered by Magellan in
1521.
A nut which can be eaten on shell and
shell is one of the islands' richer prod-
ucts. The shell is in its like a cracker,
sweet and good. The inside has a kernel
which can only be bitten when the
fruit is fresh.
There are 11 of the Ladrone islands,
but the principal ones are Agrigan,
Rota, Tinian, Guam. The
others are not regularly inhabited, being
used for special purposes such as
farming by the inhabitants of the La-
drones. A very queer mineral product is a
stone which changes color in the at-
mosphere. Cold days it is black, hot
days it is bright red, when rain
threatens it is pinkish and in cloudy
weather it is blue. This stone lies on
the highways and the pedestrian can
test it for weather.
The queer things in the Ladrones in-
clude a tree, the fruit of which is so
obnoxious to the natives that a negro
cannot "keep its stomach" and smell
it. But once past the nose it is indig-
enous that he will eat until too full
to walk. This fruit ripens once a
month and is plentiful.
For a long time these islands were
regarded as too volcanic to be habit-
able by civilized people. They are
thinly studded with volcanoes, which
are smoothed in a large mountain range,
which runs through all the islands.
Along the shore there is a rich, fertile
soil in which all things can be grown.
Queen Maria Anne of Austria, widow
of Philip IV., king of Spain, received a
present from them of a quantity of
large, rich bread fruit which so pleased
her that she requested that the islands
be named after her. Accordingly in
1669 the Ladrone islands were renamed
Mariana, after the queen of Spain, and
such has been their legal name ever
since, although they are still popularly
called the Ladrones.
The Caroline people and the Ladrone
people have been intermarried until
the two sets of islands are close kin.
The Ladrones are dark-colored, rather
small, and very shapely, with straight
hair, and, often, blue eyes. The Caro-
lineans are very tall, copper-colored,
curly-haired and black-eyed. The
blending of these two races has made
a generation of young people of al-
most a saffron tint, with wavy hair and
eyes of brown, hazel and blue; rather
pretty young people, you would say.
THE BEST REMEDY FOR RHEU-
MATISM. Quick Relief From Pain.
All who use Chamberlain's Pain
Balm for rheumatism are delighted
with the quick relief from pain which
it affords. When speaking of this Mr.
C. N. Slinki, of Troy, Ohio, says:
"Some time ago I had a severe attack
of rheumatism in my arm and shoul-
der. I tried numerous remedies but got
no relief until I was recommended by
Messrs. Geo. F. Parsons & Co. drug
gists of this place, to try Chamber-
lain's Pain Balm. They recommended
it so highly that I bought a bottle. I
was soon relieved of all pain. I have
since recommended this liniment to
many of my friends, who agree with me
that it is the best remedy for muscular
rheumatism in the market." For sale

IT IS A PARASITE.
That Causes Itching Scalp, Dandruff
and Finally, Falling Hair.
The itching scalp, the falling hair
and the dandruff that annoys are the
work of a parasite hidden in the scalp.
That parasite must be killed to cure
dandruff; and the only preparation
that will do that is Newbro's Herpicide.
"Destroy the cause, you remove the
effect."
C. H. Reed of Victor, Idaho, says:
"Myself and wife had dandruff and
falling hair several years. Two bottles
of Newbro's Herpicide completely
cured us, after several other hair
preparations had failed to do good."

The Cause of Many
Sudden Deaths.
There is a disease prevailing in this
country most dangerous because so decep
tive. Many sudden
deaths are caused by
silent heart disease.
Pneumonia, heart
failure or apoplexy
are often the result
of kidney disease. If
kidney trouble is al
lowed to advance the
kidney-poisoned
blood will attack the
vital organs or the
kidneys themselves breakdown and waste
away cell by cell.
Bladder troubles most always result from
derangement of the kidneys and a cure is
obtained quickest by a proper treatment of
the kidneys. If you are feeling badly you
can make no mistake by taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and
bladder remedy.
It corrects inability to hold urine and scald-
ing pain in passing it, and overcomes that
unpleasant necessity of being compelled to
go often during the day, and to get up many
times during the night. The mild and the
extraordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures of the most distressing cases.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and sold
by all druggists in fifty-cent and one-dollar
sized bottles. You may have a sample bottle of
this wonderful new discovery and a book that
tells all about it, both sample and book sent free by mail. Address Dr. Kilmer & Co.,
