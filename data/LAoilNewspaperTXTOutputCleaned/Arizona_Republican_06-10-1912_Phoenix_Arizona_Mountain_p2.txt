TEMPE

OIL OUTLOOK
IS BRIGHTER
Tempe Citizens Interested
in Tempe-Verde Com
pany Are Cheered by the
Increasingly Favorable
Reports of the Work.
Work on the Tempe Verde Oil com
pany’s well located in the Verde val
ley is progressing very satisfactorily
to all concerned and hopes of striking
oil are entertained. President C. G.
Jones of the company returned Fri
day night from the field where he
has been for the past three weeks,
and reports that the prospects could
not be better. Although the well is
only down eight hundred and fifty
feet at the present date a small
amount of oil has been discovered.
At each cleaning it is found quite
freely floating upon the surface of
the water.
The expert on the grounds predicts
a good flow by the time the well has
reached a depth of eleven or twelve
hundred feet, and judging from all
present indications his predictions are
very likely to come true.
L. V. Stewart, secretary for the lo
cal company, has taken Mr. Jones’
place of supervising the work at the
well as has been the custom since the
field was first located. One of the two
gentlemen has always been there.
Mr. Jones states that excitement in the
valley is still as intense as it was
when the first indications of oil pre
sented themselves. The valley is con
stantly building up and gives excel
lent prospects of being an exceedingly
well known place within the near
future.

THRESHERS AT WORK.
With the exception of one or two
every thresher within the vicinity of
Tempe is now at work in the fields.
C. H. Steele’s machine started in
Saturday on the home ranch in the
Kyrene district. Mahlon Brown will
start his machine in operation this
morning for the first time this sea
son. Four other threshers are at
work within close proximity of Tempe,
all reporting excellent progress. All
of the machines are turning out be
tween ten and twelve hundred sacks
a day. The Kyrene thresher will
start sometime within the next two
weeks if present arrangements carry
out.

Mrs. M. A. McLaughlin, 512 Jay
St., La Crosse, Wis., writes that she
suffered all kinds of pains in her
back and hips on account of kidney
trouble and rheumatism. “I got some
of Foley Kidney Pills and after tak
ing them for a few days there was a
wonderful change in my case, for the
pain entirely left my back and hips
and I am thankful there is such a
medicine as Foley Kidney Pills.” El
vey & Hulett.

Mrs. Lela Love, wife of Wiley Love,
a farmer living near Covina, Ga.,
says: “I have taken Foley Kidney
Pills and find them to be all you
claim for them. They gave me almost
instant relief when my kidneys were
sluggish and inactive. I can cheer
fully recommend them to all suffer
ers from kidney troubles.” Elvey &
Hulett.

Mrs. J. H. Wells and children will
leave tomorrow night for Los Ange

Clark.

VISITING FROM PHOENIX.
Clarence Clark, one time Tempe
boy but now employed in Phoenix,
spent yesterday here visiting relatives
and friends.

THEY PUT AN END TO IT.
Charles Sable, 58 Cook St., Roches
ter, N. Y., says he recommended Fo
ley Kidney Pills at every opportunity
because they gave him prompt relief
from a bad case of kidney trouble
that had long bothered him. Such a
recommendation, coming from Mr.
Sable, is direct and convincing evi
dence of the great curative qualities
of Foley Kidney Pills. Elvey & Hu
lett.

underway on his ranch for some time
past. He expects to have a baler at
work on his crop of alfalfa some
time this week, the crop being un
usually good considering it to be
the first ever grown on that land.

DEATH OF INFANT.
The three months’ old baby of Mr.
and Mrs. V. H. Stone, residents of
the Kyrene district, died Friday night
after suffering from a severe case of
whooping cough. The child was first
taken with the fatal cough at the
family home, but upon becoming sud
denly worse it was removed to town
where it might receive better medical
aid but the change made no im
pression on the child’s illness. It be
came constantly worse and died Fri
day evening. It was buried Saturday
afternoon at the Double Butte cem
etery.

Mrs. Wesley Hill and her sister,
Miss Ada Rosenberger, left Saturday

MESA
A WELCOME CHANGE
IN SUNDAY SERVICES
Since the beginning of warm weath
er, the pastors of the various Mesa
churches have been planning to hold
the interest of the public by varying
the Sunday services, providing some
thing new for both young and old.
They recognize the fact that during
the hot months it is hard for one to
concentrate the mind upon solemn
matters entirely, and new music, pic
tures and a general variety in church
services are necessary.
At the Methodist church last even
ing, Rev. David Roberts gave an il
lustrated lecture, providing magic lan
tern pictures of Bible scenes, with
views of the Holy Land, etc. The
change proved quite interesting to the
congregation and was instructive to
the younger people, to whom many
of the scenes were entirely new.
At the Baptist church, Rev. S. W.
Gage presided while the members of
his Sunday school gave a musical and
recitative program that was very in
teresting. The following numbers
were rendered:
Instrumental solo, Miss Wendell.
Opening chorus, Sunday school.
Exercise, “Talking Too Much,” by
four boys.
Recitation, “Work For Little Hands
To Do,” Gladys Clark.
Welcome song, Ethel Hines.
Recitation, “Would the World be
Better?” Idella Clark.
Recitation, “What Would I Do?”
Wallace Clark.
Duet, Misses Lulu Barkley and
Idella Clark.
Recitation, “The Rainbow,” Guy
Smith.
Recitation, “Livin’ for Virtue,”
Harold Wright.
Recitation, “Old Testament Rhymes,”
Ethel Hines.
Duet, Idella and Gladys Clark.
Song, Mrs. Barkley’s class.
Solo, Miss Flora Paxton.
Collection speech, Harold Viant.
Address by Sunday school superin
tendent, with a class exercise by
eleven boys and girls, on work of the
Baptist Publishing Society.
Offering.
Closing song, “God is on the Throne,”
by school.

LOST TWO COWS.
During the thunderstorm Friday,
Ephriam Base, living about two miles
southwest of Tempe, had the misfor
tune to lose two of his milk cows
which were struck by lightning and
instantly killed. One was the best
milch cow in the herd and the loss
will be quite a serious one.

ing for a day of rest and fishing.

evening.

NEW CLERK IN SADDLE.
Thomas Payton, the efficient town
clerk, newly elected, is now in full
charge of the clerical work of the
town. During the past week, the re
tiring clerk, Arthur A. Jones, turned
over all property and assisted Mr.
Payton in getting the routine of the
office under way. Mr. Jones left a
splendid set of books, up to date and
in perfect order. The business of the
town grew to several times its for
mer proportions during the four years
of Mr. Jones’ incumbency, but there
was a competent man in charge and
he kept fully up to all the work. No
town in Arizona had a better clerk
than Arthur Jones.

REMODELING PARLORS.
M. F. Holladay is busy remodeling
his ice cream and soda parlors and
will soon have one of the best in
the county. Mr. Holladay has been
in business in Mesa, off and on, for sev
eral years and always manages to
conduct a popular place. In addition
to his other business affairs he is
ranching and has a big lot of alfalfa
in storage sheds which will bring him
a fortune next winter.

HELPED TO KEEP DOWN EX
PENSES.
Mrs. J. E. Henry, Akron, Mich.,
tells how she did so: “I was bothered
with my kidneys and had to go nearly
double. I tried a sample of Foley
Kidney Pills and they did me so
much good that I bought a bottle
and feel that they saved me a big
doctor’s bill.” Elvey & Hulett.

THE DREAMER.
The dreamer dreamed and the busy
world
Passed by with a mocking smile,
As it went in search of the world’s
rewards,
But the dreamer dreamed the while.

He saw the world, as the world should
be
When longer years had run;
And the world but paused in its work
to ask:
“Pray, what has the dreamer done?”

But ever the dreamer dreamed his
dream
Until, in some wondrous way,
Like the water springing in deeps of
earth,
Finds passage to upper day.

The dreamer’s dream found the man
of power
(Strange how men’s lives are knit)
Who knew not the dreamer, but took
his dream
And transformed the world with it.

The world bows down to the man of
power;
Forgotten, the dreamer lies—
Yet the dream he dreamed is the se
cret force
That has forged men’s destinies.
—CHAS. BELLMAN.

“CHUG, CHUG, CHUG.”
Chug, chug, chug,
Goes the motor with
Fiendish glee,
And I would that my tongue could
utter
The phrases that rise in me!
O, well, the pedestrian hikes
For the sidewalk in horrid fright,
O, well, for the chicken and dog
That they scuttle away from sight!
But the autos still chug on,
At sixty miles an hour,
But O, for the sight of a cop who’d
get
The driver within his power!
Chug, chug, chug,
Goes the auto in fiendish glee,
But the life just snuffed from my
poodle pup
Will never come back to me!
—H. A. Brininstool, in Los Angeles
Express.
