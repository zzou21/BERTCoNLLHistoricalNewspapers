FINANCE AND
MARKETS
NEW YORK, July 28. Stocks drift
ed aimlessly and with many irregular
price changes after the strong open
ing of today's session, but hardened
again toward the close on renewed ab
sorption of equipments and steels.
Transactions were the smallest and
most contracted of any full day in
many weeks, falling considerably un
der the familiar million share level.
Equipments and steels derived their
main support from trade advices over
the week-end, which continued to re
port progress in those industries,
including another advance in the price
of wire products.
United States Steel fluctuated un
certainly after its strong opening, but
rallied from its partial setback in the
final dealings, in the belief that the
quarterly statement to be issued after
the close of tomorrow's market, is like
ly to show unmistakable improvement
over the previous exhibit.
Coppers were not especially con
spicuous at any period but other base
metals, notably American Zinc, were
strong.
Motors, oils and food shares reflected
the further confidence of pools, but
tobaccos were reactionary, also high
grade rails, although minor transporta
tions proved a partial offset. Sales,
850,000 shares.
Liberty bonds held steady and inter
nationals were firm, but the trend
otherwise was irregular. Total sales,
par value, $14,650,000. Old United States
bonds unchanged on call.

CURE SLICE TEA I
FADED OR GRAY HAIR
If Mixed With Sulphur It Darkens so
Naturally Nobody
Can Tell
Grandmother kept her hair beau
tifully darkened, glossy and attrac
tive with a brew of Sage Tea and
Sulphur. Whenever her hair took
on that dull, faded or streaked ap
pearance, this simple mixture was
applied with wonderful effect. By
asking at any drug store for
"Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Com
pound," you will get a large bottle
of this old-time recipe, improved by
the addition of other ingredients,
all ready to use, at very little cost.
This simple mixture can be de
pended upon to restore natural col
or and beauty to the hair.
A well known downtown druggist
says everybody uses Wyeth's Sage
and Sulphur Compound now be
cause it darkens so naturally and
evenly that nobody can tell it has
been applied; it's so easy to use,
too. You simply dampen a comb or
soft brush and draw it through
your hair, taking one strand at a
time. By morning the gray hair
disappears; after another applica
tion or two, it is restored to its nat
ural color and looks glossy, soft
and beautiful.
