SESSION LAWS
NOW ON SALE

Plain People Can Buy
More Statutory Provisions for $1.25 Than They
Can Live Up to the Rest
of Their Lives.

Two thousand copies of the laws of
the first state legislature, the product
of both sessions being bound in one
volume, have been printed and delivered to the secretary of state. Each
volume has 1132 pages and copies will
be sold to book lovers at $1.25 each.
They are bound in paper and the law
inside of them is guaranteed to be just
as good as though it were bound in
calf with morocco trimmings and gold
letters. Those who prefer copies bound
in leather may have them if they take
them to a bindery and have it done at
their own expense. The law provides
that only 20 copies shall be bound in
leather at the state's expense and these
shall be furnished to members of the
legislature and state officials designated. The secretary's office calls attention
to the indexing of the volume which
it regards as a little better job than
was ever turned out before in the publication of the Arizona statutes. It is
contended that a person of good ordinary intelligence can find what he is
looking for, if it is there, which has
not always been the case, unless the
seeker were an experienced lawyer,
skilled in searching for obscure statutes and legal provisions. The indexing was done by S. L. Pattee, on whom
will fall the duty also of codifying the

new laws and the old ones, so they
may be amalgamated into an Arizona
law book that will contain the whole
business, constitution, by-laws, apocalypse and concordance.
The journals of the legislature, it is
announced will be ready for distribution in about a week. Five hundred
copies of this important embalming of
legislative conduct have been ordered.

Joy at Hearing of a Battle Illustrated
With a Story

When the telegram from Cumberland
Gap informed Mr. Lincoln that "firing
was heard in the direction of Knox
ville" he remarked that he was glad
of it.
Governor Sprague had the perils of
Burnside's position uppermost in his
mind, and hearing the president's remark, asked Mr. Lincoln why he was
"glad of it".
"Why, you see, governor," responded
the president, "it reminds me of Mistress Sallie Ward, a neighbor of mine,
who had a very large family. Occasionally one of her numerous progeny
would be heard crying in some out-of-the-way
place, upon which Mistress
Sally would exclaim: 'There's one of
my children that isn't dead yet.'

New Corn Cure, Yet?

it.

The new law governing the use of
automobiles on the public highways,
will become effective on September 20.
It provides that every owner of a motor machine shall come across with a
piece of money for the road fund. The
motorcycles are let by for $2 annually,
the automobiles under 40 horsepower
can operate for $5 per annum and machines of larger size must be provided
for with a ten spot. In return for these
payments every applicant receives a
state number which must be attached
to his machine.
Gentlemen who drive their own machines have no further tax to pay but
every chauffeur who is a professional
or paid motor driver, must deposit $5
for a license, in return for which he
secures a badge that gives him the legal right to say he knows his business.
All these fees must be sent to the
secretary of state who hands out the
permits and passes the kale along to
the treasurer who drops it into the
road fund. Thus far about $500 has
been received by the secretary of state
who expects to take in between $15,000
and $20,000 more before the 20th of September, or it will be apparent the motorists of the state are not living up to
the law. After that date it will be the
duty of any peace officer in the state
to stop every driver who does not exhibit his state number on his machine,
and learn the reason why. It is likely
a great many know nothing about the
law and never will until some one taps
them on the shoulder, so it is presumed that officers will be reasonable
in the enforcement of the law at first,
or lenient until the violators have an
opportunity to make good. It is estimated that the revenue from this
source should be in the neighborhood
of $20,000 per annum, though the legislature assumed it would be considerably greater than that.
Licenses No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 were
issued to Dr. H. W. Fenner of Tucson,
Thos. Maddock of Williams and G. P.
Bullard of Phoenix, respectively. That
is the order in which applications were
filed with the secretary, just as soon
as the law was passed. Dr. Fenner was
the owner of the first auto in Arizona
and now has the first state license issued.

Mr. Maddock of Williams helped to
make the law. Mr. Bullard drafted it
after the California law and hoped to
be the owner of the first license but
the others beat him to it.

In respect of this law the question
has been asked, and is yet unanswered
whether one having a state license still
has to secure the city license and the
machine number of the town in which
he lives. Secretary Osborn says he
will pass that along to the attorney
general and the attorney general has
made no expression yet. It is certain
all will have to pay the state license
and use the state number. If the cities
also soak the motorists it will come a
little stiff on some of them and will
also give them a variety of numbers.

On the other hand, if the cities rescind
their licensing ordinances or if the
state law automatically rescinds them,
the cities will be deprived of a neat
sum of annual revenue they now enjoy.

WILCOX FAIR NEEDS

ONE MERRY-GO-ROUND

"GETS-IT Will 'Get' Every Corn
You've Got!"

At last, a real does-what-it-says
corn cure. Nothing like it has ever
before been known.

Every man and woman who has
corns, callouses, warts or bunions
ought to try "Gets-It" at once and
see how marvelously it works. Quit
shaving your corn with a razor. You
may draw blood and cause blood
poisoning.

"GETS-IT" is remarkable because
it never irritates or turns the true
flesh sore or raw. It can't. It is as
safe as water. Stockings won't stick
to it. Corns and callouses shrivel up,
come out. Blessed relief!
"GETS-IT" is sold at druggists at
25 cents a bottle, or sent on receipt
of price to E. Lawrence & Co., Chicago. Sold in Phoenix by A. L. Boeh-
pier; Owl Drug Co.; Puffin Drug Co.

Training of Kids for Sensations
Must Be Satisfied Inquiry
Sent to Phoenix

"Does anybody want to rent a
merry-go-round?"
Quoted from the letter of the secretary of the Willcox Fair. He says
any old kind of a whirligig will do,
just so long as it holds together long
enough to furnish amusement for a
fair-weekful of kids.
Suspecting some such article of
joy might be hidden or stored in
Phoenix, the Willcox man writes an
appeal to the board of trade to un-
earth the thing and consign it to
the nearest station, whence it can be
sent to the sensation-hungry boys
and girls of the speedy little burg.

Nothing definite can be learned
concerning the whereabouts of the
nearest merry-go-round. No Phoenix
citizen is suspected of harboring
such an apparatus. Still, Phoenix
wishes Willcox all kinds of luck in
its search, and hopes the secretary
will succeed in putting salt on the
tail of something big and daring for
the anxious youngsters.

In the far west the sun was rising.
On a road a spick-and-span wagon
with a white canvas cover pulled by
four sleek horses was jogging along,
the outfit glistening in the morning
rays, presenting a prosperous appearance unusual to that region. Henry
Hawkins, pioneer, drove, and within
the wagon his wife and their two little
children were sleeping soundly. Hawkins, who had a roving disposition,
having become dissatisfied with his
humdrum business in the east, had
sold out, put the money into a "schooner," horses, harness and general outfit and was going to "rush" for a new
home in a region that was about to be
opened to squatters.
Reaching the boundary, he found a
crowd of people waiting to take advantage of the same opportunity, which
was to occur the next day. Hawkins
made the effort with the rest, but he
was unfamiliar with the process, and
they all got ahead of him.

The sun stood at noon over another
scene. It was a region unrecognized
by the government and was consequently called No Man's Land. Hawkins wagon, paint worn and rickety,
was pulled along by three lean horses
over a dusty road, and, as before,
Hawkins drove. He had tired of trying to wrest a living from his unproductive farm, had pulled up stakes and
was going to find a new home in No
Man's Land.
He did not find a home to suit him.
Since the government did not recognize the existence of No Man's Land,
there was no law there, and the settlers concluded to govern themselves.
Hawkins, being the only man unoccupied, was appointed sheriff. One day
in trying to arrest a refractory citizen
Hawkins killed him. It was an unfortunate event for the sheriff. The man
who was killed had friends, and Hawkins was made to feel their enmity.
For years the Hawkins family hovered on the borders of those regions
that were about to be opened up, ready
to make a run for a home. But Hawkins either never succeeded in finding
one or if he did did not keep it. They
lived in the wagon and camped by the
roadside. The wagon was now old. It
had never been repainted, but it had
been patched. The horses were used
up; the canvas cover was rotten. The
wheels were held together by old pieces
of telegraph wire, the harness by bits
of rope. Hawkins with his broken
down team was known everywhere,
and he had acquired the name of "the
mover."
The sun was setting over the mountains. Two prospectors passing down
a dirt road saw a schooner, one wheel
of which had given way and let down
a corner of the wagon. This had effected a complete wreck. A man stood
looking at it mournfully. A woman
and two children were crying beside
a smoldering fire by the roadside.
"Do you know who that is?" said one
of the prospectors to the other. "That's
Hawkins, 'the mover.' Reckon he's
stranded at last. Hello, Hawkins!
What are you doing here?"
"Going to lay out a graveyard and
settle." was the mournful reply.

As he spoke the sun went down behind the mountains.

Five years passed. One morning a
horseman was riding on a road winding upward. A mechanic, with a bag
of tools slung over his shoulder, was
coming down. Just above a cloud of
smoke hung over a pocket in the mountain.

"To the president's house?" asked
the horseman, pointing ahead.
"Yes; up there where you see the
smoke."
"Has the new pump arrived?"
"Yes; this morning."

The horseman rode on, but before
coming to the smoke turned aside to a
roomy and comfortable-looking dwelling set in the center of well-adorned
grounds. Dismounting at the gateway,
he went up to the house. Of the servant who came to the door he asked:
"Is the president at home or over
there?" pointing.
"He's just going over, sir. He'll be
down in a minute."

The president came down, and the
stranger said to him:
"I'm Ingleside: sent out to put in the
new pump."
"Ah, glad to see you. We'll go over."
Mr. Ingleside was invited to take up
his quarters at the house, and that
evening while the two sat smoking together he asked the president how he
came to select the name given his
mine.
"Mines," replied the president, "are
the result of luck in most cases, and
often their names are derived from
some incident leading to their discovery. During my early residence in the
west I lived in a wagon. One night my
wagon collapsed right over there in
the pocket. A man came along and
asked what I was doing there. Completely discouraged, I replied that I
was going to lay out a graveyard and
settle. Half an hour afterward I
picked up a piece of quartz with so
much gold in it that even I, inexperienced in such matters as I then was,
saw it was a rich nugget. That led
to the mine, and I called it the 'Graveyard mine.' The day I struck the nugget I was Hawkins, 'the mover,' now I
am Henry Hawkins, president of the
Graveyard mine.

Is Finally Settled; Phoenix
and Roosevelt Dam Occupy Prominent Positions
on Time Card of Distinguished Tourists.
Phoenix has at last been definitely
placed on the route of the American
Geographic Society's excursion this
fall. From time to time there have arrived at the board of trade, letters
and lists, showing the progress of the
plans for the big tour of America to
be made by the members of the society and their guests, scientists and
savants from nearly every country
of Europe.

The train with its load of wisdom
leaves New York City early in September and for a solid month traces
a line of erudition about the places
of interest in the United States.
Stops are scheduled at all places of
natural and industrial fame. Arizona
will represent stupendous examples of
both. The Grand Canyon is the very
biggest piece of scenery in the world,
and the Roosevelt dam is not the biggest pile of stone accumulated by
human hands, is one of the most valuable to the race.
Accommodations on the excursion
train will be of the best. A baggage
car will carry the duffle, a diner will
provide for the comfort of the inner
man, for even high-browed professors
of L. L. D., M. D., etc., must eat.
Four sleepers will contain berths for
ninety men, but it is thought there
will not be more than seventy or
eighty members on board at one time.
Not all the American members will
make all the trip, some joining for a
few hundred miles, "here and there,
and similar depletions in the ranks
occurring now and then. The observation car will enable thirty to watch
the passing landscape.
W. M. Davis, member of the American Geographic Society is appointed
director of the excursion. His assistant will be W. L. G. Joerg, Mark
Jefferson, R. K. Dodge and I. Bowman are marshals. The annals of the
journey will be compiled and kept by
A. P. Brigham. Dr. Frank S.
Churchill of New York City will care
for the sick. N. M. Finneman is the
journalist, and Lawrence Martin, editor of the 'Daily Bulletin," a unique
little publication to be issued every
day from the private press on board
the train. There are various other
officials of more or less importance
and dignity. They all have their
duties outlined, and when working together, promise a great time for the
members and their distinguished
guests.

The excursion penetrates the Great
Southwest at Raton, New Mexico. On
Monday, September 30, they arrive at
Santa Fe, capital of the sister state.
From that interesting old place they
are scheduled for several local excursions among the ruined pueblos
and cave dwellings. Next day they
take in the Petrified Forest. That
same night they arrive at El Tovar,
the Grand Canyon. A day will be devoted to searching out the trails to
the bottom of the gigantic crack, then
a day to rest.
The train arrives in Phoenix at
8:30 in the morning of October 4, and
the party leaves immediately by auto
for Roosevelt. Harry Welch at the
board of trade arranges the trip, and
Manager Wayland Wood of the Arizona Motor Company the Studebaker
cars, in which the ride is to be
made.
Entertained at the dam overnight,
the party makes the return Saturday
in time to catch the train north at
5 p. m.

hands of the clock crawled around
to 4:30, Senator Gallinger, in the
chair, arose and declared the session
adjourned sine die, and the senators
wandered out of the chamber.
After recessing from 2:23 to 3:23
the house transacted little business.
It passed a bill of Representative
Carlin of Virginia, Democrat, fixing
penalties for breaking seals on cars
in interstate commerce, and adopted
the concurrent resolution on adjournment, and then blocked all
other attempts at legislation. A

to speak to me before going to Washington. I told him to go ahead and
testify to everything he could remember. I told him that if I were absent
from Sagamore Hill he could come,
get my letter books, take from them
any letters he wanted and place them
before the committee."

Roosevelt chuckled as he read the
newspaper stories. He stopped abruptly in the reading and looked up
at the correspondents.
"I could thank Penrose and Arch
bold for what they have done for me,"
he said. "They have rendered me a
real service."
One of the correspondents told Mr.
Roosevelt that Governor Hadley, of
Missouri, had given an interview in
his defense today.
"Bully, good for Hadley," was all
he said.
There is one thing that Roosevelt
asks the correspondents to make clear
each time they visit him. That is,
he does not say the Standard Oil did
not contribute $100,000 to his campaign fund in 1904, but that he does
not know of any such contribution and
that if it was given, his campaign
managers received it in violation of
his explicit instructions.
The letter which Roosevelt is waiting to send to Senator Clapp, chairman of the
senate committee, was not finished tonight and he said he did not know
when it would be done. It will be a
long one, he added, as he is trying
to embody in it the principal things to
which he would have testified had he
had an opportunity to appear today
before the committee.
