FINANCIAL AND MARKET NEWS

Day’s Review of
the New York
Stock Market
[Republican A. P. Leased Wire]
NEW YORK, April 8—Week-end
operations on the stock exchange
closed very as they began—in
a whirl of speculative enthusiasm
and many new high records for the
sustained movement.
Early dealings were irregular in
consequence of further realizing
sales. These effected reversals of
one to four points among Studebaker
and Chandler Motors, General Elec
tric, Baldwin Locomotive, Mexican
Petroleum and Electric Storage Bat
tery.
Prices soon rallied, however, on re
newed buying of independent steels
under lead of Gulf States, yesterday's
sensational performer, as well as
Bethlehem, Midvale, Republic and
Sloss-Sheffield.
Local utilities also strengthened
their position on the outcome of the
Interborough Rapid Transit situation
and additional accumulation of rails
proceeded, mainly in Reading, Balti
more and Ohio, Missouri Pacific com
mon and preferred and other low
grade issues.
Shorts experienced another uncom
fortable time in their efforts to de
press the oils, that division resisting
pressure and adding substantially to
the many net gains at the very active
finish. Sales amounted to 835,000
shares, a record for any two hour ses
sion since 1919.
Excepting German marks, which
raised a trifle, all the foreign ex
changes displayed a strong tone.
Sterling’s rise to 4.41 for demand bill
represented the highest quotation for
that remittance since the early part
of last March. Allied and Scandi
navian bills gained 2 to 12 points and
the Montreal discount here continued
to ease.
Despite the extraordinary activity in
the stock market and the resultant
demand for funds, clearing house
loans and discounts showed an actual
decrease of slightly more than $8,100,000 and a moderate gain in cash
increased actual excess reserves to
about $14,660,000.
WEEKLY FINANCIAL
NEW YORK, April 8—Dealings in
volved no less than 7,000,000 shares,
mostly at highest prices for the year
or a much longer period, and a cor
responding degree of activity and
strength in the bond list, epitomized
a noteworthy week in the securities
market.
Factors on which the broad foun
dation of bullish enthusiasm seem to
be laid, notably the marked improve
ment in general economic, financial
and industrial conditions, are now so
widely recognized, even in conserva
tive circles, as to occasion little doubt
or discussion. Almost the only cloud
on the financial horizon was the sus
pension of operations in the coal
fields but the strength of coal shares
almost collectively, brought to mind
a time worn tradition that 'Wall
Street never sells on a strike.'
Many other railway shares besides
the anthracite and bituminous is
sues gave impressive demonstrations
of strength, but speculative interest
was most keen in steels, oils, motors
and equipment.
From these groups activity extend
ed to shipping, coppers, rubber and
textiles, most of which derived their
strength from the better market po
sition of those commodities, while
food specialties reflected the further
advance of farm products.
A few special stocks reacted to
poor statements of earnings and
more or less vulnerable technical por
tion, but the movement of the great
mass of industrials seemed to be
based on indubitable evidence of
trade revival and cheap money.
Call loans in the open market were
at 4 1/4 per cent, but many private
loans were made at 4 per cent on
gilt-edged collateral. The same dis
parity applied to time funds, accom
modations for the longest dates
being privately offered at a conces
sion from the 4% per cent quotation.
England’s notice to her erstwhile
allies for payment of interest on war
advances threatened renewed unset
tlement in foreign exchanges.
WEEKLY METAL
NEW YORK, April 8—The buying
movement in steel continues. In
consequence, prices are stiffening and
a feature of the week has been an
advance of $3 a ton in spots by a
leading manufacturer.
The steady increase in production
of pig iron is the best evidence of
the improved demand and some man
ufacturers are less disposed to book
ahead.
In coppers a steadier tone has de
veloped. Buyers showed increased
interest at the recent decline and
small lots pressing for sale at con
cessions from the 12% per cent level ap
peared to have been either absorbed
or withdrawn by the end of the week.
It is now estimated that last
month's sales for home con
sumption and export totalled nearly
200,000,000 pounds.
Electrolytic is still said to be avail
able around the 12% per cent level
for spot or prompt shipment, but
some of the larger producers are ask
ing advances of % to % cent for for
ward deliveries.
Lead remains very firm with a
good general demand. Offerings for
the current month are light.
Zinc is also firm and higher with
a continued good consuming demand
for the second quarter, reflecting the
activity in steel circles. Antimony is
firm with a fair demand and light
offerings. All of the weak holdings
seem to have been liquidated.
CHICAGO BOARD
CHICAGO, April 8—Wheat ad
vanced sharply today, following a
weak start, the July option touching
a new high mark for the week
when $1.2074 was attained shortly be
fore the close. Buying by houses
with western connections was main
ly responsible for the quick upward
turn, and as the finish, which was
strong, the market allowed a net
gain of % to 1% cents, with May at
$1.32% to $1.32%, and July $1.20% to
$1.20%. Corn closed % to % cent
higher; oats were up % to % cents
and provisions showed an advance
ranging from 7 to 50 cents.
While the government crop report
on winter wheat, issued after yester
day's close, instilled a slightly bear
ish tinge to the market at the open
ing, this was short lived, however, as
the buying demand from the eastern
houses caused a reaction which sent
prices to higher levels. Unfavorable
reports regarding the crop in the
southwest also was a contributing
factor.
Corn and oats reflected the action
in wheat. There was a broader trade
and commission house buying led to
considerable short covering. There
was little, however, in the news on
corn to attract attention, but the day
in oats caused increased apprehen
sion.
Provisions, while rather dull, av
eraged higher in sympathy with hogs
and grain.

CHANDLER WINNER
OVER PRESCOTT IN
DEBATING CONTEST
CHANDLER, April 8—The Chandler
debating team contested the
Prescott team in the third debate
held in Chandler last Friday night.
The Chandler team consisting of Wm.
Campbell and Floyd Holdren won the
unanimous decision of the judges.
The Prescott team was composed of
two high school girls, Miss Eleanor
Cotton and Miss Dorothy Stuart who
did exceedingly well and gave the
local boys a good run for the deci
sion. The coach of the Prescott team
is Miss Frances Keene; from the abil
ity shown by the two young ladies,
she has been doing some splendid
work.
The judges were the Rev. W. I.
Brooks, assistant pastor of the First
Presbyterian church of Phoenix; Mel
Fickas and Mr. Peek of Peek and
Fleming cotton buyers also of Phoe
nix.
The Chandler team has won three
unanimous decisions, one on the af
firmative side of the question and
two on the negative. They had the
negative Friday night.
The subject debated was, “Res
olved: That further legislation to
restrict immigration into the United
States would be injurious to the in
dustrial development of the country.”
Free Lecture Monday Night
The Christian Science society of
Chandler announces that a free lec
ture will be given in Menhenett

ver, Colo. Mr. Palmer is a member
of the board of lectureship of the
mother church, The First Church of
Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Mass.

free lecture and that the public is
cordially invited.

gins of Phoenix began shipping in
new fixtures for another shop in the
same building. This shop will be
open for business in every way next
Monday.

property and will move his family
here right away.
Lodges Take New Hall
The Odd Fellows and K. P’s. have
gone into a joint contract and leased
the lodge room prepared for them by
the Chandler Improvement company
recently in the Monroe building. This

week.

inal count. D. L. Stapley, seventh

Five Figure In Accident
Wendell Cluff received two deep
gashes in his arm and four other
Mesa High school students were con
siderably shaken up in an auto
accident that happened on the main
street in Mesa Saturday afternoon at
5 o'clock. A Ford car driven by Olive
Drew and carrying as passengers
Turner Hurst, Ruth Gollaher, Delbert
Cluff and Wendell Cluff was pro
ceeding west on Main street when a
larger car coming out of a parking
space opposite the O. S. Stapley com
pany store, obstructed their progress.
Both cars swerved apart, but struck
each other, and in the crash the
younger Cluff and Miss Gollaher were
thrown to the ground. Glass was
shattered and two gashes were cut in
Cluff's arm, necessitating a number of
stitches.
The accident quickly attracted an
excited crowd and one of the mem
bers of the party was so badly
frightened that she went into hys
terics. Dr. Palmer was called and
the injured ones were taken to his
office where attention was given.
Both of the cars were slightly
damaged in the collision. The larger
machine swerving back into the
parking space struck another car
but no material damage was done.
Two Stills Captured
M. M. Humphries was arrested
south of Chandler Friday evening and
a still which he was alleged to have
operated was taken by the officers.

forenoon on the desert east of Mesa
and Jack Wells was taken into
custody on a charge of having oper
ated it.

til very recently lived on a ranch east

Junior Class Play Great Success
On Thursday evening, April 6, the
Junior class of the Tempe Normal
gave the annual Junior play to a
large audience in the Normal audi
torium. The testimony of the audi
ence indicates that the performance
ranks as one of the best ever given
by local talent from the Normal plat
form.
The play chosen for this year's
presentation was Booth Tarkington’s
comedy, "Clarence." It was present
ed under the direction of Prof. Geo.
M. Frizzell, who is especially suc
cessful in this line of work. Much
credit is due Mr. Frizzell as well as
the all-star cast who acted their
parts so splendidly.
Each of the players took his or her
part so well that it seems an injustice
to make special mention of individuals.
The audience greeted the players with
applause and laughter that began at
the rise of the curtain and continued
until the fall of the curtain in the
last act.
