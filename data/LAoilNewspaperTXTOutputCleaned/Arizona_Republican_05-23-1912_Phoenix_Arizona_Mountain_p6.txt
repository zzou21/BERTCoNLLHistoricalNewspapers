FROM PRESCOTT
PRESCOTT — J. E. Russell was a guest at the Hotel Adams.

COMING OFF Lids are coming off the various picture and
vaudeville theaters in anticipation of
the summer out of door season.

PRESCOTT ATTORNEY T. G.
Norris, the well known Prescott attor-
ney was in Phoenix yesterday on
professional business, and a guest at
the Adams. M. D. Hazeltine, another
prominent Prescottrian was also here
during the day.

ARMY IN EVIDENCE The Sal-
vation Army was much in evidence
last evening on the City Hall plaza
where the army entertained hundreds
of its friends with speaking and a
concert by the Leydas orchestra which
played an especially attractive pro-
gram.

NO NUMBERS NO WATER The
patience and good nature of officials
of the water department is exhausted
and an order has gone forth that
hereafter houses which are not prop-
erly numbered will be denied service.
There are many residences in Phoe-
nix without street numbers displayed
and this results in great annoyance
and delay to the department which is
forced to spend much time in run-
ning down addresses. There is a city
ordinance requiring the numbering of
every house within the city limits,
and it is now the intention to see
that this ordinance is rigidly en-
forced. Patrons of the department
living beyond the limits must also
provide their places of residence with
either a number or a name so that
there will be no confusion on the
records of the department.

STREET CAR STOPS Chief of
Police Moore has decided that street
cars are as amenable to traffic regu-
lations as vehicles which are not
confined to rails, and has notified
the traffic squad that all cars ap-
proaching the intersection of Central
avenue and Washington street must
stop inside the crossing line on the
"near" or approaching side of the
street and not stop back even a little
bit, into the intersection proper.
President Mitchell of the street car
company, is said to sanction this ar-
rangement. The motorman who
transgresses the rule will be warned
once and escorted to the "carpet" at
police headquarters for a second of-
fense. Another traffic regulation re-
quires the seeker after knowledge to
accost the sidewalk patrolmen and
not disturb the squad busy directing
the flow of traffic from his platform
in the center of the thoroughfares.

DIVORCE CASE FILED Mary V.
J. Ruck appeals to the superior court
to dissolve the marital bonds which
bind her to Carl Udell Ruck, whom
she accuses in her complaint filed
yesterday, of improper conduct.

TRIP TO BUCKEYE Chairman of
the board of supervisors W. A. Monee,
Clerk of the Board Miller, and Archi-
tect Royal Lescher went to Buckeye
yesterday to inspect the foundation
work for the new $5000 jail which
the county is building at that place.

PLEADED GUILTY J. Valencia
pleaded guilty in superior court yes-
terday to an assault upon his wife
with a deadly weapon—a knife—as a
result of which the woman was seri-
ously injured. Valencia will receive
his sentence this morning. The bal-
ance of the day in this court was
occupied with the trial of civil cases.

INDIAN HELD James Matthews,
an Indian, was arraigned by United
States Commissioner C. W. Johnstone
yesterday and held for the federal
grand jury on a charge of giving
liquor to other Indians. Matthews is
alleged to have bought the drink
from a Mexican who is already in
custody and then to have divided his
acquisition with two Pimas.

GONE TO HOLBROOK Sidney
Osborn, secretary of state, expected
to be joined here last night by Judge
F. J. Duffy of Santa Cruz county
when both planned to leave on a
north bound train for Holbrook where
Judge Duffy will preside in the con-
tested election case between the re-
publican and democratic candidates
for superior judge at the last elec-
tion. Mr. Osborn figures as a witness
and the custodian of the ballots
which are in the safeguarding of the
secretary and which will probably be
viewed by the court.

LOS ANGELES VISITORS Mr.
and Mrs. C. C. Boyer of Los Angeles
are Phoenix visitors and guests at
the Hotel Adams.

ON VACATION Assistant City
Engineer L. M. Hoimquist left last
night for Weldon, Illinois, where he
will visit for a month.

HOTEL GUESTS Charles Boyer,
of the Western Telegraph company,
is in Phoenix transacting commercial
and official business. Mr. Boyer is
agent of the Western Telegraph com-
pany for the Southwestern district
including California, Arizona and
southern Nevada. He is looking over
this part of his field with a view to
studying the company’s needs.

AN ALLEGED NUISANCE J. H.
Mulrein believes in laundries all
right, but he thinks they should be
operated during ordinary working
hours and not extend their efforts
into the brief cuckoos of the early
morning hours. Mulrein accordingly
has begun an action in police court
against one Ah Sam, protesting
against the active wakefulness of Ah
Sam’s West Washington street wash-
shop. The case will be heard by
Judge Thomas whose judicial
acumen will be called into play to determine
"when is a laundry?" P. S. It is al-
leged that Ah Sam is a Chinaman.

"BILLY" REMEMBERED "Billy"
Wilson, bailiff in Judge Phillips’
court, and attaché of the sheriff’s
office, was haled into court together
with the recently acquired Mrs. Wil-
son who came all the way from Ari-
zona to marry Billy. In the courtroom
nearly a hundred friends of the pop-
ular officer were assembled and in a
few eloquent passages of verbal
effusery Vernon Clark presented the
happy couple with a silver token of
the esteem in which they are held.
The gift is a card receiver, and was
received with a characteristic speech
of appreciation from Billy. It was
suggested that if he does not play
cards any number of folks can be
found who will elucidate for him the
difference between a full house and
a locomotive headlight.

FILING OF PETITIONS Before
The Republican had circulated many
hours yesterday morning three peti-
tions for charter commission had
been taken from the office of the city
recorder and started upon their
rounds. Until this paper called at-
tention to the few remaining days in
which nominations might be filed
there was no general realization of
the peril of permitting the election
of June sixth to go by default. All
nominating papers must be in by
Saturday to secure a place upon the
official ballot, and it is now assured
that there will be at least three
tickets. E. S. Godfrey has the peti-
tion for the fourteen candidates
recommended by the unofficial char-
ter commission, comprising half of the
membership of that organization. J.
I. Martin is out with a petition
upon which he will secure the neces-
sary signatures for four or five rep-
resentatives of the socialist party.
Another petition is also being circu-
lated by the labor party.

MARKING TIME Deputy United
States Marshal Bush Anderson is
marking time preparatory to starting
for the federal prison at Atlanta,
Georgia, next Sunday when he will
convey six prisoners found guilty of
various crimes against the govern-
ment and sentenced by the district
court to terms varying in length
from a year and a day to seven
years. A. R. Volk and Malin Lewis,
of Phoenix; Frank Siden, of Flor-
ence; John Lintell, of Prescott, and
one other not yet named will ac-
company the party as guards. One
of the candidates for punishment is
John Carroll, the Maricopa county
defendant who was found guilty of
passing counterfeit coin and sen-
tenced to a three-year term. The
others are in the Tucson jail. The
start will be made at noon Sunday
from Phoenix and from Tucson on the
following morning. During the four
day journey the guard will be divided
into three watches, two men being
constantly on guard. The prisoners
will travel in a chair car. Messrs.
Volk and Lewis will be joined in the
east by their wives and will tour the
states returning by way of Chicago
where they will attend the repub-
lican national convention.

menced work yesterday on South
Second avenue between Washington
and Jefferson streets which is to re-
ceive the attention of the paving
brigade at an early date.

QUARTERLY EXAMINATION
The quarterly examination of appli-
cants for certificates to high school
will be held in the various counties
June 5 and 6. The state board of
examiners is now busily preparing
the questions that will be submitted
for the embarrassment of the appli-
cants.

NEW SCHOOL DISTRICT A new
school district is needed in rapidly
developing section north of the pres-
ent Washington district. There are
seven children of school age in the
proposed new district some of whom
now have to go as far as six miles
to the Washington school. The resi-
dents offer to provide all the
necessary building, and County Super-
intendent of Schools J. A. Ricks,
who has carefully investigated the
matter, will recommend to the board
of supervisors the creation of the
district. If the recommendation is ac-
cepted as it doubtless will be, the
new building will be erected during
the summer and be ready for the as-
signment of a teacher and the start-
ing of class work in the fall.

CASE DISMISSED Judge Phillips
yesterday entered an order of dismis-
sal in the case of the George Hageman
company against A. R. Volk. This
case has been pending since last Nov-
ember and involved several unique
points in the mechanic's lien law.
Struckmeyer and Fisher appeared for
the defendant and I. Marks for the
plaintiff company.

MILITARY DRILL A feature of the
commencement exercises at the In-
dian school yesterday was the military
drill participated in by nearly every
student at the school. Under the able
direction of Major Grinstead the
scholars showed remarkable skill and
the two youngest classes carried away
the honors. A large crowd of interest-
ed citizens saw the drill which was re-
viewed by Governor Hunt and a num-
ber of National Guard and army of-
ficers. The commencement program for
today includes a baseball game at
nine o’clock this morning, a returned
students’ conference this afternoon and
a band concert and returned students’
social in the evening. The festivities
will end tomorrow with field day ex-
ercises at 10 a. m. and band concert
and commencement exercises in the eve-
ning at which function Governor
Hunt will present the diplomas to the
graduating class numbering fourteen
students.

POINTERS FOR the MOTORIST
FACTS ABOUT THE CARE
OF RIMS.
Just now at the beginning of the
season when motorists are again
taking their cars out on the road,
many automobiles are being examined
with critical eye to detect any trouble
that may have been brought on by the
long winter's rest.
One of the things which should be
examined into is the condition of the
rims. It may seem like a small thing,
yet rust which is likely to collect on
rims during the months of idleness is
a real danger.
Rust can always be detected by the
appearance of the beads of the envel-
ope. When the beads show strongly
marked yellowish stain it is evident
that the tire has not been properly
cared for. This stain is nothing else
than rust which forms on the rims and
is deposited on the beads of the tire.
If it is allowed to remain it will de-
stroy the tire, for it will slowly but
surely eat away the fabric. Moreover,
the edges of rusted rims will become
more uneven every day.
Further, when a rim is rusted it is
impossible to maintain the close and
regular contact which should exist be-
tween rim and bead. Water will soon
find its way into the tire to work its
usual harm.
After having been out in bad weath-
er, if the motorist is careful to sponge
tires and rims clean and then wipe
them dry, especially along the beads,
he will do much to prevent the forma-
tion of rust. It is possible, however,
that in spite of the exercise of reason-
able care the rims may suffer a lit-
tle damage, especially during the win-
ter. In any case it is advisable to ex-
amine the rims closely from time to
time.
Many suggestions on the proper care
of tires, tubes and rims are instruc-
tively discussed in the two books "Mi-
chelin" issued by the Michelin Tire
Company, of Milltown, New Jersey.
Copies will be mailed free to motorists
on request.
