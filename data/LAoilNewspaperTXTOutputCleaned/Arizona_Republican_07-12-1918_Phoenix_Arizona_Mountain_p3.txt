COURT RULING
OF TREATMENT TO
COURT BRINGS

Claiming that he did not think the
court was giving him a fair deal, Hu
bert Clark, chief counsel for Ival Mc
Cann, charged with the murder of
Kenneth C. Folston, yesterday com
plained of the court's ruling in the
case now on trial.

Admonished to make no more such
remarks or he would be punished for
contempt, Clark replied that if he said
anything out of the way, he would
apologize but that he was no novice
at the game as this was his fifteenth
murder trial. He insisted that his ques
tion to which the county attorney had
objection, the court holding with the
state, was proper.

Judge Crosby stated he had ruled
and ordered the case to proceed.

The most important court ruling
made during the day came shortly af
ter the noon hour when the motion for
an instructed verdict, made by coun
sel for the defense after the state had
rested its case, was denied. Clark based
his motion primarily on the ground
that the prosecution had not suffi
ciently shown corpus delicti, as no evi
dence had been introduced to show
that death was caused by other than
natural causes.

In denying the motion, the court
stated that the corpus delicti had been
sufficiently shown by circumstantial
evidence and that without giving fur
ther reason the motion for an in
structed verdict would be denied.

The jury was dismissed while the
motion was being argued and after the
ruling the defense took up its case,
calling several witnesses to the stand
before the afternoon recess. The argu
ments were lengthy on the part of
counsel for the defense who gave nine
reasons for asking for an instructed
verdict:

(1) That the state has not proven
facts sufficient against the defendant
to warrant the submission of any issue
of guilt or innocence of the defendant
to the jury.

(2) The corpus delicti has not been
established by the state beyond a reas
onable doubt or in accordance with the
law sufficient to warrant the consid
eration of any evidence against the de
fendant.

(3) The corpus delicti has not been
established by any evidence sufficient
to warrant submission to the jury.

(4) That the photograph introduced
as the photograph of the deceased and
upon which all evidence as to the iden
tity of the deceased was based was
not sufficiently proven and qualified
as a likeness and correct representa
tion of said deceased.

(5) That the death of the supposed
deceased has not been sufficiently es
tablished as required by law.

(6) That the death of the deceased
by criminal agency has not been estab
lished by evidence sufficient to war
rant submission to the jury or the
consideration of any evidence as to the
acts or agency of defendant.

(7) That the evidence does not
show the criminal agency of the de
fendant in the premises sufficient to
warrant submission to the jury.

(8) That there is no proof by the
state that the defendant killed Ken
neth C. Folston which is sufficient to
warrant any verdict other than that of
not guilty.

(9) That there is no evidence pre
sented that excludes a reasonable hy
pothesis that the deceased came to his
death through suicide, natural death,
no criminal or other agency or means
other than through the defendant, or
in some other manner.

County Attorney L. M. Laney rested
his case shortly after the opening of
the morning session. The first wit
ness called to the stand was W. R.
Price, secretary of the Phoenix fire
department, who testified as to the
date of a fire at the mattress factory,
on West Washington street near
which Kenneth C. Folston and Mc
Cann were alleged to have been seen
before 9 o'clock on the morning of
November 13. Price stated that the
fire was on the nineteenth and that
the alarm had been turned in at 8:55
o'clock.

The county attorney then took the
stand and identified the three bullets
taken from the dried-up brain tissue
of Folston when the examination
was conducted at the Merryman un
dertaking rooms. Laney testified that
the bullets had been in his exclusive
keeping since that time.

Ben Folston, the murdered man's
brother, was the last witness for the
state, it being the fourth time he was
recalled to the stand. He testified
that his brother carried his money in
his right hip pocket, it having pre
viously been shown that this pocket
was turned inside out when the
body was found in the mountain wash
near Scottsdale.

Clark attempted to question Fol
ston relative to his being administrat
or of his brother's estate, but when
objection was offered to his using
Folston as his own witness at this
time, Clark replied, "I think you are
right as I do not want to introduce
any evidence." It was then he asked
the court to excuse the jury and after
this was accomplished the motion
for an instructed verdict was filed
and argued.

Before taking up his case the de
fense called for L. C. Sowell who, un
der oath, testified that J. A. Bruce,
the Thiel detective in the case, and
Jack Smith had attempted to ques
tion him relative to the case al
though he had been placed under rule.
Mr. Bruce, who has been exempt
from the rule, stepped in the court
room at that moment and explained
that the first thing he asked Sowell
when he went to his house Wednes
day night was whether or not he had
been sworn. He said no. Later,
"I started to ask him a question and
he said he did not know whether he
should discuss it and I learned that
he had been placed under the rule,"
said Bruce who stated that Sowell
was a trifle deaf and had probably
not understood him when he first put
the question. They had no further
conversation about the case.

J. M. Creighton was the first wit
ness for the defense. Mr. Creighton
identified the blue print he had made
of the spot where the body was
found.
Sowell was next called to testify.
He had accompanied Creighton, the
defendant and counsel to the spot
sketched by the former and his testi
mony had to do with the blue print.
Mrs. Cleo Prince, proprietress of
the Alturas rooming house where
Folston had a cot was questioned as
to dates relative to the time Folston
registered there. It was in his man
ner of asking what were ruled irrele
vant questions to this witness that
brought about the promise for con
tempt proceedings if it continued.
"Oh well if that is the court's rul
ing I don't think the court is giving
me a square deal," said the attorney.
Nick Annis, who sold the Buick car
to Folston, was regarded by the state
as a witness for them as Annis tes
tified as to the tires on the car
which bore out the tracks made in
the vicinity of the desert where Fol
ston's coat, muffler and handkerchief
were found.
Lyman La Tourette, under-sheriff,
testified that McCann had notified
the sheriff's office of the disappear
ance of Folston.

Court adjourned at an earlier hour
than usual to give counsel for the de
fense time to procure additional wit
nesses. The morning session has
been called for 9:30 o'clock.

NEW ADJUSTMENT OF
WHEAT RULE
TO BE
ANNOUNCED SOON

The first intimation of an adjustment
of the wheat conservation program of
the food administration to conform
with improved crop prospects was re
ceived yesterday by Timothy A. Rior
dan, federal food administrator for
Arizona, in the form of a telegram from
the food administration, Washington.
This telegram revokes the so-called
70 per cent rule, which has limited the
sale of wheat by millers, wholesalers
and jobbers to 70 per cent of their cus
tomers' requirements, as based on their
purchases last year.
Whether the present excellent crop
prospects will justify increasing the
consumption of wheat products by in
dividuals, now limited to six pounds
per month, is still problematical.
Even though the coming harvest
should prove as bounteous as it prom
ises at this time, the food administra
tion officials point out, there is strong
necessity for reserve stocks. This is
a statement given out by the United
States food administration:
"With the present prospects of a
very large wheat crop and with
greatly increased acreage and favor
able conditions of all other cereals,
America has perhaps reached its high
water mark agriculturally during the
war and is in a position to store up
reserves against the time when many
men now engaged in farming will be
needed for the army and for other war
work.

"The importance of this reserve is
indicated by every cable received
from Great Britain and France, where
reserves have been below the danger
point for the last year. With this de
mand upon it, it is impossible for the
United States, even in the face of good
crops, to relax to any extent our meas
ures of food conservation.

"With the coming of the 1918 har
vests our hope is to build up abroad as
large reserves of food as possible. This
does not necessarily mean immediate
large increases in consumption, but it
does mean that the morale of France,
England and Italy will be supported by
the knowledge that in our own country
sufficient stores of food exist to meet
all contingencies."

ROMANCE FINDS ITS
CULMINATION HERE

Winning the love of Tilden P. Cop
ening, a mining man of Casa Grande,
when she gave him information he
desired relative to the mailing regula
tions, Miss Tula L. Humphreys, post
mistress of the town, found that after
all her business was not the only
thing in life.

For five years Miss Humphreys held
the federal position. She was devoted
to her work which she carried on con
scientiously. Then she met the min
ing man and told him she was motor
ing to the coast with her parents. He
was one of the party arriving here
yesterday and when he arrived per
suaded Miss Humphreys to accom
pany him to the office of the clerk of
the court where a marriage license
was procured.

The couple were married at 8 o'clock
last evening by Rev. J. A. Wailes of
the Central Methodist church. They
will leave today with the bride's par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. A. Humphreys, on
an overland trip to the coast.

The Humphreys formerly lived in
Glendale where the bride of yesterday
attended school.

THIRD SON
TO SERVE
NATION

one of the superior court, yesterday
gave his third son, a lad of 15, to the

ham in the navy in Globe, Mr. Gra
ham gave a patriotic American boy to
do his bit for the great war for de
mocracy. His two other sons are in

smith shop and Corporal Earl Gra
ham of 340th F. A. arrived recently
