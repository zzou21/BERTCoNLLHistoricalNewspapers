STILL UNDOUBTED.
The Report of the Sinking
of the Itata
Not Yet Contradicted by the
Authorities.

The Charleston Was Seen Bound
South Mysterious Vessels in
San Francisco Harbor.
City of Mexico, May 14. The Anglo
American prints a special from San Bias
reporting the rumor about the sinking
of the Itata. Whether she exploded
her mines or was sunk by the Char
leston is not stated.
Encontrila In Mexican Waters.
City of Mexico, May 14. A delayed
telegram just received states that the
Esmeralda left that port, having sought
several favors which were refused. She
received a telegraph from the United
States and then went to meet the Itata.
The Manzanillo telegram says that the
captain of a fishing boat there claims
that his vessel was nearly run down be
fore daylight by a large steamer without
lights, bound north.
WHAT WILL MEXICO DO?
An Interview With Consul General A.
K.
Coney of Mexico.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 14. The Call to
night interviewed Consul-General A. K.
Coney, who is stationed in this port, in
regard to the notion of the Mexican
authorities if the Itata puts into Aca
pulco. "Of course," said Coney, "the
Charleston can only blockade her while
in a Mexican port, but the Mexican offi
cers may themselves seize her. She has
no clearance papers that I know of, cer
tainly none from me, and that fact
would lead to her detention and the in
fliction of a penalty. Then she is re
ported to have arms aboard, and a spe
cial permit is required before such mer
chandise can be brought into the
country. I have no doubt she will be
seized on that ground. The result of
such a seizure would be the institution
of condemnation proceedings, but after
that there is no saying how the incident
would terminate. It would, no doubt,
become an international affair and
would be settled, of course, by the re
presentatives of the interested govern
ments." "Do you think your Government, after
seizing the Itata, would return her over
to the Charleston as an act of friendship
to the United States?"
"Well, no," said the consul, laughing;
"Mexico is very friendly to this Govern
ment, but she is also very friendly to the
established Government of Chile, and
would do no act as a matter of friendship
for one which would inflict a wrong upon
another. She is very conservative, too,
and is not likely to establish precedents
which might afterwards involve her in
interminable trouble. The whole mat
ter of the Itata's character is still a mat
ter of conjecture, and until her standing
is clearly ascertained by proper legal in
quiry nothing will be done to curtail her
rights. If, however, the suspicions
which her actions have raised are veri
fied she will surely be condemned. I
imagine she would in that case be looked
upon as a piratical craft. Whether or
not Mexico would then consider the fact
that she had escaped from the custody
of the United States I cannot say. It is
a knotty question, and the diplomats
will have to settle it."
CHILE STEAMERS OFF.
She Must Capture the Itata at All
Hazards.
RINGGOLD, N. Y., May 14. Secre
tary Tracy is in this city at present. In
an interview with a Republican reporter
tonight he talked about the Itata inci
dent. He scouted the idea that the
Charleston is inferior to the Esmeralda.
It was true the Esmeralda carried two
9-inch guns, while the Charleston's
heaviest guns were only 8-inch, but the
latter had a large number of 6-inch guns,
while her armor was four inches thick
and the Esmeralda's only one and one
half inches. The Charleston was ac
cordingly fully able to cope with the
Esmeralda as were the two other United
States cruisers now in the Pacific.
The Secretary stated definitely that
the Charleston has orders to capture
the Itata wherever she may be found
upon the high seas. He did not antic
ipate a fight, but in case of resistance
the United States cruiser would carry
out her orders at all hazards. He was
not at liberty to state the exact text of
the cipher dispatch sent to the Charles
ton; neither would he say definitely
whether the cruiser San Francisco, now
in Chilian waters, has been ordered to
intercept the Itata.
Rear Admiral McCann's Report.
Washington, May 14. Rear Admiral
McCann, commanding the United States
vessels in Chilian waters, has made the
following report to the Navy Depart
ment under date of Valparaiso, March
31:
"On March 29 the Pensacola returned
to this port from Caldera. On the way
south, and about 100 miles north of this
place, the insurgent Chilian cruiser Es
meralda and the transport Aconcagua
were seen to the southward. It is sup
posed these vessels had been in pursuit
of the Government transport Imperial.
Upon our arrival the latter vessel was
found in port, and it was learned that she
had been chased for sixteen hours by the
insurgent vessels above mentioned.
"The two torpedo cruisers, the Almir
ante Lynch and Almirante Condell, the
eight torpedo boats, only one fitted for
whitehead torpedoes, now in this har
bor, and the gunboat Palcomayo, situa
tion at present unknown, but supposed
to be at Buenos Ayres, constituted the
entire naval force at the disposal of the
Chilian Government.
"The port of Caldera is at present al
most entirely deserted. There were at
the time of our visit only four merchant
ships in port. It is two years since an
American vessel visited the place, and
we have practically no interests there.
At the present time there are at Caldera
only three Americans, including the
Consul, and in Copiapo only three,
which includes the Consul's son. No
preparations have been made to defend
the place in case the insurgents attack
it, but on the contrary the Intendencia
has been moved to Copiapo, about forty
miles inland by rail, and every night all
the rolling stock in use on the road is
removed to that city. There is only a
small cavalry force stationed at Caldera,
and they are always ready to move into
the interior at a moment's notice. The
railroad machine shops have been dis
mantled, so that, if the insurgents take
Caldera, they will find no facilities for
repairing their ships.
"The English force on the coast in
cludes the Warsprite, Champion, Daphne,
Acorn and Espiegle.
"From my own observation and from
what I can learn of the condition of the
insurgent vessels, all but one of them
are in a very crippled condition and in
no way fit to work around these waters
during a norther. It is also in my op
inion very doubtful if they will risk their
only efficient but unarmored vessel un
der the fire of the batteries at Valparaiso
at any time, but especially during the
norther season."

Other Vessels Chartered.
San Francisco, May 14. Some ves
sels in this port have been acting very
mysteriously, and it is now stated that
the schooner Robert and Minnie is not
the only vessel that was chartered to
convey arms and ammunition to the
Chilian insurgents, but that other ves
sels chartered are now unwilling to ship
contraband goods or have put into Oak
land creek, on the other side of San
Francisco bay, until it is demonstrated
whether such cargoes could safely be
taken out. The United States District
Attorney has definitely ascertained the
roads over which the large quantity of
guns and ammunition which formed the
cargo of the Robert and Minnie came
into the State, and it is claimed the
Federal authorities will endeavor to
compel the railway officials to disclose
the quantity delivered and those known
to be on the road. It is further stated
that a few days before the cartridges
were bought in the East, the Chilian
agent called at the office of the local
agent of the United States Cartridge
Company and made inquiries as to his
ability to procure 50,000 cartridges of
forty-three calibre inside of three weeks.
The District Attorney has had a consul
tation with the Chilian Consul, and
steps will be taken to seize the guns and
ammunition understood to be on the
way from the East.
They Meet the Cruiser Charleston.
Special Dispatch to the Republican.
San Diego, May 14. Passengers who
came in on the steamer Crescent City,
which arrived from Cedros Island lately,
tell the following story of meeting the
cruiser Charleston in her flight south
ward: When about ten miles below
Ensenada Monday night the cruiser was
sighted far out to sea. As soon as the
officers on the warship caught sight of
the Crescent City they changed their
course and made directly for her. As
the cruiser approached and as soon as
her name could be made out the captain
of the Crescent City raised the Ameri
can flag to the masthead and dipped it
three times as a salute. Without a sign
of recognition, however, the cruiser im
mediately turned at right angles and
steamed away to the southwest, soon
disappearing beyond the horizon.
The Capture Unconfirmed.
San Francisco, May 14. The rumors
coming from the City of Mexico to the
effect that the cruiser Charleston had
overtaken the steamer Itata and fired
upon that vessel are regarded here as
having no foundation. The Charleston
passed San Diego at noon on Monday.
The run to Acapulco, the nearest tele
graph point below the Gulf of Califor
nia, is 1,300 miles. The Charleston
was steaming at the rate of about fifteen
knots an hour and was seen to be mov
ing out of her course to inspect the pass
ing vessels. Even though pushed to
her highest point of speed she could not
reach Acapulco before tomorrow and
any news of her could not be received
through Mexican sources before her ar
rival there tomorrow.
No Chilian Ships In Mexico.
City of Mexico, May 14. The Gov
ernment denies that any Chilian ships
touched at any Mexican port up to a late
hour tonight, or that any conflict took
place at San Bias as rumored.
No News at Washington.
Washington, May 14. No news of the
Itata or Charleston has been received at
the Navy Department and no credence
is given to the report that the Charles
ton has sunk the Itata.
A Large Shipment of Brandy.
Sacramento, May 14. One of the
largest shipments of brandy ever made
from this city is to be sent to Europe in
two or three days. The consignment
will consist of 312 packages, containing
18,170 gallons, which have been on
storage in a United States bonded ware
house here for Natoma vineyard, and
will go to Bremen, Germany, by sea
from Sacramento.
Parnell Politically Dead.
Liverpool, May 14. 'Michael Davitt
and family sailed today for Quebec en
route to San Francisco. In an inter
view previous to his departure Davitt
said: "After the next general election
Parnell will have only four followers,
except as private members of Parlia
ment. Parnell is dead as dodo."
Fire In Oil Works.
Philadelphia, May 14. This after
noon a fire is raging in the Belmont oil
works, and it is believed the entire
plant will be destroyed.
Elevator Burned.
Bozeman, Mont., May 14. The Mon
tana elevator burned here today, in
volving a loss of $75,000. Insurance,
$50,000.
Iron Broker Fails.
Glasgow, May 14. R. Kitson, an iron
broker of this city, failed. His liabili
ties are large.

AT LINCOLN TOMB
The Remarks of President
Harrison

Over the Grave of the Dead
Hero.
He
Again Comes into His Native
State and Addresses His
Countrymen.
SPRINGFIELD, Ill., May 14. The Presi
dential train made an early stop at Han
nibal, Mo., and was greeted at every
subsequent station by enthusiastic
crowds. On their arrival here the party
was escorted to Lincoln monument, in
Oakridge Cemetery, where formal cere
monies took place. Governor Fifer
delivered an eloquent address of wel
come, to which President Harrison re
sponded very feelingly.
"You have here in keeping most
precepts, and I trust toward this spot
the feet of reverent patriots of years to
come will wend their way, and as the
story of Lincoln's life as read there, will
continually be spread through and all
over our country influences and hope
and inspirations to generations of chil
dren that are yet to come. We can say
nothing that will deepen the impres
sions of this great life. I have studied
it and been filled with wonder. His
life was an American product; no other
soil could produce it, and the greatness
of it has not yet been discovered or
measured.
"In the time in which we live we find
how his great mind was turned and
moved in time of peril and delicacy the
forces of our country in our home and in
their foreign relations with that mar
velous tact, with that never-failing com
mon sense which characterized this man
of the people. And what impressive
lesson we have this morning as I see in
the uniform of my country, standing as
guards around this tomb, the sons of
that race that had been condemned to
slavery and was emancipated by his im
mortal proclamation. What an appro
priate thing it is that these, who were
once a despised race, whose civil rights
were curtailed even in this State, are
now affectionate guardians of the ashes
and tomb in which they sleep. If we
will all again read the story of Lincoln's
life we will find our minds and hearts
enlarged, our life deepened and our con
secrated devotion to the Government,
which he preserved to us, deepened and
intensified.
Indianapolis.
Indianapolis, May 14. A large dele
gation of Indiana friends met the Presi
dential party at Montezuma and made
themselves hoarse cheering the Presi
dent. He was overcome by the greet
ing. He said in part:
"My friends, we have had a long
journey, and one attended by a great many
pleasant incidents. Everywhere we
have had a most cordial and kindly
greeting, but as I cross today the border
line of Indiana, and meet again these
old friends, I find in your welcome a
sweetness that exceeds it all."
At this point tears came to the Presi
dent's eyes, and his utterances became
so choked he could say no more. He
soon recovered, however, and extended
his cordial welcome to the Indianapolis
reception committee.
The train arrived at this city promptly
at 4:45 this afternoon. Its approach
was heralded by an artillery salute.
Preparations for the President's recep
tion were magnificent in every way,
considering the limited length of his
stay. From every window and house
top in the principal down-town streets
the stars and stripes hung or were un
furled to the breeze, and large sized
pictures of the President were conspic
uous everywhere. On a decorated stand
was a crowd who in cheers gave the
President a genuine Hoosier welcome to
his old home. When the President ar
rived at the stand Governor Hovey ad
dressed the multitude, and Mayor Sul
livan in a neat speech welcomed the
President home.
President Harrison responded in part:
"I do not think I can speak much today.
The strain of the long journey and fre
quent calls made on me to speak from
Washington to the Golden Gate and
from the far Northwest back to Indiana
have somewhat exhausted me and made
my heart so open to those impressions
as may greet my old friends that I can
not, I fear, command myself. Our path
way has been marked by the plaudits of
the multitude; our way strewn with
flowers, but all the sweetness of these
flowers, all the beauty of the almost
tropical lands, all the richness of the
precious mines, shrink from comparison
as I receive today this
welcome from my old friends." There
was perceptible moisture in the Presi
dent's eyes. "My manhood has known
no other home but this. It was the
scene of my early struggles. It has
been the scene and instrument and sup
port of my early success in life. I come
to lay down before you today my offer
ing of thankfulness for friendly helpful
ness in boyhood and in all hours down
to this. I left you, two years ago, to
take up the work of the most responsi
ble office in the world. I went to
these untried, sustained by your
helpful friendliness. I come, after two
years, to confess many errors, but to say
to you I have not done ill in mind
to use whatever influence I have for the
general good of all the people." Applause. "Our stay is so brief I must de
ny myself the pleasure of taking an
hand these friends by the hand. God bless
you all. I have not forgotten or cannot
forget Indianapolis. I look forward, if
my life is spared, to this city, where I
shall rest when toil is done. I love its
home and rejoice in its commercial pros
perity." The party soon started for
Washington.
Conference of Charities and Corrections.
INDIANAPOLIS, May 14. The session

ITALIAN CONSUL CORTE
Interviewed Before Leaving; on the Kill
ing at New Orleans.
New Orleans, May 14. In an inter
view with a reporter today the Italian
Consul Corte said, referring to the re
marks of the Mayor and Grand Jury:
"Let me tell you that I have saved
Mayor Shakespeare's life and I have done
the same service for Parkerson and
Wickliffe and other leaders. The day of
the killing there was a determined, ab
solutely almost uncontrollable, determi
nation among certain of my countrymen
to kill the Mayor and all those who had
a hand in the butchery. But I restrained
their hands. I controlled furious men.
Held them to beware. I said if any
harm befell those gentlemen I
would immediately and unreservedly
denounce the perpetrators of the deed.
This firm stand checked them and I
succeeded in holding them with the
promise that I would do everything in
my power to obtain justice, redress and
satisfaction in a proper and legitimate
manner by arbitration and other diplo
matic measures between the two govern
ments." Corte insisted that he had
conclusive evidence that among the
killed were several Italian subjects, and
that they could have proven an alibi as
clear as daylight, to exculpate them
from the Hennessy murder. Speaking
about the return of his letter by the
grand jury, Corte said: "Could I
expect any more from a grand jury
whose chairman, as President of the
Cotton Exchange, indorsed the killing?"
AGAINST SECRET ORDERS.
The Matter of Secret Societies Thoroughly
Ventilated.
Chicago, May 14. The fourth annual
Christian Conference on the Secret
Lodge System convened here today,
delegates being present from all over
the country. The topic under discussion
was "Temperance Orders," the opening
paper being read by Rev. A. Thompson,
of Bartlett, Iowa.
He decided the secret societies were
doing more than anything else to dis
rupt the church. In his experience,
temperance lodges had detracted greatly
from the Sunday schools. The topic was
discussed at length. A paper was read
by Rev. C. F. Hawley on "Industrial
Orders." Laboring classes, he said,
should organize for mutual instruction,
benefit and political action, but the
minute they became a secret order it
became wrong from the very fact that it
breeds corruption.
Shot and Killed In the Streets.
Los Angeles, May 14. Joe Dye, a
well known oil operator of Ventura, was
shot and killed here this afternoon at
3:20 by Nate Bradfield. The latter fired
both barrels of a double barrel shotgun
from a second story of Arlington house
on Los Angeles street as Dye was walk
ing past. Nine of the buckshot struck
Dye, one just above the heart, and he
died in seven minutes without speaking.
A stray shot struck and wounded a man
named Riley but not seriously. The
shooter and his victim had been busi
ness partners and it is believed the diffi
culty arose from a dispute about oil
lands in which Dye was coming out
ahead. Bradfield was arrested. About
five years ago Dye shot and killed a man
in the scape who had accused him of
seducing his wife. Bradfield is nephew
of Udell, the prominent oil operator of
Ventura county.
