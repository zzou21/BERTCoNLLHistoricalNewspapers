NEGRO CONVICT
DIES SUDDENLY;
MYSTERIOUSLY
Expires From Ruptured Artery
Day After Received—Inquest
Finds No Cause
The mysterious death Wednesday
of Buster Whitehead, a negro, on the
Sumter county chain gang, on the
second day he had been placed on
the gang, was the topic of conversation
about Americus today, following
a coroner’s inquest held over his
body Wednesday afternoon and a
post mortem examination made by
Dr. F. L. Cato, county physician. On
the insistence of members of the coroner’s jury,
who were unable to obtain any clue to the cause of the
negro’s death from witnesses, Dr. Cato
made a thorough examination, at the
conclusion of which he announced
that the negro came to his death from
pulmonary embolism—a blood clot
in the lung caused from an arterial
rupture producing strangulation from
the flow of blood into the lung. This
was the form of the verdict of the
coroner’s jury.
Dr. Cato at the time gave no explanation
as to the probable cause of
the negro’s condition, but today when
confronted by a Times-Recorder reporter
stated that he did not know what was
the cause of the condition and that
there was no way in which it could
be determined. He would venture
no opinion, but said such condition
sometimes results from internal
causes such as a diseased or weak
blood vessel. He insisted that in his
examination he found no evidences
whatever of external violence.
The negro who was sentenced to
the chain gang from the City court
Monday, was taken to the convict
camp 4 1/2 miles southeast of Americus
on the Leslie road Tuesday morning. He worked
part of the day, and Wednesday forenoon, according
to testimony, stopped work, lying
down and complaining that he was
ill. According to the testimony
force was used to restrain him by
both Harry McCoy, a white convict
trusty, who has been given a place
as gang boss, and by J. H. Cobb, a
convict guard.
That the force used was not so
severe would be indicated by the statement
of Dr. Cato after the post mortem that he could find no evidences
of violence. No post mortem was given
by the inquest that the negro had
been punished, and all witnesses gave
much the same evidence, declaring
that there had been no trouble.
Whitehead was on Americus no
longer, apparently robust and in the
best of health when turned over to
the gang Tuesday. He was arrested
a short time ago by the police for
chicken stealing.
Friends of Mrs. Nan Johnson will
regret to hear of her illness at her
home on Prince street.

AS STOCK STATE
AMES, Ia., Sept. 22. -There are
610 co-operative livestock shipping
associations in Iowa, covering more
than 700 towns and villages and

What’s the Matter
With Us, Anyway?
SAMUEL M. VAUCLAIN, PRESIDENT OF BALDWIN LOCO-
MOTIVE WORKS, ANSWERS QUESTION FOR TIMES-RECORDER.

What’s the matter with us, anyway?
What is the cause of business
depression and unemployment?
What can remedy conditions?
These questions everyone is asking. For they affect everyone in
timately, vitally. Everyone is feeling the effects of commercial
stagnation, either in wages or dividends.
The Times-Recorder, through
the N. E. A. Service, has asked the
men who should be best able to
answer these questions for their
diagnosis of the situation. It has
received signed statements from a
number of national figures, whose
names appear in an announcement
elsewhere in this issue. The first
of these is offered here today. Others
will follow.
BY SAMUEL M. VAUCLAIN
President, Baldwin Locomotive
Works.
The chief thing that will help us
is lack of capital.
That is the outstanding link in
the chain of reasons for business
depression and
unemployment.
And the reason
why so many people do not understand what is
the matter with us
is this:
People are not willing to realize that
work—not money is the basis
of prosperity.
We do not get
enough. Look for
the money we pay; nor enough food
nor clothes, nor housing. We are
suffering from a depreciated value
of our own money. Our money’s
value is unimpaired in other countries
—but we can’t sell our goods abroad,
and we only get about 50 cents value
on the dollar here.
The only way to analyze the business
situation is to analyze your own
household. If you can bring its cost
and its standards down to the 1913
level you will get along—buy you
won’t have many things you have
had lately.
Apparently we must wait till hard
times pull people down to doing
without things, to make them realize
what has happened—and to get the
dollar back to its normal value.
Conditions Improve.
They will get better. But it will take
time. To improve, everybody
must do his bit, only labor, or capital, or
the former. We want industry.
Every living business man today
is trying to get enough work to keep,
himself running on reasonable
time. The Baldwin Works are running 33 percent capacity. Steel
mills are doing the same thing. Not
because we don't want to run to capacity—but because the money is not
available to swing it.
We are all working people, supporting each other. Closed plants
throw thousands out of work, but
that hurts the factory owner more
than it helps him. A closed plant
fairly eats on money, with no
return. There are no dividends. Labor
is cut down, or
cut off. And if it is because
there are no dividends, for otherwise the
plant would operate. And the stock
holder suffers when there are no
dividends.
Cutting Prices.
A desperate effort is being made
to reduce the cost of things. Steel,
is the basis of everything. If steel
mills were busy, railroads would be
busy, everybody would be busy. It's
the endless chain—each of us dependent upon the other fellow. Slipping each
other; one on the rocks; the
other fellow is on the
rocks—no capital to float the ship.
What we need is for somebody to
stick his finger into that endless
chain and thrill things. Secretary
Mellon has done that every thing with
his new tax proposal. He has the
right idea you can’t expect a revival in business unless business
men are left to do business
with. All
Money is here for use. It ought
not to be gobbled up. The ideal thing
would be universal taxation, spread
out so well that nobody would miss
it. The
dividing man thinks he escapes tax
but the business man is taxed. But
it always comes out of his hide.
There is no other way to get it.
The Idea.
It is a mistake for anybody, complaining against unemployment, to
think that, if the business man
didn’t have to pay an enormous
excess profits tax or didn’t have
more of his income taken away by
the government the business man is
being properly taxed.
The working man has to pay too, if
you’re going to make more work for;
everybody.
The public. Anybody can see that.
When wrong with is to mean
and an endless chain of circumstances are;
Nobody is to blame for it
everybody is!

National Bank, New York.

MRS. TYLER TRIES
TO ‘FIRE’ KLEAGLE BATE
But Imperial Wizard Simmons
Says She Hasn’t The Power
To Do It
HO! DS RESIGNATIONS
OF CLARKE AND WOMAN
But Hasn’t Indicated He Will Ac
cept Them—All Not
Harmony In Ranks
Washington, Sept. 22—High
officials of the Ku Klux Klan may
be in Washington for internally the Department of
Justice, Attorney General Daugherty
instructed today. Director W. J.
Burns of the Bureau of Investigation
has been instructed to set agents at
work on an investigation of the
Klan organization in various parts
of the country.
GOVERNOR CONDEMNS
KLAN BEFORE MASONS.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 22.—Governor
Hyde, of Missouri, condemned the
Ku Klux Klan as an organization
before five hundred members of the
Grand Lodge Masons of Missouri last
night, declaring it a “secret and furtive organization whose methods are
subversive to American ideals and
the rule of law.” He declared Masons
have no connection with the Ku
Klux organization and want nothing to do
with it.
MRS. TYLER TRIES TO
‘FIRE’ KLEAGLE BATE.
ATLANTA, Sept. 22—That all is
not harmony within the ranks of the imperial officers here
of the Ku Klux Klan, which has been
decrying as a result of the expose
of the New York World, is indicated by the fact that Mrs. Elizabeth
Tyler, who was mentioned as having been arrested with Edward Young Clarke, imperial kleagle, some time ago, has
telegraphed to New Jersey ordering
the dismissal of Kleagle Bate who
telegraphed Imperial Wizard Sim
mons Tuesday demanding the dismissal of both Clarke and Mrs. Tyler,
and by the denial of Col. Simmons
that Bate has been “fired.” Col.
Simmons stated that he held the
resignation of Clarke and Mrs. Tyler
in abeyance until he found their connection
with the order embarrassing.
Mrs. Tyler stated that she had
sent a telegram “firing” Bate immediately after his telegram was received at the offices of the Ku Klux
Klan. She said she told Bate in
the telegram that he was “utterly
unworthy of the honorable title of
Kleagle” and informed him that she
was telegraphing to Grand Goblin
Adkins to revoke Bate’s commission
in New Jersey.
Result of Changes.
Mrs. Tyler said she had found it
necessary to make several changes
in the Klan’s organization in New
Jersey and these changes had been
made over Bate. She said his
demanding for her discharge
was a surprise to her in view
of what had gone before.
In the telegram of
Mrs. Tyler dismissing Bate from his
district kleagle, Col. Simmons, and Mrs. Tyler did not have
the authority to discharge Bate.
“This firing credited to Mrs.
Tyler is only partially correct.
I agreed with her that any
man who would judge hastily after
having heard only one side of a case
and demand the dismissal of Mr.
Clarke and Mrs. Tyler because of
statements implicated in a newspaper
without making any effort to
learn the facts of the case or
give them opportunity to plead
their case was un-
fit for a position of responsibility.
I have wired
Grand Goblin Adkins.
The reason New Jersey is lo-
cated in the Grand Goblin’s
jurisdiction and from that no
action in the case has been author
ized. No action will be
taken until we have completed an
investigation.”
“Bate has not been fired.”
