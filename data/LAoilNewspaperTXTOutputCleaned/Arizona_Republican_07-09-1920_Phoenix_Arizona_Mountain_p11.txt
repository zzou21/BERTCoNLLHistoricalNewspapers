In the kitchen of her own home Sister Mary cooks
daily, for family of four adults. She brought to her
kitchen an understanding of the chemistry of cooking,
gained from study of domestic science in a state university. Consequently the advice she offers is a happy com
bination of theory and practice. Every recipe she gives,
is her own. First tried out and served at her family table.
Nasturtium leaves make an attractive garnish for a
salad. Nearly every house has a few nasturtium vines and
when a salad must be made out of thin air, as it were, the
spicy leaves are delicious in place of lettuce.
Sandwiches can also be made of nasturtium leaves
and mayonnaise. Cut white bread very thin, spread with
butter, add a leaf of nasturtium, spread with mayonnaise
and add the other half of the sandwich. The bitiness of
the herb makes a sandwich especially good to serve, with
tea.

AMERICAN

WAR NURSES DECORATED
WITH FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE MEDAL

Menu for Tomorrow
Breakfast Blackberries, cooked ce
real, baking powder biscuits, coffee.
Luncheon Tomato sandwiches, fan
cy rice pudding, tea.
Dinner- Lamb stew and dumplings,
boiled summer squash, lettuce salad,
cherry pie, coffee.
My Own Recipes
When dumplings are served with
meat it is not necessary to have two
vegetables with a salad. Summer
squash is better to boil than to bake.
The skin should be very thin and ten
der, and the squash itself should be
young.
Tomato Sandwiches
White bread.
Cream cheese.
Anchovy paste.
Tomatoes.
Mayonnaise.
Cut bread one-fourth inch thick.
Spread very sparingly with anchovy
paste. Add a thin layer of cheese, a
slice of tomato the size of the bread.
Spread with mayonnaise and top with
a buttered piece of bread. As these
sandwiches are rather thick, they are

nicer to eat if served on a plate with
a fork.
Fancy Rice Pudding
8 tablespoons rice.
3 cups milk.
2 eggs.
12 tablespoons sugar.
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract.
5 tart apples.
1/2 cup raisins.
Currant jelly.
6 tablespoons powdered sugar.
Boil rice in salted water for 30 min
utes. Add milk, yolks of eggs, sugar,
raisins and lemon extract. Pare apples
and remove cores from the stem end.
The blossom end of the apple must not
be broken. Arrange in a buttered bak
ing dish. Pour rice custard around but
not covering apples. Bake in a moderate oven for 50 or 60 minutes. When
done, let cool and drop into each apple
cup a spoonful of currant jelly. Cap
each apple with a peak of meringue,
made of the stiffly beaten whites of the
eggs and the powdered sugar. Lay
around the edge a border of the sec
tions of a juicy orange, from which
every bit of skin has been removed.

Greater love hath no woman than this: that she go
shopping for a friend on a hot summer day.

THE BOOK OF ANN
How Would a "Divorce Card" Look
With My Name on It?
Dear Daddy Lorimer was convinced
that he had saved Ann from a big
scandal by buying the decorating busi
ness and ridding the town of its deco
rative manager. Daddy felt sure that
he had solved all the intolerable prob
lems Ann had introduced into the Lor
imer affairs. Ann had had her les
son a humiliating one, he said.
I was not so confident about daddy's
success. But I didn't put my doubt
into words because daddy was so
awfully happy over his own cleverness.
Neither did I tell him how completely
Ann had destroyed my joy in life.
After daddy left me, I put in a mis
erable day. I couldn't shorten the
time until Bob should come home by
any active employment; I couldn't
make up Bob's bed nor arrange his
room as he liked it, for there was a
new maid to attend to everything.
I couldn't go away from home; Bob
might repent and call me by phone.
I would be a tragedy to miss any

They represent America's nursing roll of honor since 1914

WASHINGTON. D. C. "Great and exceptional devotion to the sick and
wounded in peace and war."
Without this distinguishing service
no nurse can be awarded the Florence
Nightingale Medal, the highest deco
ration of the nursing world, created in
1912.
The American Red Cross has been
notified that this honor has been be
stowed by the International committee
of the Red Cross, Geneva, upon six
American nurses. Since only one
nurse of any nation may receive this
medal annually, this means that the
six women just honored represent
America's nursing roll of honor since
the outbreak of the World War in 1914.
The medal was given to forty-one

nurses of various nations at this first
awarding of it since its authorization.
The American nurses are:
Martha M. Russell, of Boulder, Colo.,
who was appointed first representative
of the American Red Cross Nursing
Service in France in July, 1917, to or
ganize Red Cross nursing activities
there; Linda K. Meirs, of Boston,
Mass., who went to France with the
American Red Cross but was trans
ferred to the Army Nurse Corps and
served under fire, later went with the
American Red Cross Commission to
Rumania and was decorated by the
Rumanian government; Mary E. Glad
win of New York City, who sailed on
the Red Cross ship, September, 1914,
as supervisor of a unit assigned to

Serbian service, remaining five years;
Helen Scott Hay of Washington, D. C.,
chief nurse of the American Red Cross
Commission for Europe, who began her
war service in 1914; Florence Merriam
Johnson of New York City, director of
the department of nursing of the At
lantic division of American Red Cross;
Alma E. Foerster of Chicago, who
sailed for service in Russia on the Red
Cross relief ship in 1914, remaining in
Europe throughout the war.

chance of "making up."
I didn't want to see company: it

would hurt dreadfully to wrench my

mind from the circle of my own af
fairs.

I employed myself as do all good
wives in similar circumstances, I sup
pose. I darned Bob's socks, sewed on
all his loose buttons, looked over his
collection of neckties and threw away
the frayed ones. Then I put the draw
ers of his chiffonier in order.
Bob doesn't keep a valet. In the
old time of his radical thinking be
fore the war he had discharged his
man. He said he didn't feel like a
free and independent human being
when another man drew his bath every
morning.
I have always been so glad that I
appreciate Bob's brand of democracy.
It's a comfort to realize that if I die,
or if we are ever divorced and Bob
should marry again he probably will
not find a wife who will sympathize
with his advanced views as I do.
"If ever we are divorced."
Whenever we two have the least lit

tle bit of a tiff I think of that horrid
possibility. Divorces are now so com
mon in the nicest families.
Only two days ago a new thing in
"card etiquette" came in our mail. It
was the announcement of a divorce;
a beautifully engraved bit of paste
board a trifle larger than a woman's
calling card. It read

n i tw m jv fi an ij h a n n it m

Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bryce Allen
Mutually Announce Their
Divorce.
Bob had given the card his serious
attention.
"Well, why not?" he said. "If peo
ple consider you interested in their
wedding, so that they send you cards
to say they are going to be married
at a certain time, and set up house
keeping together in a certain place,
obviously, they ought to inform you
when they break up their establish
ment. First-class idea, this divorce
announcement, seems to me."
As I sewed the buttons on Bob's pon
gee shirt, I wondered how such a card
would look with Bob's name and mine
in the first line. The idea was too
dreadful. My imagination was getting
the better of my reason. I knew I
could bring on a grand fit of hysteria
unless I exercised a little restraint.
"And all my worries have been
caused by a girl, who hasn't an atom
of sense." So ran my thoughts. "Two
months ago I had never heard of Ann.
She simply walked into this family
and because she hasn't any ideals at
all she has kept us stirred up ever
since she married our Jim. She may
fool daddy, but not me. Goodness
knows what she'll be up to next. She'll
get herself arrested, maybe."

ADVENTURES
OF THE TWINS
By Olive Roberts Barton.

MR. TINGALING GETS WET
Tingaling, lying in Chirk Chipmunk's bed, recovering from his bruises after
he had fallen through the rickety stairs in Chirk's house (clear to the cellar),
heard it thundering outside.
"Well, well," he said to the twins, "it's going to storm, I'm afraid! I'll just
rest a spell in bed here then, and my bruises will have a better chance to get
well. But when the sun comes out, we'll have to be going or rent day will be
over before I get around to all the animals in the Land-of-Dear-Knows-Where.
And when I'm late getting around they have all their money spent and
I don't know what he was going to say next, nor will anybody else. 'Cause
why? A great big rain-drop had come down plop right onto the end of his
nose, washing off the coal-dust and making a cute little lake. Tingaling quite
forgot what he was going to say, he was so surprised. Rain in the house!
Incomprehensible! Mystificationable!

"Don't be alarmed, Mr. Tingaling," he said assuringly, "I always sleep this
way."
No, it couldn't be! His brain was still playing him tricks after his bad
bump, surely! But, splash! Another drop made a puddle on his right cheek.
Nancy saw it, so did Nick. Then another made a pool on his left cheek. And
in another minute, pitter, patter, drop, splash! Little rain-drops were making
rivers and lakes and oceans all over him, right there in bed. It was raining
perfect puppy-dogs through a big hole in the roof.
Chirk hurried to the closet, returning with his best green cotton umbrella,
and raising it, he spread it carefully over the fairyman landlord. "Don't be
alarmed, Mr. Tingaling," he said assuringly, "I always sleep this way. I
haven't slept without an umbrella over me for a year come April Fool's Day.
I put dish-pans and buckets around, too."
But Tingaling wasn't going to lie in such a downpour. Out he crawled,
bruises and all!

Use Kerr Mason Caps
on ALL Mason Jars.
They make canning with Mason jars a
pleasure. Easy to seal and easy to open
no tiresome twisting or forcing of the cap
necessary. Patented sealing composition on
the Lid does away with rubber rings, and
seals jar AIRTIGHT no mould or spoilage.
Cheaper to use than old style caps with rub
ber rings. The screw band is used many
times each season lasts for years does not
corrode; while the Lid, which you

puncture to open the jar, costs about
the same as rubber rings. Your
dealer has KERR Mason Caps and
extra Lids, or can get them from
