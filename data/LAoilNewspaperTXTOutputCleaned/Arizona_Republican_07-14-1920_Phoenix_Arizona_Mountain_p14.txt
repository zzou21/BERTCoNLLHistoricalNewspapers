THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 14, 1920

U. S. TO LEGION

IN BIG CELEBRATION

ARMISTICE DAY

An armistice day celebration, de
signed to eclipse any ceremony of the
kind ever before held in the United
States, possible through arrange
ments just made with the war depart
ment by which Legionnaires and all
others who desire it, including the next
of kin of those who died in the service,
may have their victory medals deliv
ered to them in care of the command
ers of Legion posts in their respective
communities, declares Lemuel Bolles,
national adjutant, in a letter to all
Legionnaires.
This paves the way for formal pres
entation of the medals in simultaneous
ceremonies which should live in his
tory as the crowning feature of the
greatest of all armistice days, and
which collectively should constitute the
most impressive, far-reaching and ap
propriate patriotic function that could
possibly be devised.
At the request of the Legion’s na
tional commander, the war depart
ment has consented to deliver upon
request, through the nearest army
post or recruiting station, to the com
mander of each Legion post, applica
tion blanks as are needed in his com
munity. After these have been prop
erly filled out and forwarded, the vic
tory medals will be mailed to the in
dividual Legionnaires in care of their
respective post commanders, who can
keep them pending the date for joint
community presentation ceremonies.
In filling out these blanks, however,
the delivery address must be given as
in care of the post commander.
Post commanders must obtain these
blanks and detailed instruction for fill
ing them out from the nearest army
post or recruiting station. It is sug
gested that posts furnish typewriters
and the free services of a notary not
only for their members, but also for
all ex-service persons, and especially
for relatives of our departed comrades,
in order to insure the proper filling
out of the applications and to avoid
unnecessary errors which might delay
delivery of the medals until after
armistice day.
There is ample time for preparation
of programs as elaborate as posts or
groups of posts care to make them.
Here is opportunity for the receipt of
the medal to become an important
epoch in the life of every ex-service
person and for the anniversary of the
official ending of the world war to re
ceive a splendid historical setting as
significant as that of the Fourth of
July or Memorial day. National head
quarters appeals to all departments
and posts for whole-hearted co-opera
tion and team play to put this across
for the everlasting glory of America
and the Legion. It is believed that it
would be the ideal hour to have
the ceremonies begin.

FALLS 14 FEET AND IS
INSTANTLY KILLED

Falling 14 feet from the scaffolding
of the new Episcopal church at First
avenue and Roosevelt street, Nepoma
cino Arvisu, a Mexican employed on
the construction work, struck the back
of his neck on a large wooden block
in the ground and was instantly killed.
His neck was broken. The coroner’s
jury returned a verdict of death re
sulting through the carelessness of the
deceased.
At the time of the accident, Arvisu
was engaged in passing up boards
handed him from the ground to a man
on another scaffold 23 feet from the
ground. Because of his ability to speak
English, Arvisu had been made fore
man over the other Mexicans on the
job. His home was at Sixth avenue
and Madison street. A wife and five
children survive.

FIRST PLANS FOR
UNION STATION
ARE DUE FRIDAY

Initial Specifications of New
Union Depot Expected to
Be Presented to Corpora
tion Commission by R. R.’s

First tentative plans for a new union
station in Phoenix are expected to be
presented to the state corporation com
mission Friday of this week by the
Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix and
the Arizona Eastern railroad com
panies.

At a hearing called some time ago by
the commission for the purpose of se
curing better depot facilities in this
city, data was presented showing the
great growth in railroad business in
Phoenix and the present inadequate
facilities with which the city has con
tended for a long time. It was prac
tically agreed by the railroads that
better station accommodations were
needed, but additional time was re
quested by them in which to prepare
plans. This request was granted by
the commission and the date was set
for Friday, July 16.
The fight on the part of Phoenix for
a union station has been waged for
many years. Owing to the war, how
ever, the matter was postponed until
last winter when it was revived with
spirit and a determination to secure
results. All the civic bodies joined
in the campaign and the advantages
of a union station to both the rail
roads and the public were pointed out
which made it clear that present in
tolerable conditions could not continue
indefinitely.
After separate depots were discussed,
the railroads practically agreed that a
union station should be constructed.
What the roads have to offer will be
heard with interest at the meeting on
Friday.
One matter that probably will be de
cided at Friday’s hearing, is whether
there is ample room on the land be
tween the present Santa Fe and Ari
zona Eastern depots for a union sta
tion or whether another site will have
to be found.

$11,000 DAMAGES
ARE ASKED IN SUIT

Declaring that he has suffered $11,
000 damages through the failure of the
defendants to carry out the agreement
entered into before he purchased 40
acres of land from them, R. C. Snod
grass, with Eula Snodgrass, his wife,
yesterday brought suit against J. W.
Turner and Lucy P. Turner, his wife,
asking for a judgment. Snodgrass al
leges that on February 1, 1920, Turner
showed him some land near Arlington
and says that in order to get him to
buy it, Turner promised to have the
land leveled off, cleared, bordered and
broke by March 15.
Snodgrass further alleges that Turner
agreed in case he bought the land
to install an irrigation system con
nected with the Arlington canal, and
says that Turner agreed that if this
system did not furnish enough water
for the crops he would sink wells and
install a pumping system on the land
or on other acreage nearby which
would furnish ample water for the 1920
crop. Snodgrass claims that he bought
the land relying on Turner to keep his
agreement and says he paid $8000 for
the ranch. After he became the own
er, Snodgrass declares, Turner refused
to keep his agreement.

Forty-five thousand men and $50,
000,000 have left the state of Nebraska
for western Canada in the last 20
years, according to a report by the
Canadian government office at Omaha.

WOMAN STILL
UNABLE TO TELL STORY
OF FATAL TRAIN WRECK

Miss Hazel Jamison, 20-year-old
telegraph operator at Skull Valley, who
figured in the fatal wreck on the Santa
Fe, Prescott & Phoenix railroad last
Friday morning, is still in a serious
condition in a Prescott hospital, rail
road officials say, and her life is de
spaired of. It will be some time, if at
all, before she will be able to relate
her version of the accident, it is stated.
Miss Jamison is one of two sisters
who were employed as telegraphers at
the Skull Valley station, and she was
regarded as one of the most reliable
and dependable operators on the line,
officials declare. She worked the
"third trick" at Skull Valley, or from
midnight until 8 o'clock in the morn
ing. Her sister worked "second trick,"
from 4 until 12 p. m.
Although no official statement has
been issued by local railroad men, it
was asserted that it is "highly im
probable" that the cantaloupe train
was proceeding northward under posi
tive meet orders. "The probability is
that the freight had ‘wait orders’ un
der which it was moving," said one of
the officials.
All trains, they pointed out, are
operated under standard railroad reg
ulations. Wickenburg was the last
station at which the freight could have
received any dispatches regarding train
movements, they said, although there
are half a dozen stations between
Wickenburg and Kirkland, where the
freight and passenger were to have
met. No operators, however, were on
duty at any of these stations.
Just before the arrival of the south
bound passenger train at Skull Valley,
the train dispatcher put a series of
two or three orders on the wire. One
version of the accident, as expressed
unofficially by railroad men, was that
an early wait order was later super
seded by a positive meet order and that
in the confusion the girl-telegrapher
delivered the first order to the passen
ger train conductor.
The official state investigation of the
accident will start Friday morning at
10 o'clock under the direction of the
state corporation commission.
H. C. Storey, superintendent of the
line, and W. A. Drake, general man
ager, will be called to testify. Several
passengers on the southbound passen
ger train will also be called, it was
stated. The records of the dispatching
office at Prescott will also be a part of
the evidence submitted before the
hearing. Fixing of blame for the acci
dent will devolve upon the corpora
tion commission as a result of the
inquiry.
Material damage caused by the
wreck was fixed at approximately $60,
000 by Fred P. Cruice, general freight
and passenger agent of the Santa Fe
line for this district.

BABY IS BURNED TO
DEATH AT BUCKEYE

In a fire which completely destroyed
their home, the 17-months-old daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Homer Bogdonoff,
living seven miles west of Phoenix on
the lower Buckeye road, was burned
to death Monday afternoon before the
parents could rescue her. Immedi
ately after the fire the body of the
child was taken to the Russian colony
near Glendale by the parents, but the
officers were not notified of the acci
dent until Tuesday morning. Coroner
McKee then went to the place and
held an inquest, the verdict being ac
cidental death caused by fire.
According to the story told by the
parents, they left the child asleep on
the bed after dinner on Monday and
went to work in the cotton fields. An
hour later they discovered the house
in flames but were unable to reach
the baby before the body was burned
to a crisp. The origin of the fire is
not known.

The total estimated agricultural
wealth of the dominion of Canada for
1919 amounts to $7,379,299,000.
