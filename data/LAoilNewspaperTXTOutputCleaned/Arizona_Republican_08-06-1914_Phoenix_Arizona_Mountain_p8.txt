THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, THURSDAY MORNING, AUGUST 6, 1914

DON'T
RENT
YOUR
WATER

You can do this if you own

Only be to the expense of pumping when you want it. You
don’t have to take it when it is "served out to you" or run
the risk of losing it altogether, and you don’t have to pay
for it whether you get it or not.
If you are considering putting in a pumping plant, we can
fit you out. We carry the most complete line of ENGINES,
PUMPS and GENERAL PUMPING MACHINERY in the State.
We have an experienced erecting crew and an experienced
pump man in charge of that department, and are in position
to suit your requirements no matter what they may be.
We are state Jobbing Distributors for SAMSON WIND
MILLS, KOHL GASOLINE and OIL ENGINES, ADVANCE
CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS and many other lines of exclusive
pumping machinery.
