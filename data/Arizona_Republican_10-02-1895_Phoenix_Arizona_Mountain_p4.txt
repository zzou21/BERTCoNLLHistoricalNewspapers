Arizona's Trade To Be Appropriated.

Home-Cured Bacon for the First Time on the Local Market.

Active business in disposing of animals that cost him nothing. He will be tried today by Justice Johnstone. In the recorder's court yesterday, John Richards, an aggravated drunk, was fined $5 yesterday. John Doe, a plain drunk, and James Boger, ditto, were fined $3 each. Geo. Hogg, a vagrant, was arrested yesterday by Officer Bailey on suspicion of being one of the men who entered the residence of Geo. H. Smith near the Capitol grounds Monday night. He was very indignant when placed under arrest and showed a strong determination to resist the officer, but a scientific wrench of his arm made him change his mind. Mr. Smith is positive that he is one of the men.

Today the first product of bacon will be put on the market from the packing house of M. E. Hurley. Lard has already been on sale, and in another week or so sugar-cured hams of Arizona mark and make will be ready for local consumption.

This enterprise, though but a few weeks of age, has already demonstrated all its promoters hoped. All operations connected with the transformation of the wailing porcine into toothsome pork under various names has been found to work as well in Arizona as in the great packing houses of the east and the margin of profit is not hard to figure. It would seem as though this enterprise should be viewed with the utmost goodwill by the people of central Arizona. As conditions now exist, no less than four carloads a month of hog products are brought into Arizona from the east, necessitating a monthly return to Kansas City of an average of $10,000, cash that may now be saved to circulate within the community.

At present the Hurley pack will run 300 hogs per month, or something above 60,000 pounds to be advanced as a market is found for the local product. The valley has not for years had such a number of hogs as are at present being fattened, and of the supply of meat the local packers need never have cause for apprehension. Barley is now being fed by the farmers to harden the pork, and the present month will see heavy shipments of hogs both to Los Angeles and to eastern points.

WHAT THEY THINK OF US.

The Oklahoma Delegation Delighted With Phoenix.

Oklahoma State Capital: Agent L. R. Delaney, of the Santa Fe depot, returned today from Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he went as a delegate to the western interstate irrigation convention. He states the convention was a great success, and will prove of great benefit to the western states. The Oklahoma delegation consisted of himself, Hon. J. V. Admire, and Professor A. C. McGruder, formerly of the Stillwater college. Mr. Delaney states that the Oklahoma delegation was treated with marked attention everywhere, and that Professor McGruder, who was the formal speechmaker of the party, acquitted himself with great credit and was everywhere applauded with great enthusiasm. The convention was in Albuquerque three days and then sixty delegates went by invitation to Phoenix, Ariz., where they were entertained in great style. In two hours after their arrival, the citizens raised $1,000 for their entertainment, and would not let them spend a cent for anything. They were the city's guests. Mr. Delaney is very enthusiastic over the city of Phoenix. Its park, its electric street railways which, by the way, were entirely built there, he states are models of beauty. At the departure from there, Professor McGruder went to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, and Mr. and Mrs. Admire stopped on their way at Garden City, Kan.

IN THE PUSH.

Guthrie Leader: Prof. A. C. McGruder sends the Leader several copies of Phoenix, Arizona, papers containing complimentary remarks of Oklahoma delegation at the Irrigation convention. The Republican says: "A. C. McGruder of Oklahoma, said that his delegation cast ten votes for Phoenix at the congress. He considers Oklahoma a great territory, but as yet no great advancement has been made in irrigation. He spoke well of the Salt River valley and the bright future that lies before it. His remarks were highly complimentary to our country and were heartily applauded."

Afternoon Teas.
Flit Hartwell in her last syndicate article says: "I don't recommend any special brand of tea for afternoon four o'clocks. I do, however, know all about the best tea to take at night. Parks' Tea will certainly clear your complexion and purify your blood. You will be surprised at the improvement if you take a cup of Parks' Tea each night." Sold by C. Eschman & Co.

MINOR CRIMINALS.

The Record of a Day's Hunt for Vagrants.

A suit was filed in the district court yesterday by R. H. Campbell against the Farmers' and Merchants' bank of Tempe, for the recovery of the amount due on a certificate of deposit. The certificate called for $794 and was on the Commercial bank, of Moscow, Idaho. The Farmers' and Merchants' bank neglected to make collection on the deposit in time before the Commercial bank failed, so Campbell brought suit to recover the amount from them. Diego Romarro was yesterday arrested by Deputy Sheriff Charles Slankard on a warrant charging him with stealing three head of burros some weeks ago. He drove the animals to the city and sold them. Yesterday morning he came into town with eight more head that he was trying to dispose of when arrested. For some time he had been making a practice of stealing burros and did a lucrative business.

We hope to have a large delegation from all the unions of the territory. The delegates will be entertained free. Mrs. Kate H. Watrous, president; Mrs. Fred Hough, secretary. Furnished house to rent. Clark Churchill, 37 and 39 S. Center street.

For more than a hundred years the Shakers have been studying the remedial properties of plants. They have made many discoveries, but their greatest achievement was made last year. It is a cordial that contains already digested food and is a digester of food. It is effective in removing distress after eating, and creates an appetite for more food so that eating becomes a pleasure. Pale, thin people become plump and healthy under its use. It arrests the wasting of consumption.

There never has been such a step forward in the cure of indigestion as this Shaker Cordial. Your druggist will be glad to give you a little book descriptive of the product.

Give the babies Laxol, which is Castor Oil made as palatable as honey.
