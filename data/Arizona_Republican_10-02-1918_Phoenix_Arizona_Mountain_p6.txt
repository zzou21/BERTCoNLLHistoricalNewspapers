TOPIC OF REPORT
BY RESERVE BANK
The Federal Reserve Bank at San Francisco, in its summing up of business conditions in the southwest for
this date, says:
September 1, government report gives the condition of cotton as
92 in California and 96 in Arizona,
compared with 55.7 for the United
States. A yield of 100,000 bales is expected in California, compared with
67,000 bales last year. In Arizona a
crop of about 52,000 bales is predicted, compared with 35,000 bales in
1917. About 80 per cent of the Arizona crop is of the Pima variety of
Egyptian long-staple cotton.
In 1917 Arizona was the leading copper producing state of the Union, with
a production of 712,166,891 pounds,
38 per cent of the country's output.
This was 9,666,278 pounds less than the
production of 1916. With more settled
labor conditions this year, all previous
figures will probably be exceeded, with
an output estimated at more than
800,000,000 pounds."

Cicorge H. Smalley, secretary of the
Arizona food administration, announced last night that an agreement had
been reached in the matter of cotton
seed prices, and that the mills would
begin buying today on the basis of
$66 per ton in car loads, and $63 in
less than car lots.
Herbert B. Atha, of the Arizona
Egyptian Cotton company, stated that
he was ready to buy, and it is understood that the Phoenix Cotton Oil
company will also buy at once.
The price set is based on a freight
allowance to place the oil on the market in Los Angeles, a price of $51 per
ton for meal to cattle feeders, and a
price of $10 per ton for hulls, with
the agreement on the part of the oil
mills that in case a higher market can
be found for hulls and oil that they
will pay the growers pro rata whatever
the increase warrants, after the by
products have been marketed.
RED CROSS LINEN
SHOWER CALLED OFF
The "Linen Shower for France"
which was scheduled as the next activity of the Phoenix Red Cross, has been
postponed upon orders from Washington.
The local Red Cross, however, asks
each family to look over its supply of
linen for what it can spare, in order to
be ready when the call comes. It is
understood that the hospitals caring
for wounded Americans in France are
short of linen, and the committee desires that the citizens of Phoenix
should be ready, so that Arizona may
"go over the top" in the drive when it
comes.
