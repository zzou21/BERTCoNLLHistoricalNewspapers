ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
BOSTON, Oct. 11. The Big Batter
faced the Big Pitcher in crucial
innings of the world series between
Philadelphia and Boston today, and
the pitcher declined the challenge.
It was in the thrilling last half of
the ninth. The score of the third
game of the series was a tie. Harry
Hooper, the Boston right fielder, was on second
with only one out when Tris Speaker
leapt to hit, determination "face
fighting hope" in the swing of his
mighty career.

Big "Alex" looked up to
heed to the crowd, saw Speaker’s
club gleaming in the late
sun. His mind was made.

He pitched four straight wide ones.
Speaker’s wary eyes followed each.
The last went wide of the plate and turned a man
toward Alexander, the
ace of the Phillies, who
saw at a glance
that his pitching
arm, gave
Hooper’s war
hope. The afternoon was
done up. The
Red Sox had
won.

At plate and turned a
toward Alexander, the
ace of the Phillies, who
saw at a glance
that his pitching
arm gave
a sign of protest. Speaker’s war
hope was gone. The afternoon was
done up. The Red Sox had
won.

Hooper pranced down to second and third.
The thrilled throngs knew what it meant.
Alexander bowed in decision.
The fourth straight out for the mighty Phillies.

Left fielder of the Red
Sox, hit to first. This set the
ball in motion. Hooper follow-
ing with a slow double,
advancing, making third.

Lewis hit. He made
hit and Hooper crossed
the plate with the
winning run.

It gave the game to
Boston, by a score
of two to one, and
gave the series the third
straight victory.

SUGARKINGS
VS. COYOTES

Next Scheduled
Game With
Local Gridmen

Hard Practices for
Teams This Week

The next scheduled game will be
at Riverside park next Saturday
afternoon at 3:30, with
the High School.

The teams are in fine
trim and both are working
hard to be in fine shape for
the great contest Saturday. The In-
dians and Glendale are to follow
the High School on the list.

The fact that
some of the local school
gridders have got in practice
for six or seven
weeks will be in fine shape by
the time they meet the team
from the eastern part of the
valley.

The Coyotes started the
hard grind with a good humored
crowd, the machine working like a clock.
The team will probably take
the field tomorrow night. The team
is not exactly satisfied
altogether, owing
to their being
wet under
the weather.
Aside from
that, the
team is in
fine condition.

GOSHEN, TURKOVITCH
ALL TO THE BAD OFF!

A fast game was played between
Krainowitz’s Russians and
David White’s Turkish
ballists at the Y last even-
ing. The Turks, although playing a
good game, were not in their usual
form. The Russians excelled in team
work. The Russian team was made
up of Craig, Marks, I. Jones,
and Harry Shethl. The Turks,
Ira Redewill, Laven, de
Beih, P. Jones.

The next game will be between the
Wolves, captained by Elliott, and
the Kaisers, captained by Jarrott,
on Thursday evening.
Bill Earnhans was scorer; linemen,
A. Craig and B. H. Boardman.
In view of the popularity of the
tournament, the schedule will be
drawn so that each team will
play all other teams. The schedule
will appear in The Republican when
ready.

BOLLINGTON AND MAY
BACK FROM “BY-BY”

A lovely trip was had by
Bollington and Marcus May. They
returned yesterday, after they got in
communication and had made excavation
in a ton of desert dust that
was superimposed on account of desert
winds.
Bollington and May went several
days fishing in Bollington’s infinitesimal
automobile. How May, who is six feet
six, managed to “puzzle” himself up into
the car is a mystery. But he com-
plained of nothing except a mild dis-
comfort from the fact that the car
was not tailored to his measure.
Returning the Needles route, the
riders reported road conditions fair
and a happy vacation. Bollington is
manager of the Capital City Savings
and Investment company and May was
until yesterday deeply concerned with
the art of keeping on the Salt River.

Billy Cook and Doc Pardee
To Have Big Wild West Here

The greatest list of cowboy attrac-
tions that has ever been presented in
the state will be seen at the Arizona
State Fair rodeo this year. Cowboys
will be on hand from all parts of the
state to participate in these sports—
roping contests, broncho bucking, re-
lay races, pony express races, steer
riding, and all the events that so
attract the easterner who has never
seen the real western cattlemen in
action have been provided. Generous
prizes have been hung up, and every
provision made for clean sportsman-
ship in the cowboy sports department.
W. W. (Billy) Cook is superintend-
ent of this department of the fair’s
activities, and together with Secretary
Shaughnessy he has enlisted the
assistance of Doc Pardee, the north-
ern Arizona cowboy king, and to-
gether the three have laid plans for
the biggest and best of these sorts of
exhibitions that have ever been held
in the state.

The total purse on the roping con-
test amounts to $400. A like amount
figures in the championship broncho
riding contest, whilst all the other
sections of this interesting part of
the exhibition have been provided for
in the same liberal manner. Each
day there will be prizes for every
contest.

Numbers of cowboys from all over
the southwest have announced their
intention of attending the State Fair
for no other reason than that they
want to attend this portion of the
week’s activities. So important and
interesting does the fair commission
consider this portion of the program
that while the events are going on
in front of the grandstand there will
be nothing else to detract from the
importance of these events.

ONLY THREE GRID
PRIZES ARE GIVEN

Thomas Won Hat, Norton Football
and Walters a Pair of Sox

A ball without bullet is the same
as a football game without a touch-
down and for that same reason Vic
Hanny can keep his sweater that he
offered on the first touchdown in
Saturday’s Coyote-Alumni game.
Doniofrio can also keep a box of
chocolates he offered for the first
touchdown.

But the two pairs of silk sox of-
fered by W. P. Nelson for the most
sensational tackle were won by Ros-
well Walters, left half for Phoenix
High.

Oakley Norton, right half for the
Coyotes, gets the football offered by
Pinney & Robinson for the biggest
bone. Norton won this for not drop-
ping on the ball when it lay at his
feet for several seconds, for not drop-
ping on the ball, scoring a touchback
for the Alumni which counts against
the high school, thus winning the game
for the Alumni.

Jake Thomas won the hat offered
by Hyder Bros. for the longest run.
Jake got up on his legs and made a
long run of thirty-five yards, which
entitles him to the hat.

Manager Purvines of the Empress
theater will not have to give the
two tickets for the first goal kicked
as there was no chance offered to a
player to kick a goal.

These plays were judged by Dr.
Boyd Lytle Abbott and Francis
Geary.
