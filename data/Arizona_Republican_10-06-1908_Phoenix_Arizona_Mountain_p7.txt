COUNCIL MEETING
AN IMPORTANT ONE
A Half Dozen Matters of Interest to
All Citizens Were Acted Upon.
The big automobile race from Los
Angeles to Phoenix at the opening of
the fair, for the trophy cup offered
by The Arizona Republican, and
purses made up by the contestants,
will finish in front of The Arizona
Republican building on Adams street,
probably on November 8th. That fact
was settled last night when the city
council granted the petition of the
Automobile club, presented by Presi
dent Bollard, requesting the council
to instruct the city marshal to employ
a sufficient number of special officers
to patrol Adams street from its west
ern boundary to The Republican
building. It will be an event that will
give this city and the territorial fair
a vast amount of advertising and will
cost very little in either trouble or
expense. Councilman Marshall made
the motion of approval, adding paren-

making a hit. People hereabouts never knew what it meant
to conduct an absolutely appetizing meat dispensary till WE
entered the field. Come in Today when you're down town,
and let us show you the outer and inner workings of this

Location

Talk with your doctor about Ayer's non
alcoholic Sarsaparilla. Ask him if he pre
scribes it for pale, delicate children. Ask
him if he recommends it when the blood
is thin and impure, and when the nerves are
weak and unsteady. Ask him if it aids nature
in building up the general health. J. C. Ayer Co.,

thetically that there should be an am
ple number of men to fully guard the
highway and prevent accident.
There was much business before the
council of an important nature and
still more of lesser interest in addition
to the routine matters of municipal
business and the payment of claims
which amounted to the following
sums: general fund $6,820.56; water
works, $3,618.39; library, $180.87.
The council met first as a board of
equalization, adopted the tax roll, or
dered the mayor to sign it and ad
journed, reopening as a city council
and exempting from taxation,
churches, hospitals and charitable in
stitutions. The total valuation placed
on the property in the city by the roll
is $5,958,276.56, or in round numbers
$6,000,000.
William Evans in behalf of the fire
department requested the council to
pay the expense of training a team
to participate in the coming tourna
ment during the fair. His address was
a good one setting forth many rea
sons, for the encouragement of the
event and the recognition of the local
department, now the banner fire or
ganization of the territory with a
reputation to maintain. The depart
ment itself has raised $75 as a purse
for a foot race to help the tournament
along and inspire outsiders. The mat
ter was referred to Messrs. Marshall
and Cisney with power to act.
The mayor presented the offer of
United States Marshal Ben Daniels, to
rent the city hall apartment known as
the firemen's hall for offices of United
States marshal, court clerks etc., at a
price not named, the city to remodel
it to suit these needs, the government
with power to give up the quarters
at any time. It was estimated the
expense of the necessary changes
would be about $2,000. A letter was
read from the fire department pro
testing against being despoiled of its
hall and its sentiment found unani
mous favor with the council, the may
or being instructed to decline the of
fer of Mr. Daniels.
On recommendation of Superintend
ent Craig the council signed a con
tract with the C. C. Harris Oil Com
pany of Los Angeles to furnish fuel
oil for the city water works for the
next two years at $1.75 per barrel f.
o. b. Phoenix. This was advised be
cause the price has been raising for a
year and is believed to be of a cer
tainty going higher next year. The
old contract was $1.25 a barrel.
A representative of the firm main
taining the hide house on Jackson and
Fifth streets was present and said
he had understood there was a move
ment to have the maintenance of
such an institution prohibited within
the city limits by reason of its offen
sive odors. He said the company's
lease had expired and before he re
newed it he wanted to know if he was
likely to be forced to move. After
discussion a motion prevailed unan
imously that it was the sense of the
council that the business should be
removed beyond the city limits.
R. H. Greene addressed the council
in the matter of bringing the residence
section known as Evergreen Place
within the corporate limits, saying it
seems to meet with the general ap
proval of the residents and will add
much to the valuation of city prop
erty. In the event it is done however
the residents will demand a good wa
ter service, which is now being af
forded them by Mr. Greene and asso
ciates, by a private water plant val
ued at about $1700. He offered to
sell the city the pipe line portion of
the plant at cost, about $1,000. The
pumps and other machinery the city
probably would not need. The matter
was referred to the committee of the
whole and the city attorney.

Street lights were ordered at Ben
nett Lane and Seventh avenue, Tenth
avenue and Jefferson, Third avenue
between Van Buren and Bennett Lane,
South First street, and at one other
place on Bennett Lane.

Saratoga Chips Anti-dyspeptic.
Most dishes requiring deep frying
are denied the dyspeptic because they are
usually fried in lard, and lard does not
"agree." The following recipe will be
welcomed by those of poor digestion:
Peel the potatoes and slice thin into
cold water. Drain well, and dry in a
towel. Fry a few at a time in hot Cotto
lene. Salt as you take them out, and lay
them on coarse brown paper for a short
time.
The above recipe can be followed
without the least fear of disagreeable
after effects. The chips will be crisp
and dry not greasy, as when fried in
lard. Cottolene contains no hog fat,
but is made of purest vegetable oil; it
is recommended by physicians generally.

The Republican and Democratic Con
ventions to be Held Today.
The republican and democratic coun
ty conventions for the nomination of
candidates for the legislative and coun
ty offices will be held today, the form
er in O'Neill hall and the latter, in
the Olympic theater. Both will con
vene this morning at ten o'clock, but
the preliminary meetings will not like
ly be wildly exciting. For, while there
are several contests for democratic
nominations there are none of them
that would probably be affected by the
personnel of the preliminary organiza
tion. There are two very distinct fac
tions in democratic party of this coun
ty, but neither is at present contest
ing for supremacy.
On the republican side there are no
contests of any character. There is no
struggle anywhere for a nomination
and in the cases of most of the offices,
candidates have hardly more than been
suggested. It is certain that Judge
Phillips will be renominated for pro
bate judge. Dr. Wilbur of Mesa has
been quite extensively mentioned as
a candidate for the legislative council
and J. C. Rood of Wickenburg as one
of the four candidates for the assem
bly.
In the democratic ranks, the contests
involve the offices of supervisor, re
corder and county school superinten
dent. The latter is beginning to as
sume an acute form. While it is gen
erally believed that Superintendent Ful
ton will be renominated, some of his
opponents are openly working for C.
W. Alexander of Tempe, and J. A. Rig
gin of Cartwright. Other opponents,
more diplomatic are trying to force Mr.
Fulton to take the nomination for
probate judge. They are charging that
he has become fossilized and that
what the schools of the county need
just now is an infusion of new blood
and greater energy in direction.
Against the fossilization theory the
friends of Mr. Fulton point to the
steady progress of the schools under
his direction, until now they are second
to none in the country. Especial men
tion is made of the advance which has
been made in the country schools
which are alleged to be far superior to
schools of the same grade in the eas
tern states or in California. It is be
ing urged before the delegates that
when Mr. Fulton took charge of the
office there were no grades in the rural
schools and hardly more than a pre
tense of grading the city schools.
There is promise of a brisk fight for
the nomination for recorder. It is
generally predicted by the democrats
that Clay Leonard will be renominated
though the friends of C. M. Zander say
that the convention will be treated to a
surprise when the roll call on the vote
is under way.

Adams and First Sts.
It is admitted that L. M. Hoghe will
be renominated for the board of su
pervisors and yesterday it was the pre
ponderating opinion that the other
vacancy of the board would go to A.
Hunsaker of Mesa. No admission
of that sort however, came from the
friends of either T. N. Clanton of
Buckeye or J. T. Bone of Cartwright.
Sheriff Hayden and Treasurer Bab
bitt will be renominated without op
position. It is understood that T. E.
Powers will be given the nomination
for probate judge. No decision has
been reached among the leaders regard
ing the legislative ticket, though Eu
gene Brady O'Neill will almost cer
tainly be nominated for the council.
Candidates mentioned for the assembly
are Capt. J. W. Crenshaw, Sam F.
Webb, J. C. Goodwin of Tempe, W. B.
Lount and F. M. Avis.
For the precinct tickets, Justice
Johnstone and D. P. Kyle will almost
certainly be renominated by the re
publicans. Among the democratic as
pirants are W. W. Edwards and A.
Buck. Constables Murphy and Ivy are
again candidates, but their rights are
disputed by a score of aspiring peace
officers.
