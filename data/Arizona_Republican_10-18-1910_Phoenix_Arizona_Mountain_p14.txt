Diamonds have advanced 11 percent annually for the past nine
years. The cost of labor is higher in the South African mines. The
mines are growing deeper and the production less, while the de
mand is greater.
Hildebran's diamonds constitute one of the very best investments
because of our policy of handling only the finest and perfect
stones. This is the prime factor in our success as jewelers and
diamond merchants.

A LETTER

TO CITRUS GROWERS

It Announces Demonstration of Or
chard Heaters

The following letter from the horti
cultural commission is fully explana
tory and should interest every grower
of citrus fruits in this valley. It is sel
dom that artificial heating has to be
resorted to in this locality but it is
wise to be prepared always for an
emergency, for one cold night some
times works a disaster that would
more than offset the expense of pre
ventive measures for years:
October 15, 1910.

To All Citrus Growers of the Salt River

Valley:
The horticultural commission has
been corresponding with the various
manufacturers of orchard heaters, se
curing samples of the principal types
and obtaining information concerning
fuels, in order to place full information
on this subject before the citrus grow
ers. In both California and Florida more
citrus groves are being provided with
heaters than ever before, and Arizona
growers should decide at once whether
or not they can afford to be without

are right.

THE "OASIS,"
Glendale, is the place

this insurance against injury from
frost.

A few preliminary tests have been
made with the samples of heaters re
ceived, and it is desired that all citrus
growers interested examine the heaters
and note the comparative advantages
and disadvantages of the different
styles. A demonstration will be given
in Phoenix on Wednesday, October 19,
at 2 p. m., at the vacant lot east of the
Y. M. C. A. building. All information
concerning fuel can be obtained at that
time and detailed information concern
ing heaters and the claims of the va
rious manufacturers can be secured
from the advertising literature and cor
respondence which will be available for
reference.

As a rule the manufacturers have
been disposed to quote the lowest pos
sible prices in order to introduce their
heaters into Arizona, in two or three
instances making the delivered cost
here less than in California or Colora
do. Fuel will cost more than in either
California or Colorado, but by co-oper
ation in purchasing the best prices can
be secured on both heaters and fuel.
Enclosed herewith you will find a tab
ulated statement of information con
cerning the various heaters on the
market.

All of the manufacturers advise that
orders must be placed promptly in or
der for shipments to reach here by
December first and all interested
should decide upon the matter and
send in their orders before the end of
next week. Some growers will prefer
coal heaters while others will prefer
oil heaters. Some will prefer one style
of heater, others another style. In order to
secure favorable prices it is nec
essary for all who decide upon any one
style of heater to combine their orders.
The demonstration on October 19 will
give an opportunity for those present
to take advantage of this kind of co
operation. Yours very truly,

WHY ELECTION MARSHALS

ARE PAID ONLY $3

While Their Brother Officials Are

More Liberally Rewarded.

There are few, if any, busier hives
of industry about the capitol than the
office of Secretary Young, where a
bevy of beautiful young ladies are en
gaged in the work of settlement with
the thirteen boards of supervisors of
the territory for the expense of the
late election. These settlements in
volve not only a great deal of corres
pondence with the boards but also with
aggrieved members of the election
boards of the hundreds of precincts,
who have found Uncle Sam a much less
liberal personage than he had been re
puted to be.
The chief complainants are the elec
tion marshals, who find themselves
held down to a per diem of $3, while
other members of the election boards
got as much as $5.
One election marshal of Cochise
county attributed his shortened pay to
Secretary Young himself. He acknowl
edged the receipt of his voucher in sar
castic terms. He wrote, "Three dol
lars a day is the price we pay Mexi
cans in this part of the country. I'll ac
cept the salary but the next time you
want an election marshal here, you'll
get somebody else."

As a matter of fact, the office of
the secretary has nothing to do with
the compensation of election officials,
and especially with that of the office
of the marshal, whose per diem is fixed
by paragraph 2351 of the revised stat
utes at $3 a day. Somewhat curiously
the per diem of the other election of
ficers is not fixed and it has therefore
varied in different counties, according
to the breadth of supervisorial liberali
ty. In some of the counties, officials
had been allowed $5 a day and in oth
ers $10.

In view of this variation of compen
sation, which Secretary Young saw
would lead to inquiry at the depart
ment when the bills went in, he opened
negotiations with the members of the
various boards and suggested a uni
form per diem of, say, $5. That was
agreed to and that is why other offi
cials than marshals get that sum. The
marshals, whose compensation is fixed
by law, of course could get no more.
