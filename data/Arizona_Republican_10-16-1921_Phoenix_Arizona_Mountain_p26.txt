THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN, PHOENIX, SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 16, 1921.
(Section Three)

TWO TO APPEAR IN

PUBLIC CONCERT

Paul Saunders, violin virtuoso,
head of the violin department of the
Arizona School of Music, will appear
in public concert at the auditorium
of the school Monday evening, Octo-
ber 24, with Orley Ives, concert pia-
nist. All friends of the school and those
interested in the very best music are
cordially invited to be present and
enjoy and know the work of these
artists. They have recently returned
from a tour of concerts through New
Mexico, California and Arizona, and
are in splendid trim for the best
work.
Their program, which will appear
in these columns later, will include,
with other fine works, "Concerto Op.
1, F-Sharp Minor," by Vieuxtemps,
which was written by him after he
had met Paganini and heard him
play his famous "Paganini Concerto
in D Major," in the philharmonic
concerts in London, where each
played in 1834. Perhaps this fact
may give account for the similarities
that may be detected in the technical
and marvelous tone-passages that
are so evident. Mr. Saunders will
play the Paganini Concerto in an-
other program at a later date, to
show the wonder and comparison of
the two.
And Liszt Rhapsody No. 11, which
was written by a master of whom
was said: "His life might be divided
into five stages. The first as infant
prodigy, 'le petit Liszt;' second, the
slender romantic youth, M. Liszt, the
piano teacher of 1830; third, Liszt of
Weimar, conductor and propagandist,
the composer of symphonic poems,
the teacher to whom pupils flocked
from all over the world; fourth, Abbe
Liszt, in the monastery of Monte
Mario, near Rome, where for seven
years he wrote only masses and ora-
torios; fifth, Liszt, The Master.
And other fine works and master-
pieces, too.
In the United States army, navy
and Marine Corps, there are 587 com-
missioned officers who were born
under foreign flags.

MUSICAL NEWS IS
TO BRING GREATEST
ARTISTS TO PHOENIX
Mabel Garrison, soprano of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, who
will open the Musical Events course
in Phoenix on November 7, is one of
the young American singers who
have "made good" in many ways in
opera and concert. She was the
first American soprano engaged to
sing principal coloratura roles in the
Metropolitan and as Lucia came in
to her own just reward with positive
certainty. Her triumph was instan-
taneous and without qualification,
and after the mad scene she was
obliged to respond to a dozen re-
calls. She is a fitting artist to open
the club season of musical activity.
Mishel Piastro, the new (to this
country) Russian violinist, who will
appear here on December 2, is a mas-
ter of his instrument with a big, rich
tone, musicianly feeling and skill.
Last year, his first in America, he
was extolled as the best new violinist
of the season. He is no fledgling,
but comes to us as an artist of ma-
turity with a way all his own of
playing with ease and masterly tech-
nique of the most difficult passages.
A concert presenting two stars, to
be given on January 3, will be that
of Renato Zanelli, baritone of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, and
Grace Wagner, soprano, who has also
succeeded in opera and concert.
Caruso was responsible for Zanelli
being engaged with the Metropolitan,
for, after scoring notable operatic
success in South America, Zanelli ob-
tained a special audience with Caruso
in Buenos Ayres, who advised him to
go to New York City and apply at
the Metropolitan, which he did with
success, being engaged immediately.
He is a marvelous baritone, unassum-
ing and a thorough musician.
Grace Wagner uses her fresh,
bright soprano voice well. Her range
is extensive, she phrases beautifully
and brings to her performance real
sincerity. She is also a native
American and another girl whose
voice and ability cast credit upon
American musicians.
Pavlowa, the incomparable, with
her large company of assisting danc-
ers; Hubert Jay Stowitts, the Cali-
fornia boy who has succeeded beyond
all expectations as a choreographic
artist, and Alexandre Volinine, her
dancing partner, will be the February
number of the series. Of Pavlowa
nothing need be said; she is too well
known to need introduction here.
Stowitts was a student at Berkeley
when Pavlowa became interested in
him and offered him a position in her
company, and his achievements dur-
ing the past two seasons have been
phenomenal. Volinine has been with
Pavlowa for several seasons and his
dancing is on a par with that of any
of the great male dancers of the day.
Yolanda Mero, the pianist, will
close the series in April. Her tem-
perament, innate poetic feeling and
technical proficiency are of a high
order and she always gives a dazz-
ling performance. She has the gift
of eliciting from the piano that sing-
ing tone of which so few have the
secret.
The city is to be congratulated
upon having a club such as the Mu-
sical Events, whose members are
willing to do the hard, arduous work
of bringing to their home town the
best in music for the delectation of
the public.
The concerts are to be given at the
high school auditorium. Pavlowa
will appear at the Shrine auditorium
here.

A DARK FUTURE.

Brilliant Pianiste Who Will Be
Heard in Concert Here in April

splendid performer on the violin.

The orchestra practice of Mr.
Stuchal's old and new pupils is go-
ing forward with sure success and
the first public performance of this
splendidly conducted organization
promises to be a treat to all music
lovers.
Richard Wagner of Chicago will
arrive in Phoenix Sunday, and will
be associated with Walter Hastings
Olney of the Arizona School of Mu-
sic as studio pianist. Mr. Wagner
is a pianist of splendid ability as
well as much experience, having had
the advantage of study with Smis-
saert, pupil of Liszt, and has also
been in concert work for some time.

First of all, "What is it that con-
stitutes 'good' and 'bad' in music?"
"Nothing," said Carl Beutel in a re-
cent article in the Musical Courier.
Nothing in music is more distasteful
to the cultured music lover than the
lack of originality, and here we dis-
cover the most glaring flaw in our
popular music fabric. It is only
once in several years that a strictly
original attempt comes to our atten-
tion, and it immediately has a thou-
sand imitations.

Among the out-of-town pupils reg-
istered at the Arizona School of Mu-
sic this year are Robert and Made-
line Maddox of Bouse, Ariz., who
study piano under William Orth and
Mrs. Charles T. Weir, and expression
under Kathryn Ludden. In order to
secure the advantages of the school
they leave Bouse by train at 5 a. m.,
returning the same day at 11 p. m.

HIS CHOICE.

Young Everbroke Say, dad, what
is a preferred creditor?
Old Everbroke It's a matter of
taste, my son. I prefer the easy,
good-natured kind, with short memories.

A MATTER OF COVERING.

Clerk (displaying mourning goods
to young widow) Yes, madam, this
cloth wears like iron. A dress of this
material will easily serve you through
a second and third widowhood.

Little Elsie They're saying that
Aunt Lucy is a prude. What's a
prude, mother?
Mrs. Frank N. Posure A prude,
dearie, is a woman who wears two-
inch shoulder straps on her swimming
suit.

The study of eurythmics is invalu-
able to the pupil in music as it gives
an understanding of time not to be
acquired by simply practicing on the
keyboard. In the department of dra-
matics, interpretation and panto-
mime, the children will be taught to
interpret poems, stories, music, pic-
tures, friezes, statuary, etc.

Classes in oil and watercolor
painting now meet every Saturday
morning at the Studio Club. John
J. Coghlan, the teacher, is also making
arrangements to open classes at
Glendale, Mesa and Tempe.

Bertha Adair, the teacher of the
adult classes in ballroom dancing at
the Studio Club, is having more and
more calls for instruction. The
quiet studio, away from the atmos-
phere surrounding public dance halls,
is being chosen by people who wish
a more private place to go when
they go through the agony of learn-
ing to make their feet follow the one,
two, three of the music or more in-
tricate steps of the advanced student
of the terpsichorean art.

The children's ballroom classes
which lead up to the third annual
celebration of the children's Mardi
Gras festival which will be given in
March, is under the supervision of
Yua Sonstegard King. In this class
children from 3 to 13 are admitted.

A number of new pupils have reg-
istered with Frank Lloyd Stuchal in
the violin department. Among them
is the son of Dr. and Mrs. Redewill
of Desert Inn, who because of his
brilliant musical family cannot help
but give promise of becoming a
splendid performer on the violin.

THE MOST POPULAR
ROOM IN THE HOUSE
is that where the Victrola is located.
This matchless instrument is the never
failing source of entertainment in thou-
sands of happy homes.
Let us show you how
easy it is to own one.

WORKINGMEN’S OLYMPIC GAMES
"The first international working-
men's Olympic games were recently
held at Prague. Nearly 12,000 ath-
letes of both sexes, members of the
labor Turnvereins of Czecho-Slovakia,
Belgium, Germany, Finland, Sweden
and other countries, participated.
Notable attention is being given to
physical training and athletic sports
by most of the nations that fought
the last war. Some leading German
dailies have been publishing sporting
supplements — an innovation in that
country." — Living Age.

A series of pictures, mainly Ari-
zona scenes, is being arranged to
decorate the lobby of the Heard
building. It is interesting to the
friends of John J. Coghlan, the artist,
whose exquisite tinting of pictures
has won him a place of interest
among lovers of art, to know that
he has been awarded the work of
tinting the pictures which will be
placed on view in the Heard building
lobby.

Classes in dramatic acting, inter-
pretation, pantomime and eurythmics
will be organized in the dancing de-
partment of the Studio Club under
the supervision of Yua Sonstegard
King. The object of having these
classes is to help children acquire a
greater freedom of self-expression
and to teach children a higher and
more thorough conception of drama,
music and art than can be given in
the crowded routine of school work.
