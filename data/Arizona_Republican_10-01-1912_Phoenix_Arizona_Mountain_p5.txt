MASTERPIECE
OF SCULPTURE

Exact Copy of Houdin's
Life Size Statue of
George Washington to be
Placed in High School
Auditorium.

Within the next few days Professor
Stabler of the high school will place
an order with the C. Henneeke com
pany of Milwaukee, Wisconsin for a
cast of Houdin's famous statue of
Washington. The funds for this pur
chase were provided by the seniors of
1912, who left the high school over one
hundred dollars to be devoted to the
purchase of some object of art.
In its history the original statue is
connected with many of the great
names in American history. In 1785
the state of Virginia resolved to erect
a statue of Washington and the gov
ernor set about finding an able artist.
Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jef
ferson were then in Paris on a diplo
matic mission and on their recommen
dation Jean Antoine Houdon was in
vited to come to America and under
take the great work.
Houdon was one of the foremost

French sculptors of the eighteenth
century. Born in the household of a
courtier at Versailles when the splen
dor of the French court had almost
reached its zenith, he came early under
the influence of the decorative sculp
ture in and about the royal palace. He
studied in the French royal school and
at Rome. Several of his works are
still to be found in the churches of the
eternal city, but the larger number are
in Paris. He executed busts in bronze
or marble of such famous men as
Franklin, Rousseau, Moliere and Vol
taire. Houdon came to America with
Franklin and spent three weeks at Mt.
Vernon, George Washington's home, in
October 1785. During that time he mod
eled a bust of General Washington as
exact in all its lineaments as his skill
could make it. When the full length
statue was completed it was placed in
the capital building at Richmond, Vir
ginia, where it stands today, probably
the most perfect likeness in exist
ence of the Father of America.
The cast to be placed in the high
school auditorium is an exact repro
duction in plaster of the marble origi
nal. With the base it stands six feet
and ten inches high, and weighs nearly
a thousand pounds when crated for
shipment.
The "Washington" will stand on one
side of the auditorium stage and a
companion piece of Lincoln will be
placed on the other side in the near
future.
The high school owes much to the
generous graduates of 1912. Certainly
they could have left behind no fitter
token of their love for the "old high"
than this statue of the greatest
American.

COLQUITT OUT
WITH PROTEST

Governor of Texas
tempts to Withdraw

Consent for

Mexican Troops To
His State.

Passage

At
this of

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
AUSTIN, Sept. 30. Governor Col
quitt today withdrew his permission
for Mexican troops to cross Texas ter
ritory from Eagle-Pass to Del-Rio and
Marathon, stating he did "not care to
take the risk." The governor sent the
following message to the secretary of
state at Washington, "concerning the
movement of Mexican troops through

Texas from Eagle-Pass to Marathon or

Del Rio, my adjutant-general calls at

tention to the fact it is to be a rough
70 mile march. I desire to withdraw

my consent for the passage of these

troops through Texas until I am ad

vised more fully with reference to
their movement. This march of 70
miles through territory referred to,
will invite difficulties which I do not

want to occur in Texas."

WOULDN'T MAKE DIFFERENCE

WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. Even if
it would have any effect, which is con

sidered doubtful, the objection of Gov

ernor Colquitt, of Texas, to transfer
Mexican troops through a portion of

that state under the permission ne

corded by Secretary of State probably
will come too late to be considered. It
is said at the state department that

Colquitt's consent was asked as a mat
ter of courtesy. That his consent hav

ing been given, the state department
gave its own permission and General

Steever was ordered today to furnish

proper escort and "see the Mexican

troops safely through the territory cove
red by the permit.
Up to the time the state depar
tments led for the day, Col

quitt's message asking to withdraw the

original consent had reached neither

department.

SOCIALISTS AFTER MADERO.

EL PASO, Sept. 30. Senator Fall, of

New Mexico, a member of the senate
committee investigating the report

that Americans fostered the present
Mexican revolution, declared today
that evidence had been secured on the

Pacific coast that the so-called socialist

element was attempting to unseat

Madero, after assisting in the unseat

ing of Diaz and that the plan was to

set up a socialistic government in

Mexico. He declared some evidence
tended to show that certain labor and

political elements in the United States
were assisting Mexican socialists to
this end. The "Industrial Workers
and the Western Federation of Miners
were mentioned in the evidence" he

said.

any way at any time in the troubles
in Mexico as an organization or as In
dividuals, as far as I know" said Moy
