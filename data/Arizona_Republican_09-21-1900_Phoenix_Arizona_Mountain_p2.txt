Colonel Bryan secured his military
title through appointment as com
mander of a regiment in the recent war—a
command which he re
signed while the war
was yet in progress, in
order, as he said, that
he might feel himself free to talk pol
itics. Major McKinley went into the
war of the rebellion a private soldier
with musket and knapsack on his back.
By brave and soldierly conduct he went
up through the several grades of the
non-commissioned staff and finally
earned a commission. He stuck to his
soldierly duties from 1861 to 1865, and
when the war was over he was mus
tered out of the service of his country
at the age of 21 with the rank of cap
tain and the brevet rank of major. He
felt no call to leave his country’s army
in order to talk politics. He was there
to uphold the flag, to preserve the re
public, to put down rebellion. Mr.
Bryan was not of an age to get into the
civil war. If he had been it is doubtful
if he would have joined the Union
forces. He is represented as a dutiful
son, much devoted to his father, a gen
tleman whose sympathies were with
the south and the cause of secession.
A comparison of the military records
of these two American soldiers is use
ful because it gives substance and
meaning to their present attitude with
respect to the issue of “imperialism.”
Mr. Bryan, the man who resigned his
commission in the midst of a war in
order to have the privilege of engag
ing in politics, charges the man who
fought four years to preserve the
American republic with the present
purpose of destroying that republic and
erecting a monarchy in its stead. And
now the question is, what are the prob
able facts with respect to the spirit and
intention of the man so accused?

Mr. Bryan has grown wonderfully
eloquent over his alleged devotion to
the cause of freedom and self-govern
ment. Yet in this respect his eloquence
has been surpassed by the utterances
of President McKinley, which, if less
frequent, have the ring of absolute
sincerity. The president has not
deemed it necessary to din continually
into the ears of the American people
the boast that he is loyal to the spirit
of the American republic. On occasion
he has given voice to sentiments that
could only proceed from the heart of a
pure patriot, and it is to a few of these
that we would invite attention:
“We are not a nation of classes, but
of sturdy, free and independent and
honorable people, despising the dema
gogues and never capitulating to dis
honor.”
“The American people have never
failed, no matter how great the crisis,
to measure up to the highest responsi
bilities of honor and duty.”
“Let us keep steady hearts and
steady heads. The country is going
not backward, but forward.”
“In this contest all the banner we
want is the American flag; it repre
sents all our aims, our plans, our pur
poses. It was never degraded or de
serted, and it will not be now, when
more patriotic men are guarding it
than ever before in our history.”
“No blow has been struck except for
liberty and humanity, and none will
be; we will perform without fear every
national and international obligation.”
“We have been moving in untried
paths, but our steps have been guided
by honor and duty. No imperial de
signs lurk in the American mind. They
are alien to American thought and pur
pose. Our priceless principles undergo
no change under a tropical sun. They
go with the flag.”
“Our flag is there, not as the symbol
of oppression, not as the token of tyr
anny, not as the emblem of enslave
ment, but representing there, as it does
here, liberty, humanity and civilization.”
“The republican party was dedicated
to freedom forty-four years ago. It
has been the party of liberty and eman
cipation from that hour; not of oppres
sion, but of performance. It broke the
shackles of 4,000,000 slaves and made
them free, and to the party of Lincoln
has come another supreme opportunity
which it has bravely met in the libera
tion of 10,000,000 of the human family
from the yoke of imperialism.”
And yet the man who breathes these
patriotic sentiments is accused by his
rival in the presidential election of
being at the head of a conspiracy to
overthrow a government of freedom
and establish an empire in its stead.
The American people are asked to be
lieve that this man, who gave four
years of his life to fighting for the re
public when it really was assailed;
who came up from the people and loves
the institutions of liberty—they are
asked to believe, we say, that he is a
traitor to honor, justice, truth, freedom
and the flag! And who are his accus
ers? They find their strongholds in the
states where “Major” McKinley fought
to preserve the Union. They find their
mouthpiece in “Colonel” Bryan, who
left the flag to engage in the peaceful
and profitable occupation of slandering
his country’s saviors!
