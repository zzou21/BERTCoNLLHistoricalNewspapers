PHOENIX, ARIZ., OCT. 19, 1907.

A SCIENTIST’S DISCOVERY.

The “affinity” brotherhood and al-
lied host will be delighted with the
facts brought to light by V. Stefansson,
ethnologist of the Leffingwell-Mikkelsen
polar expedition, touching the Eskimo
custom of “trial marriages.” In vogue
among the Eskimos of Alaska and other
Arctic tribes, Mr. Stefansson is enthusi-
astic on the subject. He finds social
conditions among the northern people
idyllic.

At the age of fifteen or sixteen a youth
marries a girl of about his own age.
There is no ceremony, and the union
rarely is permanent. That is not
expected. After awhile they separate
with mutual consent and another “wife”
is taken. Generally that marriage is
tentative also. The young fellow is
experimenting. But the third trial
usually proves a success, and the
pair live together happily ever after-
ward. How beautifully romantic! Life
has its young dream, a rosy but evanes-
cent vision. Then it takes a world
view which is a little more practical,
perhaps, and then comes the third af-
fair, which in many cases there and
in the police court marks one’s “fin-
ish.” There is one cloud on the horizon
of these simple-hearted and happy
people. They are in danger of becom-
ing “civilized” and of getting “religious.”
The coming of the white man and ac-
ceptance of Christianity upsets the whole
system. They are a peculiar race.
Among all other people conversion
to Christianity has meant moral, so-
cial and spiritual uplifting and pacifi-
cation, while looseness of domestic ties
has been the sure sign of baseness or
degeneracy.

It is in the far North that these
rules are reversed. There, among the
unenlightened and uncultured Eskimos who
practice “trial marriage,” may be
found a family life which Mr. Stefans-
son pronounces “superb.” The only
exceptions to this are those who have
come under the influence of mission-
aries, Christianity and religion.

There is no opinion, theory or doc-
trine too wild, bizarre and grotesque
for the modern scientific sensational-
ist. To say that a man is a “scientist”
nowadays is almost a reflection on his
common sense or intellectual honesty.
Mr. Stefansson is a biologist. Possibly
he is an expert in that line; but judging
from the report credited to him, his
antipathy to Christianity and religion
is his strongest passion.

The assurance of a man who will
compare the barbarous domestic prac-
tices of the Eskimos with the home
and marriage life of Christian lands
is too great to be measured in any
scales excepting those used by astron-
omers. If society is so charming
among the Eskimos why did not Pro-
fessor Stefansson remain with them
and take to himself in succession half
a dozen wives?

NO CAUSE FOR NERVOUSNESS.

The Albuquerque Journal says “Ari-
zona is on the ragged edge of nervous
prostration while Governor Kibbey is
talking to Teddy.” We cannot imagine
how the Journal ever acquired any
such impression. Arizona has been
at all times singularly free from ner-
vousness and there was never a time
when the blood flowed more evenly than
it does at this moment. The residents
of this territory can conceive of nothing
which might come up in the Vicks-
burg conference which could vitally af-
fect them, one way or another. The
president has already assured us that
he has abandoned his joint statehood
notions and anything he might say to
Governor Kibbey on that subject would
be merely reiteration. Some have sus-
pected that perhaps he intends to in-
form the governor that he has still
further modified his statehood views
and is prepared to further this terri-
tory’s aspirations toward single state-
hood. But we are not nervous about
that, either.

In fact, we are apprehensive of noth-
ing at all. We do not believe that the
president has any designs against us.
He probably merely wants to swap a few
of Governor Kibbey’s stories of the
bear hunt in the canebrakes. There’s
nothing impending or possible to cause
alarm.

The Appeal to Reason finds in the
fact that postage stamps alone of all
commodities have not advanced in
price, a further argument in favor of
socialism. In the first place, the law
of supply and demand could not affect
postage stamps. The cost of their
production has not increased. The ex-
penses of the postoffice department
are regular by reason of advances here
and there in the wages of employees,
but the postoffice department does not
care for little things like that. The
department has frequently found itself
confronted by a startling deficit at the
end of the fiscal year, but that did not
worry the department. Altogether as a
business enterprise, the postoffice de-
partment and its methods would not
excite the emulation of those who are
obliged to make both ends meet.

Now an “officious lady friend” of
the Fairbanks family is blamed for in-
cluding cocktails so disastrously at
the big wet given to President Roose-
velt in Indianapolis. The women
have usually been set in some line.
Somebody connected with the Standard
Oil Company is going to have a
bad half hour when Mr. Rockefeller
hears about that missing $700,000 and
the vain inquiries to find out what
became of it.

Dr. Wiley might have spared his
breath in warning the slaughter of
bears that was to take place in the Louisiana
canebrakes, considering that President
Roosevelt has so far slaughtered only
one.

A herd of buffalo has been sent from
New York City to Oklahoma. Okla-
homa will unquestionably reciprocate
by sending a shipment of lambs to
Wall Street.

Mr. Rockefeller’s doctor says the
Americans are perpendicular drinkers,
which doubtless is one way of saying
they take it straight.

WOMEN DON’T KNOW HOW TO
REST.

They Should Plan Their Labor With
Allowance for Relaxation.

The trouble with most women is they
don’t know how to take things easily,
says the Delineator for October. They
think that because they have many
things to which they must give their
attention, they must keep steadily at
work until the last task has been ac-
complished, when, as a matter of
fact, a minute’s rest now and then
would give a great deal more energy
to be expended in disposing of these
manifold duties.

Think, if the housewife is her own
cook, she will find countless oppor-
tunities to rest a minute while work-
ing in the kitchen. One woman has
a lounge there. It is not such a lounge
as she might place in her parlor, per-
haps, but it is a possible resting place,
and, what is also to the point, it cost
next to nothing, for she made it with
her own hands. To do this she first
secured two long boxes from one of
the neighboring stores, and these she
nailed together, end to end. Around
all four sides she tacked some strips
of dark-colored denim, and upon the
top of the boxes she placed a good, firm
thick mattress, which she had covered
with some attractive but washable
material. A soft pillow or two, covered
with the same material, added the one
touch necessary to make the
invention complete.

Comfortable? No, it may not be
as comfortable as a couch from the
furniture shop, but it will answer the
purpose.

Moths and Rugs.

Furs, such as dog and goat-
skins, are not attacked by moths, be-
cause in curing and dyeing them pois-
ons are used that make them practi-
cally immune from attacks by these
insects; but the contrary is true of the
natural skins, such as polar bear, tiger,
leopard, etc., for, though the curing
process they go through contains more
preservatives than are put into that
used for muffs, boas, etc., they are
much more likely to attract the de-
structive insects than those that are
dyed.
