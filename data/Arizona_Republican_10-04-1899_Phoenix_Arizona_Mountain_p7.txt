ANES AN
THE VAGARIES OF GEOLOGY.
. . .
It is not strange that geologists do
not always agree upon the origin of
geological occurrences which are not
manifestly plain to all, says the Mining
Superintendent Press No geologist.
A man who has seen it, will dispute that the

Grand Canyon of the Colorado river, in Arizona, has been formed by the sro-
sive effect of the river and its sediment,
securing throughout a long period while the land was slowly rising. There are, however, other geological
features less profound but far more
difficult of interpretation. The correlation of geological formations far re-
moved from each other is one of the
most difficult problems with which the
geologist has to deal, particularly in
the case of azoic rocks which, containing no fossils, leaves their determination to lithological features only, and
consequently geologists do not always
agree as to the age of this formation
or that.
An overturned fold often results in
a perplexing problem where the exposures are poor, occurring only in
patches, and when the result is ob-
served that of an older formation
lying upon a younger there appears
room for discussion as to the existing
conditions. The age of certain uplifts
has been the cause of much discussion,
and in the determination of the facts
geologists are not always of one mind.
To one the evidence may indicate that
the occurrence took place during cre-
taceous time, and another will find
what he considers sufficient evidence to
justify the belief that it did not occur
until the tertiary period.
Often when a mining geologist goes
to examine a mine for the first time he
forms impressions which seem well
founded, but a subsequent observation
and more careful study satisfies him
that his first impression was incorrect.
Had he not gone back and taken a
more careful look he would have left
the place satisfied as to the character
of the occurrences, and another coming later, discovering the true conditions, a disagreement would arise. All
are liable to error, and one should not
condemn too hastily the opinion of an-
other without first investigating from
the standpoint of view of the other.
It is an uncommon thing to find carboniferous limestones and schists lying
upon quarternary gravels, yet such an
occurrence exists in California, in the
Black Hawk mountains of San Bernardino, county. It is the result of a
thrust fault, but it should be seen to be
understood. Faults are important factors in the earth sculpture in some re-
gions, and the fact that the puzzling
conditions observed are not readily un-
derstood suggests the necessity for
study in that direction.
The practical miner gives most of his
thought and attention to the conditions he finds from day to day in his
shaft or in the face of his drift, giving
little thought to the broader questions
involving the origin of his vein and its
relation to its surroundings. He ex-
poses the evidence of nature's work
for observation, but destroys the
evidence as he goes, and too often pays
little heed to it.
MINING NOTES.
No country in the world, says the
Mining and Engineering Review, has
furnished so much coin as Mexico.
The mining have coined money with a
constancy and in a quantity never
equalled by any other country. The
mints in the Zacatecas have coined silver coins at the rate of from 1,000 to 5,000,000 a year from the sixteenth century to the present time.
Even during the war of independence,
from 1811 to 1837, $60,332,080 were
coined. Large as the amounts coined
try the different states of Mexico have
been, they sink into insignificance
when compared with the amount coin-
ed by the mint at the capital. It has
coined from 1790 to 1803 $1,353,000,000,
and from the conquest to its independence $2,028,000,000. The amount to
the present time exceeds $3,000,000,000.
The last shipment of ore for me,
Nyack Mining company from this point
under the supervision of the company's
general manager, averaged 21 per cent,
and a fraction. Mr. Helmle has a
number of teams busy hauling ore in
from the canyon mines, as it is a profitable proposition even with the long
haul and expense attendant at such a
smelter yield. A shipment made this
mining company is expected to exceed
8 per cent of the last shipment.

E. Kinerg recently made a rich
strike on his claim known as the
Dewey mine at the head of the canyon
near Quito creek, about seventeen miles
from Oracle, says the Tucson Star.

runs the hotel in Yellowstone park in
summer and comes down here to look
after his mine in Minnehaha Flat in
winter, where he has resided for the
past two winters. A hoist has just
been completed on this mine and a
stamp mill has been ordered. Prescott
Courier.
The business of the Arizona Copper
company has increased to such an ex-
tent within the past year or so that it
has entailed upon Mr. Colquhoun more
work than is usually allotted to one
man to do. This enormous increase
of business of this company has been
brought about by the untiring efforts
of Mr. Colquhoun, the general superin-
tendent, and as a reward for his work
and ability displayed has placed an as-
sistant superintendent in the field that
he (Mr. Colquhoun) may have a sur-
cease from his labors. In giving him
an assistant the company has shown
their appreciation and gratitude for
the great work he has done for them
and he has well merited it. The as-
sistant is no stranger to the people of
Clifton, as he formerly resided here,
some three or four years ago, holding
an important position with the com-
pany at the time. His name is Murray
Innes, and the people of Clifton will
give him a most cordial welcome when
he dons his harness for his new posi-
tion. Mr. Innes has many friends in
this region, is deservedly popular, and
it goes without saying that he will lose
none of it during his reign as assistant superintendent of the Arizona Copper company. It was while he was in
the employ of the company that he displayed the business and tact that has
gained for him the new honors that
have been "thrust upon him," and the
Era predicts for him still greater
honor. Clifton Copper Era.
The Regales Oasis says Messrs. L. C.
Shattuck, John Keating and Charles
Evans of Bisbee have bought about
5,000 tons of tailings at the San Miguelito mine, about 100 miles south of
Bisbee, and have put up a cyanide
plant to extract the values. They are
working under royalty to the Mexico
Gold and Silver Recovery company.
Mr. Evans is on the ground in charge
of the works.
The "original locator" can locate as
many more claims as he wants to, and

able in proportion to its area, being
assessed at the same rate as agricultural land, the improvements being
also taxable. Ex.

A THOROUGHBRED.
He was delighted to meet the bunco
man.
He sat his glipback down in the
middle of the street to talk over old
friends in the town where both had
spent their happy boyhood days. He
took off his silver rimmed spectacles
and wiped them with his red cotton
handkerchief, so as to get a better look
at the nephew of his dear old friend.
"Did I understand you to be inquirin'
whether I had any sportin' blood in
my veins?" he asked after the other
had said something in a low tone.
"Well, I should surmise that I've got
a few drops. But I don't play only one
game. Faro? No, 'tain't faro. You
git on even chances for yer money at
some stages of the game in faro, so I've
heard tell. 'Tain't risky enough for
No; 'tain't roulette, nor yet poker

down on the table and where it's all
over in a minute or two. 'Tain't horse

quick action, but gimme something ling-
ting, something where the suspense hangs
right over ye and you hold yer breath
till ye gotter swing yer arms to re-
suscitate yerself. Every year I take
off my spring outfit and cornfield and
lay-out. I put some of it on cats and
some of it on corn and some of it on
wheat, with a few side bets on sweet
corn and various fancy vegetables.
Then I git out every mornin' and bet
day's work and watch cut for the
weather, week after week, and spend
my nights wonderin' about grasshop-
pers and locusts and seen. It takes a
long time to find out whether I win or
not, but it's mighty interestin', and I
like an excitin' life. You might wait
for some of the hired hands to come
to town and git 'em to take a hand in
the small amusements you've mentioned. But you might as well bear in
mind that when you tackle a first class
farmer you're goin' up agin' one of the
sportiest people on earth." Washington

MR. DUNNE'S IMPRESSIONS

Almost Everybody in Ireland.
Says, is Like Mr. Dooley.
He
"Dooley" is in New York. He is reg-
istered as Finley Peter Dunne, and a
reporter for the Commercial Advertis-
er found him today. The bright young
Chicagoan was in his tub when dis-
covered. "I am removing some of my Irish
reminiscences," he said. "I have spent
the summer abroad and my visit to
Ireland was in every respect the most
notable of all.
Here the author of "Dooley" emerg-
ed from the bath room and looked for
an immaculate collar.
"Such things," he said, "are more in
style in New York than in Ireland.
"The Irish are an agricultural peo-
ple," he resumed, "and that may ac-
count for some of their ideas about
linen. I found that almost everybody
in Ireland is more or less like Mr.
Dooley. The habit of having impres-
sions on political subjects is well dis-
tributed in the land of Cork. Almost
anybody there sees something in his
own Irish way. In London it was
quite different. There the ordinary
hansom driver or coachman has opinions about politics, but they are not
his own. They think in types in Eng-
land. In Ireland, however, it's the
man that thinks."
Mr. Dunne was very enthusiastic
about the beauty of Ireland. "It is
worth going there," he said, "simply to
see the color. It is a fine green, very
soft. Its softness is its peculiarity. It
is the only green thing about the place,
however, except the visitors. Indeed,
one of the characteristics of the Irish
is their commercial shrewdness. One
time at an inn I gave up a half sovereign
to pay a bill of four shillings. The
man touched his cap and said:
'Thank'ee, sir,' and pocketed the
change."
"Why is it, then, that your ordinary
Irishman is a poor devil?"
"Partly," Mr. Dunne replied, "be-
cause they are agricultural people and
the land is very poor. They have had
a hard struggle for existence. But
when they come here they make for-
tunes. Some of the richest bankers I
knew are Irishmen. I don't mean to
suggest that I have a very large ac-
quaintance among bankers.
"The Irish govern well, too, when
they get over here," he resumed. "Look
at Richard Croker. Perhaps it is be-
cause only the most energetic of them
leave their native land. Between 1820
and 1860 a large crowd of the best
Irish immigrated to this country. I
think Croker must have come over
then.
"Speaking of bankers," said Mr.
Dunne, "reminds me that I am going
to have another book published soon.
It will contain some Dooley papers I
wrote too late for the last book and
five sets of Dooley opinions on the
Dreyfus case. In one of these papers
Mr. Dooley discourses on the Guerin
Ficrt Chambrol matter. If my pub-
lishers, Smith & Maynard, will get a
big sale for this book and the public
co-operate I will promise not to write
any more. So that if the people will
buy my book they can kill two birds
with one stone.
"Part of my summer I spent in
Paris," proceeded Mr. Dunne. "It was
a very quiet summer. The Paul Der
oulede incident was a tame affair. On
the 14th of July thousands of Ameri-
can girls assembled before the statue of
Alsace-Loraine to hear M. Deroulede
deliver a revolutionary address. M.
Deroulede appeared, followed by
twenty decadent poets. A policeman
told him he could not speak.
"Tres bien," said M. Deroulede, and
he and the twenty poets with long
hair and anaemic faces went away.
That was the most exciting incident of
the summer. The next day the Lon-
don papers had full accounts of the
speech that was not delivered."
"What are your impressions of Eu-
rope, Mr. Dunne?"
"When I was in London," he replied,
I got some excellent impressions of
America. I saw fine specimens of
Americans wherever I went. Ameri-
can plays were at the theaters, Ameri-
cans in the hotels, restaurants, streets,
all public places. It was hard to find
an Englishman. In Paris, too, I had
some good impressions of America.
Now and then, however, I did see a
Frenchman. I could identify him by
what he said: 'Couptez Zola!' 'A
bas Dreyfus!' 'Vive l'armee!' etc. Since
I returned to New York my impres-
sions of America have been strengthened." Chicago, Times-Herald.
A REMARKABLE OPERATION.
Walter Duryea, Who Broke His Neck,
Will Recover.
As the result of a rare operation per-
formed in Roosevelt hospital Monday
Walter A. Duryea, who was taken
there more than six weeks ago with a
broken neck is expected to recover.
Physicians and surgeons in all parts
of the United States have awaited with
keen interest the outcome of efforts
that have been making to save Dur-
yea's life. His injury, similar to that
which caused the death of Mrs. Wil-
liam C. Whitney, baffled his physicians
for weeks, and several times they gave
up all hope of saving his life. They
obtained X-ray photographs of his
spine, however, and thus located his
injury so accurately that an operation
which might be successful was decided
to be possible.
Edward E. Duryea, father of the suf-
ferer, is a wealthy starch manufacturer
in Glen Cove, L. I. Walter is his only
son. An operation was proposed to
Mr. Duryea, and he let his consent de-
pend upon the wishes of his son.
Walter, after listening to an explana-
tion of his injury, pluckily directed
that the operation be performed. He
discussed it with eagerness and looked
forward with interest to the time when
the surgeons would perform their
work.
About a dozen medical men were in
attendance; Theodore Bruen,

ERGIFROYAL FILLS

young Duryea's room, in a private
ward at Roosevelt hospital Monday
afternoon when the operation was per-
formed. Louis Duryea, a cousin of the
patient, was the only relative present.
The operation was begun at a quarter
to four o'clock, and it was finished in
forty minutes.
The exact nature of Duryea's injury
and many of the details of the opera-
tion performed Monday have been
carefully guarded. The patient sus-
tained a fracture of the fifth vertebra
on August 7 while living in shallow
water at Oyster Bay. He was taken to
his home in Glen Cove, but his life
was despaired of. Several of the most
eminent surgeons in the city were
summoned, and the father of the in-
jured man gave directions that no ex-
pense should be spared to save his
life. It was thought, however, that
nothing could be done. Young Duryea
was athletic and of splendid courage,
and he bore his suffering with such
rare pluck that his attendants took
heart. He was removed to a private
room in Roosevelt hospital, and his
fight for life speedily won the admira-
tion and interest of his own and other
physicians. The operation does not re-
store the spinal cord to its natural
place, leaving it pushed outward
slightly. But the pressure on the cord
is thought to have been relieved suf-
ficiently to give the patient a splendid
chance for life.
Duryea was conscious throughout
the operation. Cocaine was applied
about the point at which the incision
was made, but the patient at times suf-
fered considerable pain. He was cheerful throughout the operation, and at
all times showed the keenest interest
in what the surgeons were doing, reali-
zing that upon their success depended
his life.
Young Duryea is expected to remain
in perfect quiet in the hospital for
several weeks. No immediate change
in his condition is expected to follow
the operation. New York Herald.
