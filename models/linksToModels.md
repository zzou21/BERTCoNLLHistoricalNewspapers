#### Other models created during hyperparameter testing:
I trained my models in Google Colab, and for some reason (probably due to file size), I just couldn't download the models from Google Colab, and Google Colab clears runtime after 90 minutes, so I don't have a link to the models. But I have attached a screenshot showing the models that I've made: [https://duke.box.com/s/rnjcutx3s6rxh19w7gqky1sdc2ui04z4](https://duke.box.com/s/rnjcutx3s6rxh19w7gqky1sdc2ui04z4)
